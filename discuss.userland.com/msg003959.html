And keep the name, I always thought the play on MS's 'Blackbird' was fun.<p>

Hmm, what ever happened to Blackbird anyway?<p>

And even though we all cursed in chorus about the crashing editor, I'd looove to have it back, in some form or another.  HTML GUI's are great, but there's nothin' like MacBird.<p>

Or here's a thought--if someone brought MacBird to NT, I'd definitely do another TipCenter.  That was so much fun...
