I see only one glitch in log.addToGuestDatabase. This line should go away:<p>

   try {delete (@[f].["item #1"])}<p>

In general, there's no need to explicitly delete the default item anymore, unless your script is making assumptions about what else is in the table and an extra item will screw it up. In 5.1.5, these default items take care of themselves; they will go away.<p>

In this case, there's no way a default item can appear spontaneously after you just created the table and haven't opened it. And "f" is undefined, so this try is always failing anyway -- after burning a few cycles.  ;-><p>
