TBL certainly holds absolute power within the W3C.</i><p>

Within the W3C. How much power does the W3C have?<p>

<i>This may be an interesting study over time, because from what I have gleaned, the image of TBL is generally that of someone uncorruptible (and I certainly have no knowledge to the contrary).</i><p>

Considering that he's not in it for the money, all that's left is his reputation. If he started absuing his position, the W3C's relevance would vanish.<p>

<i>2) On the more mundane side, but not unrelated to #1, even if he has not used this power up till now, the threat of the veto (either implicit or explicit) may well have exerted influence any number of times.</i><p>

I hope so. <b>Someone</b> has to keep the Web's best interests in mind.
