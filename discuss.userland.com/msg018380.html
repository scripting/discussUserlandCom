Lucky for Hollywood that the digital pipes aren't generally fat enough to move full-length movies through. They'll have to face the _exact_ same issues now being faced by the labels in a year or two.<p>

It's not hard to imagine the development of a new product that's a step above a trailer. You'll go to Canter's or Beal's Media Bar (ooops dating myself here :-) and watch five or so of these for $5. Distribution is entirely digital.<p>

Best.<p>
