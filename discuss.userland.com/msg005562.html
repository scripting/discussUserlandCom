That's true, with Byte as the most obvious case in point. But I'd like us to try. If we succeed, there are all kinds of ways we can take it.<p>

<i>Some of this is simple bigotry, granted.</i><p>

Well, it's good-humored bigotry. More like partisanship, really.<p>

<i>But have you heard the popular Microsoft/Netscape phrase "eating your own dogfood"? The developers of Windows 2000 and Mozilla use the pre-release products for day-to-day tasks so that they have a real incentive to make things work. Many Linux companies will try to use Linux for the most unlikely of tasks. Quite frankly, the Linux desktop is still "dogfood"--we know this. But by trying to use it anyway, we lay pathways for less adventurous users.</i><p>

I do believe this is also the idea at SSC. If it <i>can</i> be done, even if in a clunky way, at least try to do it. Going with Mac or PC clients would be too easy. Also too hard to support &#151; a non-trivial concern.<p>

<i>Is CMYK useful to you without color correction?</i><p>

I don't know. I'll get back to you on it. As others already are, I see.<p>

Thanks!<p>
