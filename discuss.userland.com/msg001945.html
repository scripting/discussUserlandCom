The fact that it's public is a side-benefit, it ups the profile of the software distributed thru the site, within their company. <p>

That is totally fascinating to me.. It's something we have in common. I often find myself explaining things on Scripting News with the intention of raising it as a priority for my team. I've noticed that things become more real to them if they're out in public.<p>

I've been thinking of ways to increase this effect, including doing an IPO where the information about the company is disseminated thru Scripting News. If I were doing that, I'd bury the initial idea deep in the DG so I could see if people were receptive to the idea without being committed to it. A virtual toe-dip, if you will..
