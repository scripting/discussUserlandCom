My bad for not making that clear but it followed, I think, from the discussion in the MacWeek article so I didn't make the context as clear as I should have.<p>

It is true that Mozilla does have XML and CSS support but the browser currently isn't at a usable state, at least not for me due to problems with rendering plugins, so I don't think it fair to comment on it.<p>

Also, I think that the only reason that there is XMl and CSS support in Mozilla is becasue of the Open Source initiative. I don't think that the Netscape corporation would have been able to do it por would haev cared.<p>

As well part of the article also makes comments about the difference in support for Macintosh technologies and "look and feel". An area that Mozilla does not fare well in.<p>

I use Outlook Express on the Mac but I wouldn't ever use Outlook on the PC. Primarily for the security problems but also because of the UI and the usability of the program. OE on the PC is horrible and confusing to use. OE on the Mac is a very good app that scores very well for support of native Apple APIs and tecnologies. IE is the same.<p>

So for all the great XML and CSS code that is in Mozilla it still, at a certain point, comes down to usability and at the moment Mozilla doesn't even work or feel like a Mac application.
