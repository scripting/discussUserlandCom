CompuServe created the GIF spec, only to later discover that Unisys had a patent on the compression technique described in the spec.<p>

Just as there was nothing CompuServe could do about that, there's no way you can guarantee that XML-RPC doesn't infringe on some already-filed, but not-yet-issued patent application.<p>

Of course given how trivial XML-RPC is at its core (and I mean that as a high compliment, not a slight), it's unlikely to fall under any patents.
