There is a possibility for us to invite you here at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne, Germany, and maybe have a public session (Beamer and mike available, big projection screen). We have good facilities here and a room which can hold 50-60 people.<p>

I am interested - if you are as well, I'll have to negotiate for the resources.<p>

Cologne is not a bad place to visit in Germany and it is a 30 minute car ride to Bonn (where Andre is living?) - and it is quite in the center of Europe...<p>
