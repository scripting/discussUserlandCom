In a nutshell, combine storage and functionality server side with a rich lightweight interface client side.  Make the client configuration a url.  One file on the client, nothing to maintain.<p>

Since all your mail is on the server, multiple interfaces for location independant access to the same data are not that hard. (basic http, xmlrpc, imap, whatever)<p>
