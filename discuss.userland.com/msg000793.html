You'll be able to send parameters from Frontier to a script and get back a result. Frontier will execute the script by passing it to the Microsoft Script Control, a DLL they provide free from their Scripting site:<p>

<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/</a><p>

You'll be able to edit your VBScript scripts in a script editor window if you want -- but at least at first you'll need to call a glue script to execute these scripts, rather than call a script directly. The syntax will be somewhat like the callScript verb.<p>

I think this will be very powerful -- rather than try to build a complete set of COM client verbs in Frontier's kernel, it's better to connect to the platform's already well-developed COM scripting languages.
