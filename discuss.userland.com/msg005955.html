I put it in an old beater 5x86, 32 MB RAM, 6.4GB HD, generic (cheap!) 4mb video (S3 chip), IDE CD drive, generic 14" monitor.<p>

It took 20 minutes or so, and went flawlessly. The RH install detected my hardware perfectly; X Windows worked fine. I compiled and installed PHP, Apache, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.<p>

Then I upgraded via FTP to 6.0. Although it took several hours (via T-1), it too went flawlessly.  And didn't affect any of my other apps that I had previously installed.<p>

The moral: Just Do It. I agree with Eric.
