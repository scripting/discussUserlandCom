May I request that it be made as seamless as possible for those of us who move between a corporate (behind firewall) net and other (non-firewall) nets?  <p>

There are some apps that "use the browser's proxy" and can therefore tell (on my laptop with IE, anyway) if I'm at the office or at home.  This is <i>a good thing</i>, something a laptop user like myself thinks should be in every app.<p>

Others can't - the need to visit tools|options|proxies each morning and evening can be annoying.<p>

Future enhancement, perhaps, but please consider it.<p>
