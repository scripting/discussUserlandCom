Mail clients suck too.  I had a meltdown on my NT machine last week, and thought it would be a good time to try another mail client - they're all tying to be browsers!  
I had to spend 1/2 hour on all of them trying to figure out how to send plain text, get the right .sig, muck with cumbersome filters/rules, etc.  And then they still aren't very good (especially if you get 125+ messages or more a day - they seem to collapse under the weight).<p>

I gave up.  I use elm now.  On my Mac, I have outlook express - which actually isn't bad (way better than outlook for windows - I lasted about 10 minutes with that pig.)<p>

Nobody seems to be happy with being very good at one thing - they all have to be mediocre at everything, just so that they can say they have the feature sets.  I just want a program that will read HTML that's written according to sstandards and present me with the rendered page.  I don't need instant messaging, chat, news groups and mail in the same package.<p>

Notice that Ferrari does not advertise the towing capacity of their cars.  You want to tow?  Buy a Lincoln.;)
