The responder is pretty simple. Inside a loop, it reads the top file from the playlist into a string, then sends chunks of the string out using webserver.sendPartial until the string is empty. It then deletes the top line of  outline and then repeats the loop. <p>

Oh, and the responder can also work with tables, so XML should also be easy to support.<p>

As far as how this works, it is important to remember that this is a server, not a player. Your player, WinAmp?, would be listening to the stream. All your script would have to do is to replace the current playlist with your list of 5 songs. Seems to me that you could do this with XML-RPC or a web interface.<p>

I will try to work on the interface a little so it isn't faceless.
