Obviously there is a restriction of 256 characters max. in path in Windows.<p>

But this could be easily managed by anyone ho knows the basics of using personnal computers.<p>

The text file describing the URL, could be named by the title of the URL (Title of the URL.txt), and it could have inside anything we want for its description:<p>

<Author></Author><p>

<Country></Country><p>

<Description></Description><p>

...<p>

Then all html pages could be generated using any scripting language.<p>

What do you think ?<p>
