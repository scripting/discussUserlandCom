The performance issue is certainly there, but it's pretty acceptable.  In my ASP XML-RPC component, I do this on NT IIS on a low end machine (albeit with a pretty fast connection) and the performance is good. see <a href="http://www.wc.cc.va.us/frontierims/xml/rpc.asp">http://www.wc.cc.va.us/frontierims/xml/rpc.asp</a><p>

Also, it's probably better for a server to be making those calls than for a client to be making multiple calls, because the client's connection is generally not going to be as good as the server's.  The work get's done by the machine with the better connection.<p>
