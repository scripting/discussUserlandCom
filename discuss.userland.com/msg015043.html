Glad to hear it!<p>

Please bang on the scripts, there may be some bugs or incompatibilities. We didn't get a lot of feedback in the testing process, so we're concerned. Let's get these right asap. We have applications waiting for these verbs as well.<p>

Also, a reminder, don't thank me for these. Most of the work was done by Alan German, and Andre Radke is working on this stuff now. As always, it's a team effort.
