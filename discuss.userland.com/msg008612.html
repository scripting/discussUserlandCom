These are illegal no matter what the venue, and are not specifically banned because they're offing stock.<p>

Moreover, any offering of more than a certain amount, to more than a certain number of people (depending on the state, and whether the stock is being offered across state lines) must be registered with the appropriate authorities.  A chain-mail stock offering would violate these guidelines in any number of ways.<p>

Offering stock for services rendered, so long as the appropriate legalisms are heeded, is a regular and common occurance.  Many startup firms offer free stock to lawyers, etc. for services rendered.  There's no reason why offering stock for services should be illegal: if this were the case, how do you explain executive stock options?
