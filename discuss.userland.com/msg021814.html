Dave, I think you should do what you want to do most. Happily, what you have said you want to do most is also what I want you to do most! Make great knock-the-socks-off-'em software! <p>

Here's an idea, leave <a href="http://discuss.userland.com">http://discuss.userland.com</a> to your filter group or leave it entirely. Spend your time at <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/">http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/</a> or <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/">http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/</a>. That's where the action is and the rules are pretty clear and usually abided by too!<p>

On the days when you take a peak at <a href="http://discuss.userland.com">http://discuss.userland.com</a> and something really get under your skin, check this page out <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/17">http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/17</a> , the last entry. A plug from Dave Winer is a <i>very cool thing</i>. <p>

Have a <i>veeeery good day</i>.
