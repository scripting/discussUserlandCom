I'm a little perplexed why it doesn't think 'double' is a data type. In comparing it with the sample response at <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/rpc.html">http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/rpc.html</a>, it looks to me like a valid response.<p>

Yes, that's a bug.  The Perl module was originally written before <double> and <dateTime.iso8601> were defined :-).<p>

In Frontier/RPC2.pm, there is a hash called %scalars that lists the scalars that Frontier::RPC will support.  Add boolean, double, and dateTime.iso8601 and that should fix it until the next version.
