My father died from a stroke before the family's eyes back in 1955. I was five years old at the time. Not only didn't I understand what was happening to him, I didn't have a chance to say goodbye. Much of that recollection is still vivid in my mind today.<p>

My mother just passed away in January at age 83. I had a lot of time in the years before her death to talk to her, hold her, and express my love for her.<p>

I can't say which way of losing a parent is better. Both are painful for the loss.<p>

Bill Moyer's KPBS documentary explored many of the feelings I felt. I think there are many people who watched and are reflecting upon the show today and shall occasionally do so in the future.<p>

Thanks for listening too.<p>
