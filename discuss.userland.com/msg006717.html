Now more than ever I wish Microsoft would improve the text editor built into MSIE. I've tried to explain this to them so many different ways. Here's the straight poop. The editor sucks. If you want to see what I mean, get a <a href="http://www.hotmail.com/">HotMail</a> account and use it write all your email for a couple of days. You'll hate it. Make it so you don't.<p>

I just got interviewed by <a href="http://www.salon.com/">Salon</a> re Manila!<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$6748">Why is</a> it called Manila?<p>

<a href="http://www.publish.com/reviews/9906/reviews-2.html">Publish reviews</a> PhotoScripter 1.0, which adds scripting to Adobe PhotoShop/Mac. "But my biggest beef with PhotoScripter is its pricing. A single-user license is $299, while a workstation license (which allows the plug-in to be placed on a server and accessed by up to ten people) is $999." <p>

Huh? $299 is a bargain! There's a huge need for this product, and Adobe has been unresponsive for <i>eight years!</i> What's the reviewer's reasoning? He doesn't say. That people's time is worthless? Scripting PhotoShop has been on the professional's wish list for eight years. Now an independent developer has delivered. They should have a parade for MainEvent instead of complaining about, of all things, the price! <i>What do PhotoShop professionals earn?</i><p>
