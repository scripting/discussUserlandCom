I'm not sure what a sub-editor is, but since you offered to help..<p>

Please, if you can, point me to a product website, or several, that work for your management. Also, it would be helpful to know what about Frontier is impossible to duplicate. These might offer some clues for how we can present our product to make it more acceptable to the people you (and others) work for.<p>

Thanks!
