Dave, for you, I agree that's probably the case. For me, I'm unfamiliar with Eric's code, so <b>I</b> would treat that as the riskiest part. I'm not trying to put down his code. I'm just trying to explain how I would approach the problem. It's an unknown to me, so I'd rather get familiar with it quickly in case there was a problem (possibly with my understanding, and not with the code).<p>

<i>I think this is one of those cases where there's not a great upside in developing it in Frontier.</i><p>

I'm not sure I agree with you there. I did a project where I wanted to create a prototype and get a feel for the problem. I prototyped in Frontier, and discovered things I hadn't thought of. The shipping code ended up being written in C/C++, but by building a version in Frontier, I got something put together quickly, and had a pretty good idea of how the pieces were going to fit together before I started coding in C++. Where someone using a more formal methodology might've spent the same time building <a href="http://www.rational.com/uml/index.jtmpl">UML</a>, I pounded it out in UserTalk. In previous lives I prototyped in Basic or HyperCard.<p>

Also, it may turn out that development in Frontier will be good enough (perhaps not for the customer you mentioned in the original message, but good enough for other customers -- it would probably be good enough for me). In that case, you ship the prototype.<p>

<i>I've done a fair amount of email scripting in past lives.</i><p>

I figured you could probably come up with an answer, but since you were asking for opinions.... Personally, I don't have a good enough idea what an XML-RPC interface for email would look like yet, so I would <b>need</b> the iterations.<p>
