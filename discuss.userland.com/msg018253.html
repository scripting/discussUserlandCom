Talking with Brad Pettit on the phone yesterday.<p>

He said that perhaps we had wasted a lot of work in the 80s on doing wizzy software that fits into small memory spaces.<p>

I thought he had a good point. He said it would have been better if we had spent more effort working on text tools.<p>

Now this is interesting because Brad has spent almost as much time as I have working on outliners.<p>

So there's the other side. All the tools vendors look at XML and see Microsoft Word. I look at XML and see an outliner. That's the difference.<p>

If you design the data packet around a tool that makes it easy to manage and browse hierarchies, that makes all the concepts that W3C is exploring just come together. All of a sudden it gets small.
