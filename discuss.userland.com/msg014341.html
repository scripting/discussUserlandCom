Using their betas is always fraught with danger.<p>

While I've never had severe problems with MS betaware, a friend who is a huge fan of MS and their products has, and even he won't install their beta stuff on his production machine anymore, because too often he's experienced what you have.<p>

The only solution is usually to reformat your hdd and reinstall NT and everything else.<p>

If you can afford it, only use their beta stuff on a spare machine, never on your day-to-day box.<p>

While someone might come up with a solution, if you want to be productive quickly, you might have to do as I suggest above. :(<p>

I don't envy you. And from what I'd read of the 5.5 beta, I've stayed away. I'm too tired of reinstalling NT.
