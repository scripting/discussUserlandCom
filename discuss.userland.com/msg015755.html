One of the Manilapalooza in-jokes was how little Dave sleeps. Everyone seemed to recall seeing posts or getting instant email replies in the wee hours of the morning. Which raises a few questions for a future Davenet...<p>

- What are your secrets to time management?
- How do you avoid burnout in yourself and others?
- How many days of real vacation have you taken in the last three years? Enough/too much? 
- Do you think you are typical of other entrepreneurs at a similar stage in your career/business?  
- Sustaining a dialog with your public is stressful; suggestions for coping? <p>

Self management is one of those competencies implied in school but rarely taught. Your observations and feeback might be both useful and interesting. <p>

In the mean time, shluft gezundt. <p>
