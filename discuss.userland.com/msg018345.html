I feel that these are some of the most important pieces I've written. <br><br>	Along the way I became part of another community, that I have not directly written about. This evening I wrote an <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$849">introduction</a> to a talk by Jeru, the teacher of that community. Please read the intro first, there's a link to his story at the end. <br><br><b>Morning pointers<a name="morningPointers">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/06#morningPointers" title="Permanent link to 'Morning pointers' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Today's song: <a href="http://www.summer.com.br/~pfilho/html/lyrics/e/everybody_have_fun_tonight.txt">Everybody Have Fun Tonight</a>.

The bad news is that I still didn't get out, and the chances were looking pretty bad for the 4PM flight, and all that airport time put me in a foul mood along with a few thousand other people, so I headed back to work, and I'll do the Seattle trip later.
