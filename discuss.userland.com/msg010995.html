Important things are implementation of the target attribute into the #glosspatch mechanism, relative link management of <FRAME> tags (glossFrame?), management of the pageheader and pagefooter macros to take <NOFRAMES> into account. <p>

There is a remarkable dearth of informatin on this topic. A while back, it wouldn't have mattered, but now it does. A bunch of us are collaborating on generating not only a multiperson authored dynamic website - but the site itself is hosted on multiple servers at multiple locations. The best way to enable separate managers without making any one server the "uber-site" is FRAMES. <p>

Any information would be avidly read (and greatly appreciated). I'll let you know if I actually end up writing new tools for this.
