Netscape has had this since the early 4.x series, and was actually one of the few reasons that I liked netscape at the time. <p>

Unfortunately, other portions of netscape's cookie handling are substandard.<p>

Of course, ie 4, 4.5 and 5 for the mac forget that I've declined cookies for a domain if I edit any of the cookie settings. (like deleting a totally unrelated cookie)<p>
