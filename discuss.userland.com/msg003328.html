NONE OF THEM WORK</i><p>

Exactly, which is kind of what I thought we're working toward changing here, but leaving the trail of electrons behind for future review, too. ;-) We're looking for a method of making groups of folks more productive in ways that the currently available tools do not allow. <p>

<i>I'm tired of hearing about Magic Whiteboards. If they don't do expand/collapse and support easy understandable reorganization, then they are worthless in this context. Thanks for listening.</i><p>

We're on the same page here, Dave. <p>

I tried to use the mWB story as a method to get at how we might want the participants of a meeting to be able to interact with each other's ideas using this potential system. I guess my poor attempt to use it as a metaphor underscores the difficulty of this task we're taking on here.<p>

The outliner does things that a physical whiteboard just can't, and it makes a huge difference in productivity -- how often I've wished for cut/paste or the ability to look at an earlier version of something that has been erased or changed. <p>

At the same time, there are some things that most outliners don't allow (and I hope this changes real soon) -- e.g., including pictures, 
sound, and other media types.<p>

There is also another huge part involved here, that Bernie and some others have hinted at in this and related threads: not JUST the results of a meeting, but also a record of how those results came to be. A record of the conversations and shared understanding that it takes to arrive at that consensus.<p>

Knowing what went into a decision being made can be very valuable for folks involved in a project who may not have been at the meeting, or who were but can't remember all the details. (I can think of a few consulting gigs where I'd have given an eye-tooth to know what went on when they were coming up with a particular decision.)
