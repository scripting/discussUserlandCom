I think it's easy and useful to work with, though there's a couple things I've been wanting to add:<BR>
<li>author
<li>date of the item
<li>category of item
<li>RSS doesn't allow HTML elements (unless you use a CDATA section)
<li>release date - as in, when can partners publish the story<p>

There are a couple solutions I can think of:<BR>
<li>extend the RSS format - it would work, but then there would be two copies of everything (one for RSS and one for the extended format)
<li>invent a new format - I'd like to avoid this if possible since RSS has 90% of what I need
<li>use another format - like XMLNews; but people seem to get scared when they look at the number of elements when comared to RSS.<p>

I'm curious to find out what others are doing to solve this problem?
Any ideas?<p>

Jonathan.
