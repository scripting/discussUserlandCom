The issue is that with NT4, sp4, and large font sizes selected in the display control panel, outlines initially display in a point size about three sizes too small, e.g. 7 pt when 10pt is the correct size. When the cursor is placed in linetext, in a bar type cursor, the font jumps to the correct size.  There are also some issues that occur when the font is that thick fixed size font that is only in one point size.<p>

I'm not in front of my nt machine now, (I can get screen shots on sunday if you like) so I can't get the exact conditions where it happens, but there are also times that the headlines get the right size, but the line height is appropriate for the font size that is three pt smaller. <p>

These effects couple to make outline editing (and by extension script editing) somewhat frustrating. It was worse before the latest beta, bad enough that editing on that machine was 2 to 4 times less productive than working in 5.16.<p>

These effects have shown up with 2 different video cards, so I doubt that it's a driver thing. (Diamond Fire 1000 gl, and Matrox Millenia)  It does go away when small fonts are selected in the display control panel. For my machine that is not an acceptable solution, since I need the resolution for things other than text and small text at that resolution is pretty much illegible. <p>
