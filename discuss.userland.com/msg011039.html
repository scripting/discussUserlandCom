Let's do it, you don't have to do it on your own. We're going to roll out a new Support-Associates program in the next couple of days and it will give people incentives to help each other, to invest in each other. This would be a very nice community project. A proxy server with a built-in content management system. Now I bet I could find a use for that!<p>

Thanks very much for posting this.
