So I thought I would just try out the functionality by using some of the GNOME icons I had lying around.  They were done by Tigert (<a href="mailto:tigert@gimp.org">tigert@gimp.org</a>) and released under the GPL.  So unfortunately I can't re-release them because Radio Userland is not a GPL application.<p>

However I can legally use them on my own machine.  So I thought I could at least provide some eye candy.<p>

Here is a link to the <a href="http://isangelos.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$27">larger shot.</a><p>

enjoy.<p>
