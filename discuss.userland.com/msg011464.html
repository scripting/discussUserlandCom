What is Armed Linux?<p>

Armed Linux is a new Linux distribution meant for first time users and people who need Linux as a secondary operating system. A small group of developers and users, we believe in Linux and want to see it flourish. We also understand that in today's market Microsoft has a monopoly on the desktop operating system. The reality is that it is difficult to do without a Microsoft product on your system. Many people would rather run something else; something stable and able to be customized. To fill the hole we have developed Armed Linux.<p>

Our Design Statement<p>

To develop a version of Linux for the first time user; to be a guilt free, easily reversed, non-destructive distribution that co-exists with existing Microsoft operating systems.<p>
