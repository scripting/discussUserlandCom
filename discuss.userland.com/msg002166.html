Testing: is the following character a percent sign? [Percent]25<p>

Testing: is the following character a plus sign? [Percent]2B<p>

If I was write, the [Percent]25 would be converted to a Percent sign by the string.urlDecode call, and [Percent]2B would be converted to a Plus sign.<p>

(Of course, I didn't type [Percent], I typed the real percent character, Shift-5)<p>
