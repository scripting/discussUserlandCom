I've seen a couple of examples in the discuss.root that I downloaded when the enclosures were first done (1/23/98  was that really only a month ago???) but I'm not sure if the examples that I have constitute a specification.<p>

Looking through mainresponder.discuss doesn't show any putEnclosure type of function, and there doesn't seem to be a way to do it through addMessage.<p>

I could go into the message table and just twiddle entries, but with things like this, I'd rather go through a real interface that is less likely to change on me.<p>
