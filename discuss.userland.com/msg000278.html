Here's what's not working on my machine.<p>

When I go to a site with frames and want to point to a page inside the site, I have to get the URL from the Properties window. Right-click on the text and choose Properties. Then a window pops up containing information, including the URL of the page I'm looking at. Select the URL, copy, switch into Frontier, paste. It's an almost essential part of my workflow.<p>

But the feature appears to be broken in beta 2. The clipboard does not contain the URL when I switch back into Frontier. It's not just a problem with Frontier, I tried to paste into Eudora too, with no luck. The problem seems to be in MSIE.<p><p>Running NT4, Service pack 3.<p>
