The pod is basically a DHCP hub. What is amazing about this is not the price and performance (which are very good) but the fact that Apple just usurped an existing market, made it standard and put the 'iMac ease of use' seal of approval on it - just as they did with USB.<p>

It's a consumer-level service now - no more worrying about standards, wondering if things will be compatible, etc.<p>

3rd parties will put this all over the place... The /. boys will love shoving linux on this!
