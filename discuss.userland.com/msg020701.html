It is a product, cards, games, etc.  People buy it.  <p>

My roomate likes Pokemon.  However, to my knowledge, he has never bought anything Pokemon related.  He simply downloaded the Gameboy Emulator and plays the hacked Pokemon Game ROM for it.  He also watches the TV show.  <p>

I personally find Pokemon stupid. :-)
