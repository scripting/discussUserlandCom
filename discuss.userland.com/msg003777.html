Seems to me that this would make it a bit more self-docimenting, and might save a few newbie questions in future.<p>

Also, is extraInfo an address or an object? Defaulting to nil implies an address (to me anyway). If I'm passing a table in extraInfo, wouldn't passing the address be more efficient? Maybe it should be adrExtraInfo or adrCallbackData?<p>

Sorry if this seems like a nitpick.
