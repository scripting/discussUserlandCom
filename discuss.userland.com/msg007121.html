These directives could be set on a per-table or even a per-page basis, allowing you to customize the layout of the navbar as needed. Would that work for you? </i><p>

It would work fine for me, but what I meant earlier is that <i>some authors might want to use mutliple formats within a single page</i>.<p>

Having used this method (directive based formatting) for several months in my own macros, I have not yet found a situation where I need more control than directives provide.<p>

Actually, I do remember one instance: a macro that built fairly complex tables. When I ended up with two or more tables on a page, I had to move the formatting options from directives to parameters.<p>

I'm not sure if this limitation might come up for anyone using navBar.
