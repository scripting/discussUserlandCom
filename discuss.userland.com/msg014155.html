The HTML control is <i>sitting in my System Folder right now!</i> (And it's even IE5.) Look! <a href="http://www.concentric.net/~gorskic/images/ie5control.jpg">I'm using it right now.</a> See? I'm not crazy, am I?<p>

Why do I need to talk to Apple? It's not their control.<p>

Eudora and Microsoft use it. Why can't one of Microsoft's thousands of engineers post a document saying how to use it?<p>

Or maybe I'm just dense.<p>

P.S. Since IE (and maybe even OE) comes preinstalled on every Mac, it would stand to reason that <a href="http://www.concentric.net/~gorskic/images/itsreallythere.jpg">the control is already installed on every Mac.</a> Or maybe I'm just dense. Funny how that keeps coming up...<p>

P.P.S. Remember that episode of M*A*S*H where Frank Burns ordered the camp to move across the road on the grounds that it is a mobile hospital? I'm beginning to think Frank Burns really exists and lives in Silicon Valley.
