There is a perfectly fine implementation of CORBA (ACE) and an orb (TAO) free for *COMMERCIAL* use on a BUNCH of platforms:<p>

SOAP does not seem to compare to CORBA any more than Volvo compares Greyhound.  Not every problem is suited to Visual Basic and web servers.  By the time SOAP could be used to solve the same class of problems as CORBA, it would have just as many services!  <p>

CORBA is not going to go away.  Take a look at some of the companies using TAO on big technical problems.
