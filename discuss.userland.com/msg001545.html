You're right. I tried it today. Doesn't work. Btw, DDE works just fine for me if I uncheck "Browse in a new process" and that fixes another bug too: session cookies are not shared between windows if they "browse in a new process", so if I pop up a window in the client there's no way for the server to tell if that's the same person. Took a *long* time to figure out...<p>

"About Frontier as a COM client -- what do you think of the idea of running VBScript, JScript, and PerlScript scripts in Frontier? These languages are built for COM."<p>

Sounds good to me. But why not make Frontier an ActiveX-compatible (or whatever it's called) scripting language that can be plugged in wherever JScript/VBScript can be? Such as in IIS/ASP. I'd rather have Frontier everywhere than VBScript in Frontier.<p>
