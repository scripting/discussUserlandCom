When the site grovs - and DG & mainResponder makes it easy to spread responsibility for making new pages - a rising number of freak links occur.<p>

Like on <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/tcp/sendMail">http://docserver.userland.com/tcp/sendMail</a> where the phrase "Let's Have Fun!" in  <i>Examples	tcp.sendMail ("dave@userland.com", "Hello!", "Let's Have Fun!")</i> has becomed automaticly linked. <p>

I know there is at least two solutions for this.<p>

<ul>
<li>Escaping the quotes by putting a backslash before them. But if the 'linked to'-page is made after my page, the risk is big that it will be there for quite some time before I discover the freak link. Also, I find it a bit 'Microsoft Word' to be forced to take extra messures so that the automatic helper will not mess up my text.</li>
<li><p>There is a #directive to shut it of. But I like the ease of it, I would just wish the mechanism to be triggered by something a bit less common than just quoting a phrase.</p></li>
</ul><p>
