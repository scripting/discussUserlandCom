This experiment is like that. XML-RPC is and always will be a creature of HTTP. But what about the payload format, could it be transported through other protocols? <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1401">Of course it can</a>. So today I boldly went where no one has gone before and started doing RPC across SMTP.<br><br>Mac OS X buzz.

He agreed that WSDL will not be part of interop for SOAP 1.1, and that we will not ask for or use WSDL in any way as part of the interop tests. We will use English <a href="http://soap.weblogs.com/validator1">docs</a> and <a href="http://validator.soapware.org/readFromCache$00039737">examples</a>, in the way UserLand's <a href="http://validator.soapware.org/">validator</a> does. He says that Microsoft's SOAP implementations <i>all</i> do RPC. He agrees that RPC will be the basis for validation. This is good. On the other hand, if it requires agreement with a representative of Microsoft to decide what interop means, then SOAP is not an Internet standard, it's a way to interop with Microsoft. To my fellow developers, please let's work together. It's the only way our work will be meaningful, imho. In the <a href="http://www.soapware.org/interopathonPlan">Interopathon</a> plan, I called for a lot of things we seem to agree on. Public servers, hierarchic pairing of developers to create interop, and a conclusion to the process where we can say definitively that we all interop. Even though I withdrew as the Designated Hardass of that project, the plan remains and can be used, in part or in whole.<br><br><a href="http://dss.editthispage.com/2001/03/24">David Singer</a>: "Well, it's spring, and I'm in Paris."<br><br>Pat Thoyts: <a href="http://www.zsplat.freeserve.co.uk/soap/doc/TclSOAP.html">SOAP for Tcl</a>.<br><br><a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$7229#7235">David Brown</a> compares Frontier and Zope.<br><br><a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1389?mode=day">David also comments</a> on my SOAP Journal.
