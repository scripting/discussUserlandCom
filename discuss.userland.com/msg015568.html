In answer to your question Wes, I think Apple's rendering library is mostly HTML 3.2 with some extensions for AppleScript and Apple Guide (at least in the Help Viewer).  Certainly Apple shouldn't get into the business of trying to do CSS/JavaScript/etc, unless they want to throw a developer or two at the Mozilla project.<p>

Another interesting note:  It's possible to embed MSIE's engine into other apps, just like Outlook Express on Mac does.  There was a hack a few years ago that did this with [insert yet another dead Apple technology here].  I really doubt this is documented or supported, though.
