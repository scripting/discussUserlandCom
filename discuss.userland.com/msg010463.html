Let's say Dave gives permission to copy all forum posts. I post with the understanding that I'm talking to a specific community, and don't want my posts taken out of context elsewhere. I get mad. Or, supppose Dave says nobody can copy forum posts. I want my wisdom dispersed far and wide. Again a mismatch, though I'm not likely to get mad in this case, I can just post somewhere else in addition if I think my words are that important.<p>

In other words, a forum owner should make his policy available to anyone who might want to post on the forum. <p>

Speaking hypothetically, it could get even stranger. Say, for example, that some public forum won't let anyone scrape their site. Then all their participants post a tagline: "This post placed in the public domain by the author"...
