Of those 27k bytes of Visicalc, how many could be removed or changed before it ceases to be "Visicalc?" Same with Frontier. Now, consider that a 20MB song file on a music CD can become a 5MB, 3MB, or even a 1MB or smaller file, all the while still able to recreate the sounds identifiable as <a href="http://umgawa.bands.uiuc.edu/MI/Sounds/1996/walkin_sunshine.mp3">"Walkin' on Sunshine."</a> <em>Hey, that song seems to appear everywhere else...</em> There is so much non-essential data in the highest-quality recordings, but a comparative listening will show you how important those <em>non-essential</em> bytes may be.
