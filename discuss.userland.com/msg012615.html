I did straighten htmlInterfaces.root.newsStoryDG.#prefs.defaultMembershipGroup and htmlInterfaces.root.newsStoryDG.edit.#members out.<p>

The real stumbling block was that I had put a #urls in [htmlInterfaces.root].logon to try to make it apply specifically to my discussion groups. This caused a problem when I followed Mike Mell's procedure reported in a Script Meridian Community list email titled "Re: membership woth mainResponder" sent 13 Sep 1999.<p>

His good advice was to move a copy of [htmlInterfaces.root].logon into [htmlInterfaces.root].newsStoryDG and rename it public and to change the urls copied into [htmlInterfaces.root].newsStoryDG.#urls from config.<p>

My mistake was not to remove the #urls that earlier I had copied into logon. So I had TWO #urls and the original took precedence over the modified ones at the top level of newsStoryDG.<p>

Mike Mell's procedure as reported by Ken Dow follows:
> Well, well well. Here is what I did to give myself and others secure access to a gdb in mainResponder.<p>

> 1. copy [htmlInterfaces.root].logon to the top level of mySite. (by top level, I mean at the same level as mySite.#ftpSite)<p>

> 2. rename mySite.logon to "public" <a href="//">//</a> the magic name<p>

> 3. copied [config.root].mainResponder.urls to the top level of my site.<p>

> 4. renamed urls to #urls<p>

> 5. adjusted all the urls paths to "http://mydomain.com/mySite/public" except for memberHome which became "http://mydomain.com/mySite/" <a href="//">//</a> left off "public"<p>

> 6. rebuilt the public.#glossary deleted public.#ftpSite<p>

> 7. added mySite.#members (string) == "mySite" to the top level of the site<p>

> 8. duplicated [members.root].default<p>

> 9. renamed [members.root].default #1 to "mySite"<p>

> 10. edited [members.root].mySite: [members.root].mySite.mailTemplate to contain the url of the site home page<p>

[members.root].mySite.cookieName == "mySite"<p>

[members.root].mySite.mailReturnAddress == <a href="mailto:mike@nthwave.net">mike@nthwave.net</a><p>

> I believe these are the complete and precise steps required for this will work for anyone. <p>

> Next, I want to provide access for four know people:<p>

> 1. I went to the sign up page <a href="http://myDomain.com/mySite/public/signup">http://myDomain.com/mySite/public/signup</a><p>

> 2. entered their email address. Repeat for each one<p>

> 3. set [members.root].mySite.openToPublic to false. No more new sign ups are allowed.<p>
