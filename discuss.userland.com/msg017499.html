If you have a kitSuite.root which contains your kitSuite table, you can call your script like this:<p>

kitSuite.Scripts.mEudora.zeroWindow ()<p>

You may want to think about where you've placed scripts in your suite. I don't know what your table structure looks like, but you can move commonly used scripts up a level or two, to make them even easier to call.
