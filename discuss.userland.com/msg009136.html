Jerry Pournelle, in one of his BYTE columns turned me on to ThinkTank. <p>

I used an Apple <a href="http://e/">//e</a> with ThinkTank at home and I bought a <a href="http://c/">//c</a> to use ThinkTank at work! It was the coolest organizing tool I had ever seen, there was absolutely nothing like it ever before. I kept our command schedule on it, tracked projects with it, drafted instructions and notices on it. <p>

And it was S L O W!<p>

It ran on the Apple Pascal p-system, so you had to have two disk drives to use the thing and it went to the disk alot as I recall. But it didn't matter how slow it was because it was the only tool that did what it did.<p>

I can't wait for the release, I'll run it on a <a href="http://e/">//e</a> emulator on my PM 6500 and it ought to be really snappy. It'll be fun just to play around with it.<p>

I'm looking forward to grabbing More 3.0 when I get home. 1.1c was giving me fatal errors when I tried it last night, hopefully 3.0 will run better. But 1.1c is going to make it to my Duo 280 which is running 7.5.5 where it's likely to be a little more comfortable.<p>

I use WebArranger from CE Software (formerly Arrange from Common Knowledge, now a dead product) as my current organizer which is a database in an outline format, kind of like Frontier I guess.<p>

Now, in good conscience, I'm simply going to have to go buy a copy of Inspiration, because I believe they are the last surviving outline application developer for the Mac (excluding Frontier) and I can't imagine they're jumping for joy over the More 3.0 release. I'm having a few copies purchased for my office in the Windows flavor, because I want to introduce some of my people to thinking using an outliner and Word's implementation is simply too cumbersome, though it is usable once you've configured it properly.<p>

Thanks Dave and Symantec. This software deserves a chance to be seen and appreciated again.<p>
