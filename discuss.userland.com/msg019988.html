Yes. The Free Software Foundation actually uses two <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">copyleft</a> licenses: the GPL and the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</a>. (The second license used to be called the "Library General Public License", but Stallman changed the name to the "Lesser General Public License".)<p>

The LGPL addresses most of the concerns you mention.<p>

But I've also been trying to keep this discussion philosophical, and to stay out of the mind-numbing details of license politics. ;-)<p>

(If your company is releasing code, however, I'd be happy to talk to your corporate counsel. Quite frankly, the whole open source licensing situation is one big, festering swamp of legalese.)<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
