It's not just images, it's ANY self-referential link on the home page.  So, my link today to the referrers functionality also is munged by My.Userland.<p>

Nonetheless, I don't have to accept that My.Userland will munge them, since the XML that it's parsing is XML generated by my machine.  So I can just edit my getScriptingNewsXML script, or just put a new one in my #tools table and change the xml/scriptingNewsXML object from a script which calls the officially-sanctioned Userland one to a call to my version.  This is what I've done for the fix that <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14046">I just documented on Discuss</a> for a ling tag case requirement that was being enforced by the getScriptingNewsXML that didn't need to be there.<p>
