I dunno. I have a lot of mind space invested in Perl, and don't really like TCL (which I'm having to learn so I can develop in Story Server). AOLServer's dependency on TCL is the big turn off for me.<p>

Thought about usability: Unix is famously difficult because it was created by programmers for programmers. Perhaps that is a genuine tendency in most open source software - it's always started and worked on by people who differ from normal users in many ways, and who are focussed on serving their own needs, not those of "normal" users.
