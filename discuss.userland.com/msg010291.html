The example uses an address to index into a string. Why do that? Why not simply use the string value and index into that? I'm basically confused as to when and why you want to use address variables.</i><p>

One common use for address variables: <p>

By passing addresses between scripts (or storing addresses in locations which are accessible to scripts), it's possible to pass data between scripts without having to copy it. Instead, an address <b>pointing</b> to the data is used.<p>

For example, if I write a macro which manipulates information about a particular page, that macro might call another script or verb which also deals with the same page. Instead of sending a copy of the page in question, I would typically want to send the other script the address of the page.<p>

Addresses are used very frequently in the websisite framework. If you examine the HTML verbs, you'll find that many of them accept addresses as a parameter.
