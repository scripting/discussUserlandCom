If I go back to a previous news listing in the DG and change it on a date later than the posted date, it changes the date in the headline, and also seems to mess up the calendar. It seems that it is using the date modified field in the DG, not the date created. I guess this might be desirable in some situations, but in mine I found a typo in my news item from a couple of days ago, went back to fix and, then that date in dynamically generated newssite showed todays day in the headline.<p>

Will play with this some more this weekend.<p>
