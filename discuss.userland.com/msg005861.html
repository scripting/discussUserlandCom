I want to open, say, ten sites at once in their own windows. <p>

This works in Netscape:<p>

Netscape.openurl ("http://www.macintouch.com/", nil, false);<p>

Netscape.openurl ("http://macweek.zdnet.com/", nil, false);<p>

Netscape.openurl ("http://www.scripting.com/", nil, false)<p>

This works in IE:
Explorer.openurl ("http://www.macintouch.com/", nil, true);
Explorer.openurl ("http://macweek.zdnet.com/", nil, true);
Explorer.openurl ("http://www.scripting.com/", nil, true)<p>

Thanks<p>

PS I don't understand why these work, it was by trial and error. But I haven't succeeded with iCab. They did add openurl a release or two ago (I wrote them about it, don't know if that's why they added it or not)
