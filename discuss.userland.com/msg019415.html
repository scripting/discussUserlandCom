That means that 60% of the price goes back to the creator of the patterns, if $0.10 per pattern is representative. It also means that the profit margin is hair-thin, because the publisher needs to pay for printing, distribution, advertizing and overhead out of the remaining $2 or $3.<p>

Just a thought.
