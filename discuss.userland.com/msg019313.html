Indeed. But with companies abandoning CMS solutions like Vignette in favour of custom build applications, is this still a selling point  ?<p>

Nearly all of the software i have at home is pirate. But if i didn't have it how could i learn the skills that got be the job in IT companies where it is licensed ?
What software to I legitamately own ?
Well the stuff i couldn't get from warez sites and was cheap enough for me I *felt*  I could afford.  <p>

Would I legitamately buy a copy of Photoshop if it was &#163;60 instead of &#163;600. Damn right. 
Why isn't Photoshop on every computer in the world ?
What if it was the price of Tekkon 3 which would you buy for your kids ? <p>

Even at that price people would still be buying pirate copies, but how many new legitimate customers would you gain to offset the losses of the pirates. <p>

If other people don't think so, the solution is to not use the product.<p>

Fair enough. <p>

Last year I got my girlfriend to buy my copy of Frontier as shes a student and could get it for $100. I'm a former artist, now a HTML programmer and music promoter. I've never used it in a commercial capacitity and will probably never get to (programming, server administation at that level is a bit beyond me) though i share Daves vision of a community online. I loved the sound of the product and just wanted to tinker a bit with it. <p>

These days I think Manilla is more my level of aptitude. So I use my copy of Frontier as a personel web server and play around with that.  Creating, destroying, creating again. One day I'll built my dream website , and it'll be in Manilla.<p>

Do I regret my purchase ? Not for a moment. Dave makes great software. Its worth $900. Shame I just don't have that kind of money.<p>
