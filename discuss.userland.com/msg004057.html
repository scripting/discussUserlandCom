For my $.02, I think it's "wildly popular" for the same reasons that MS-DOS was wildly popular. People who didn't necessarily have a choice invested a large amount of time learning a difficult to use system, which resulted in a need to justify/defend that large intellectual investment. It self-propogates at that point.<p>

Unfortunately, that argues in favor of marketing difficult to use systems that require arcane knowledge. I guess I'll never understand...
