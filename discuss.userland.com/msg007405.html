Indeed there were several items in user.betty.queueOutgoing.table. 
I emptied the queue and it worked but when I post a response, it dumps things to the queue.  This is what tryError contains:<p>

"The server,... , return error code8: Can't index this page because the server does not accept public submissions."<p>

members.default.openToPublic is set to true. Did I miss something?<p>

Is this a server conflict because I have Frontier Web Server and another server (Web Site) are on the same machine and are running at the same time but different port??
