anyway, the advanced search is cool. i got to thinking about how i use scripting news. in addition to frontier-centric info, it's the links to everything else that i value. and i wish i could use the search engine to search specifically for links. or to list recent links, etc. i wouldn't use it in the same way i use altavista or other search engines. in this case, a web site i value talks about and links to other interesting sites/articles, etc. the links are more valueable because they have some editorial content, etc. if nirvana could facilitate that, well, i'd be a customer. although i will be soon enough anyway.
