An I-message describes the way *you* feel in response to someone else's statements or actions.  A you-message renders your personal evaluation of the other person's motivation, character, parentage, etc.<p>

You-messages frequently express cognitive distortions such as labelling the other person (which often degenerates into name-calling), mind-reading (stating your beliefs about the other person's motivation, when in fact you're only guessing at his/her motivation), overgeneralization, and "should" statements.  All of these tend to provoke defensive reactions, *even if you're completely in the right*.<p>

Example I-message: "I was taken aback by the intensity of your response.  I thought I had made it clear that I did *not* believe that a namespace URI should always point to a retrievable schema."<p>

Example you-message: "Try reading for comprehension, you idiot.  Quit pretending that I don't understand namespaces.  If you had taken the time to read what I was writing, I said that namespace URIs don't always have to point to schemas."
