for RSS feeds into DMOZ. That was in the original plan for RSS.<p>

My connection with DMOZ is very simple. I was instrumental in
Netscape acquiring Newhoo which then became dmoz. I was also
instrumental in getting netscape/aol to give the data away.
So, I know the dmoz creators well, I believe strongly in what
they are doing and help them whichever way I can. They are
also some of the best friends I have. I hope that clears things 
up.<p>

I wish you would stop refering to my "RDF Plans". I wish I had
some. Its a useful tool I use often. Beyond that, I don't have
any plans.<p>

If you need to put a face to RDF so that you can attack 
it, go pick someone else. Pick on W3C and TimBL --- 
he seems to be the most active and vocal proponent of RDF.<p>
