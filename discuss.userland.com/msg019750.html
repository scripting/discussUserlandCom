Browse through <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram.html">Bruce Schneier's newsletter</a> sometime. A good crypto algorithm doesn't depend on obscurity, it depends on lots of expert codebreakers banging on it over time without being able to break it, even though they know exactly how it works. Bruce argues strongly that the same is true of security protocols in general, and provides a lot of case studies.
