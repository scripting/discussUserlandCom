"For example, Dave and I discussed a model in which my.userland.com will provide a tree-viewing service for the namespace that is the union of all requests... Won't this get messy?"<p>

Library science long ago discovered that without "controlled vocabularies", efficient searches are almost impossible. There are already numerous controlled vocabularies out there (the LOC subject headings being the most obvious example). I confidently predict that if you pursue this approach, someone will be posting a message to this newsgroup around 2010 saying, "Look, this is ridiculous! some people are classifying pages under 'Cars of France', others under 'Automobiles - French', and still others under 'French Cars'. Let's get together and adopt a controlled vocabulary!"
