It's like having a nose that's out of joint. I guess it comes down to this, are we using an operating system or are we using a network? <p>

There are still things that the OS does better than the network. I'm also looking at the Explorer as a survey of the hierarchy-browsing world. I'm wondering if it makes sense to do a new piece of software that understands how to browse Internet hierarchies as the Windows Explorer manages hierarchies on the LAN.<p>

That's part of the reason why the timing of the re-exploration of old outliners is fortuitous. <p>

BTW, I like the Explorer. Once I got over its weirdness it even gets comfortable. I had never worked with a multi-paned outliner before. I kind of like it!
