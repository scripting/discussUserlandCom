"Upstreaming is the automatic movement of content off your workstation to a non-changing location that's publicly accessible."<br><br>I have four playlists in my upstreamed <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/sets/">folder</a>. Next step, linking between outlines. To get that process started, every user's directory needs a <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/directory.xml">directory</a> of the files it contains. <br><br>About firewalls. In general Radio UserLand <i>will not</i> work behind a firewall. We are not, with this product, working around firewalls in any way. That's a deliberate decision. Firewalls are designed to stop people from running servers. In 2000 that means you can't be part of a peer-to-peer community. <br><br><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19666">A patent story</a> so simple a child could understand why they are bad news for environments where people share ideas freely. <br><br><a href="http://release1.userland.com/">A really nice redesign</a> at Kevin Werbach's weblog companion to the Release 1.0 newsletter.<br><br>An amazing thing. Every Sting song I've never heard is a big hit with me. Today I'm digging <a href="http://stingetc.com/lyrics/brandnew.html">Brand New Day</a>. I've lived that. Been there.
