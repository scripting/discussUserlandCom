History tells us this :<p>

The US most always starts bombing raids on a new moon. 2 nights ago was not an exception. (FYI, Jan 17, the start of Desert Storm was also a new moon)<p>

The media tells us the UN inspectors were afraid that the weapons that the US in now bombing, would be moved.<p>

I've also read reports thet the US wanted to finish bombing before the Muslim holiday month, which starts on Sunday, I think.<p>

So, I think the bombing would have occurred even if the empeachment vote was not scheduled, and I think that Britian would not be involved if the only goal of this miltary action was to delay the Houses's vote.
