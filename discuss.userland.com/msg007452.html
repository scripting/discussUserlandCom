Some sites are highly structured. They break everything down into strict categories (news, book reviews, editorials, etc.) and every item of a certain type has exactly the same fields (headline, text, icon, author, etc.). These sites tend to devote a lot of vertical screen space to each item; thus it is a waste of space to have a short body. (Look at Slashdot for an example; each item uses up about 2 inches of space just for the meta-information.) To prevent the meta-information from drowning out the body, it has to be longer (usually several sentences). But now it's long enough that you can't skim it, so a headline is needed. So highly structured sites have separate headlines. RSS works for these sites.<p>

Other sites are unstructured (e.g. Scripting News, Hack The Planet, Robot Wisdom). Since there is only a blank line between items, I can post more, shorter items. I don't have to think about whether it's worth 5 inches of vertical space before posting something. It isn't practical for me to support RSS, because there is no automated way to tell what part is a "headline" and what isn't. I'm not willing to write separate headlines.
