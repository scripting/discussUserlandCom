This isn't a big deal for most users, but it is a known fact that the IP stack built into BSD is significantly superior to the Linux IP stack for server applications.</I><p>

I'd like to see evidence that this is still true for modern Linux and BSD systems. It was definitely true about five years ago, but I have not been able to measure any difference since Linux 2.0. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places.<p>

On the other hand, BSD's support for multiple processors and compiler tools has been catching up to Linux.<p>
