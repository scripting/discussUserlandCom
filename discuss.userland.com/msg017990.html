Were you able to get answers to some of these questions?<p>

I think others have already raised some of the issues surrounding Napster. Napster started as a utility to find MP3's online - and it did the job quite well. It's now a company and finding MP3's is no longer the issue of the day. Napster is going to have to innovate on how it can successfully bring together artists and consumers and make money for itself and the artists. This might mean changing the Napster product (hosting a lot of music on its servers, striking agreements with artists, etc). Good companies ask the right questions and innovate to come up to the right answers. Bad companies stick and hold tight to one product, regardless of the changing market conditions. I hope Napster views itself as a company and not as a product, and is working to solve the bigger problem, the one that the market needs solving - how can you change the music business and do a lot of good for the musician (and producer, engineer, song writer, etc), consumer and itself?<p>

BTW, some of you might be interested in the column on Upside today. It criticizes MP3.com for selling out to the record labels. <a href="http://www.upside.com/On_Trial/394eb47d0.html">http://www.upside.com/On_Trial/394eb47d0.html</a>
