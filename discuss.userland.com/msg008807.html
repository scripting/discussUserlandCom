Then hook into the overnight script loop by placing your script in
         config.mainresponder.callbacks.nightlyBackup.

I've <b>not</b> sent this message several times, but I guess I 
have no choice.  I can't "see" what is going on.<p>

I have a perfectly wonderful script that sends email to all members if 
there has been traffic during the day.  The script works like a champ 
when I do it manually, when I put it in an Every Hour or Minute 
schedule.  When I put it in Overnight, it doesn't work.  It doesn't 
work on two different systems.<p>

Ah.  Writing is thinking!  The script checks the messages during the 
day.  In the wee hours of the morning, there have been no 
messages so the script works, but nothing is sent.  Isn't that 
correct?  Easy solution is to have overnight task occur before 
midnight rather than after.  True?
