<i>As for multiple machines. I used 3 of them, I just set POP to leave the mail on the server for x days and eventually all three machines have all my mail. </i><p>

I use this method as well.  The only problem with this system is that out going mail can get out of sync unless you remember to cc: yourself on every message you write.<p>

(Furthermore, even if you do copy yourself on all out going mail this does not solve the problem, when composing a reply, of making sure responses remain in the same folder as the original message.)
