Unlike text, image appears in a web page is not the original document. It's the optimized product of the original. Quality has been sacrificed because of many reasons. Editing on an image that has already been optimized will generate a further degraded image. You should take a look at how Fireworks & Dreamweaver works. If you click on an image in Dreamweaver, Fireworks will launch and you will have a choice to open the source document instead of the optimized image.
