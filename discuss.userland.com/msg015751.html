Something like menusharing would be easily (?) implemented via the Services functionality in MacOS X. I'm not sure how the interface to it from Carbon (rather than Cocoa) would be, but the functionality is great. It allows you to create services which can be accessed from any Carbon/Cocoa application. The services are context sensitive, so the services which can operate on a given piece of data are available at that time.<p>
