<a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/">http://www.sparknotes.com/</a><p>

Which is basically an online version of  "cliff's notes" style summaries of classical stories.<p>

But what is interesting is that I thought about this in the context of editthispage.com sites.  Imagine if there were a site for each story? You could get the same functionality - and you could have multiple authors who contribute to the main "summary" or perhaps divide up the story into parts, and have say 5 people attach War and Peace and write summaries for thier specific part.<p>

This would make and interesing subgenre of manila sites: critiques and summaries of famous works - like artwork, books, music (play snippets online..) and have the discussion board there for students across universities to share info....
