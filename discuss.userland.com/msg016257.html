I was actually close to writing a Manila plug-in spell checker (I even threw the entire spell dictionary from my linux ispell app into a GDB as a starting point), but I couldn't grok how I could get Manila to use an intermediary step when posting a message.<p>

In other words, if I implemented it, I'd want the following functionality:<p>

<ol>
<li>User creates a new topic, or types in a reply to an existing topic;</li>
<li>User clicks on the "Post" button;</li>
<li>Spelling suite checks the spelling, and throws up a page that has the entire message, and any words that it doesn't know are highlighted, with a pulldown menu of possible replacements;</li>
<li>User goes through and makes all the changes that he or she wants to, and then clicks on the "Post" button;</li>
<li>Message is posted.</li>
</ol><p>

Right now, the Manila flow is 1 -> 2 -> 5 (in the above list); I couldn't figure out how to interpose 3 and 4.  Is it possible?  If so, I can whip something together soon...<p>
