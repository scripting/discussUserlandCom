<I>I stopped reading here: 'There's nothing unique about Amazon. It's easy to build a site that does what Amazon does, and only mildly challenging to do it better.'<p>

Are you serious?</I><p>

As a heart attack. The nice thing about a book site is that it poses no significant data-modelling issues because books have been uniquely identified by ISBN essentially forever; it's relatively easy to import, e.g. a book wholesaler's catalog into a good database system like Oracle. Given a good web server, scripting language, and interface to the database, building such a site is a pretty straightforward proposition. You can read all about it, and a lot more, in <<a href="http://photo.net/wtr/thebook">http://photo.net/wtr/thebook</a>>.<p>

The hard part is making sure the site stays up 24/7.<p>

I should point out that I now work for ArsDigita, the folks who did, e.g. MIT Press' site, and whose CEO wrote "Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing," the online version of which I referred to above.
