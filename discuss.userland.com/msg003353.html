But most of the web designers I know still use Netscape. Some of them read mail with Eudora, some of them with MailSmith, and some of them with mutt (a popular Unix mail reader).<p>

To use things like Mail To The Future, these designers would need to change (1) their web browser, (2) their mail client and sometimes (3) their operating system. It gets even worse when you consider customers--can *any* web designer ask all their customers to change e-mail packages and web browsers?<p>

If MTTF requires Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Explorer and a Microsoft mail reader, you'll find that you've excluded most of your customer base from day one. The web is about compatibility, not exclusiveness.
