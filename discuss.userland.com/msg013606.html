"It seems like you could drive a lot of knowledge into the Frontier user base if you published the source."<p>

To which Dave Winer responded<BR>
<i>We ship the full source for Manila with Frontier 6.1.</i><p>

Leave it to people who work for companies going after the so-called Content Management market to suggest that other people open their source code.  Let he who closely guards his source code be the first to open up.<p>

Isn't most of StoryServer still written in Tcl?  Why not release it all?  I would argue a lot more people know the Tcl language than the Frontier scripting language at the moment.<p>

While we're at it, let's second guess another developer's carefully considered price positioning.  I mean, why not question it?  After all, everyone else in the market is charging at least 5 figures (and quite often 6 figures) for a usable configuration of their software.<p>

Does anyone else object to the implication that if your software costs less than $10,000 per installation that you don't have a realistic business model?<p>

Somebody's got to create the killer app in the Content Management space, don't they?  If you charge over $1,000 for your software, and it basically requires a professional services contract -- are you ready for this folks -- you ain't selling the killer app.  (I can see the job offers from The Gartner Group landing in my mailbox now.)<p>

Who knows if Userland has it right or not?  Certainly not me, but, their pricing makes more sense than the other six commercial products I've looked at for my customers.<p>

Hey Dave, the way I wrote this comment, it should have all been in italics.<p>
