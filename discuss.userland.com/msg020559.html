<p>That probably isn't too bad.  It gives us a quick way to understand understand things without becoming license lawyers.  When I started a project in 1997 I rolled my <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~mpTOOLS/copyright.html">own</a>.  It was a pain, when I would rather have been creating software.  I probably wouldn't do that now.  I'd choose one of the above that fit the situation and go with it.  I agree with you David, that a system where there is only one open source license would be less optimal.</p>
