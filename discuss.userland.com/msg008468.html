<i>Right. Following redirects is a rather new feature in tcp.httpClient and as far as I know the feature is not being used in the released version of myUserland.root.</i><p>

OK- it is now . ;-)<p>

You are correct, though: newsToRss.xml is behind a #members directive. Hmmm. This'll be tricky. I want to have a news page that is members-only, and also have a portal page where members of that group can choose that channel...<p>

Tcp.httpClient defines an adrHdrTable parameter. Could the cookie be stored in memberInfo, then sent in a constructed adrHdrTable? Where can I find the definition of that table?<p>
