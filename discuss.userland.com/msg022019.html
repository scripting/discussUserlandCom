It's stored on the server in two forms -- as an outline and as rendered HTML text. Before tonight, if you clicked on Edit This Page to edit it in the browser, you'd get the HTML text. Make a change, you'll see it in the rendering. However, the next time you edited in it Radio, you would get the old text, since ETP wasn't updating the outline. <br><br>	The bug is fixed, and in a pretty elegant way, imho. <br><br>	Now when you ETP an outline in the browser, you get the OPML text. (<a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/editingOpmlInBrowserScreen.gif">Screen shot</a>.) You can edit it. The changes are reflected in both the rendered HTML text and in the outline. When you edit it in Radio, you get the changes. No loss of synchronization. <br><br>	It might be a little scary to edit OPML in a web browser, if so, don't do it (click on the Back button in the browser), but I kind of like it. But I'm weird. I know that. You can quote me.<br><br><b>Linking to XML, revisited<a name="linkingToXmlRevisited">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/12/15#linkingToXmlRevisited" title="Permanent link to 'Linking to XML, revisited' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Yesterday I flip-flopped on my <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/12/14#linkingToXml">Linking To XML</a> icon. Should it be 12-by-12, or some other size, should I punt and just do the link in text? Problems problems. In the end I went with an icon, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/xmlIcon2.gif">36-by-14</a>, and solved the awkwardness by placing the icon away from the text for the directory. It looks good. I've had a chance to use the site that has the link, and it sneaks up on me the right way, so we have a solution. <br><br>	I've already heard from one developer who wants to use the icon in the same way. Please do. It's best if it always means the same thing. Click on this icon to get the XML behind this HTML page. In the old days we used to call these "user interface standards" and they're good things, they fit into the human mind in a nice way.<br><br>	Want to see how it works? I added the new icon to the Radio UserLand <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/directory/3541">directory</a>. If you have a Manila site and are doing directories, here's <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/radioAsAManilaDirectoryEditingTool#configuringYourDirectory">how to</a> add an XML icon to your directory, and why you might want to do it.<br><br>
