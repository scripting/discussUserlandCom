Right now, if a major bug crops up in Linux, you have a patch in a few days, it is incorporated into the kernel in the next release, and released by the "vendors" in the quarterly updates. Not all fixes make it into releases.<p>

Only time will tell how NS will handle bug fixes, but I would say that quarterly releases of the Communicator product would be about right.<p>

As long as the major bug exists in the Moz code, you can expect a patch quickly, and then you can use the Mozilla browser until the next release.<p>

What one does expect are more diverse options for the browser. A browser which  understands "XML-RPC" may be a stand alone product until it gets blessed by the mozilla community. And certain things will probably never be fully incorporated. Doczilla is like this. How many of us need a full SGML display engine? why have the extra 2 megs for the sgml stuff. <p>

And some versions of Moz may have the What's related feature removed. if not, compile it yourself w/o the feature. Distribute if you feel it is necessary. In the future, you have a choice.
