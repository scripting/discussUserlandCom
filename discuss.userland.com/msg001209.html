It had a few features that were much more intuitive than version 6.5, and there were some terminology changes as well. I would recommend waiting for that, or working with the newest beta version, which was pretty solid.<p>

I wasn't able to find a beta download page, but there is a good overview page at: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/backoffice/sql/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/backoffice/sql/default.htm</a><p>

I've only found so-so books on SQL Server 6.5 administration, but the one that I use day to day is Jeffrey Byrne's Microsoft SQL Server, What Database Aministrators Need to Know, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0134954092/qid=913733702/sr=1-15/002-6047617-1716253">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0134954092/qid=913733702/sr=1-15/002-6047617-1716253</a><p>

The MSCE training guide for SQL 7 was actually more helpful than any of books I perused, but I didn't get that until just recently.<p>

Hope this helps.
