My understanding is that under present law if you file for a patent knowing the existence of prior art, the patent and all claims -- even those unrelated to the prior art -- are revoked. So that's pretty good, but it doesn't address the obviousness issue except in cases where one can say that the jump to the bogus patent from the prior art is so obvious that it really is no different from the prior art.
