O'Reilly/Random House (I don't know about the second edition)
is a very readable UNIX text. From basics to advanced topics.
It is the first book with hypertext (links, I mean) integrated into 
its flow that I ever saw. Very readable and engaging.
For LINUX programming I would recommend Begining Linux Programming,
by Neil Matthew & Richard Stones (Wrox Press). You have a programmer's brain and I am sure you will like it. The examples work perfectly well under MachTen on a PPC (in case you start to miss your mac ;->).
Once you start playing with Linux you will be amazed that such a power
it's been given away for free.(on second thought you are doing the same with Frontier!). I would advice you to give your self a daily or, according to your schedule, perhaps a weekly project, and stick to it. For instance get cross plataform printing to work (check SAMBA[windows]<a href="http://lake.canberra.edu.au/pub/samba/samba.html">http://lake.canberra.edu.au/pub/samba/samba.html</a> and 
Netatalk[appletalk]<a href="http://wwwumich.edu/~rsug/netatalk">http://wwwumich.edu/~rsug/netatalk</a>.
For two good books on Linux SystemAdm. check on amazona.com for the authors Hein, Jochen (Addison-Wesley) and in a second search Komarinski, Mark and Collett, Cary (Prentice Hall PTR).
Enjoy!
