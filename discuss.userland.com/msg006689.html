There's a lot of work done <i>every</i> time a page is accessed. Height & width is pulled out of images, macros i patching together the template framework, <head> is created etc etc. A large part of this is recreating exactly the same code over and over again.<p>

It should be possible to cache this code, and gain speed.<p>

For this to work, we need a way to cache parts of a page (if the entire page remains the same we already has a caching scheeme: render to static pages).<p>

<b>Maybe it can be done like this:</b>
<ul>
<li>We tag every part that we want to cache with something like <cache cacheid = someName>...</cache> <br>(the cached part must contain macros, otherwise there is nothing gained)
<li>In pageFilter we check every cacheid and see if we have anything stored for it. <br>If we have, we substitute that for the <cache>...</cache>. <br>We save a list of the id:s that did not have anything cached.
<li>In finalFilder we take that list and extracts the <cache>...</cache>-contents for those chacheid:s and store them.
</ul><p>

<b>Things needed:</b>
<ul>
<li>Extract and substitute rutines that are fast (Regex?)
<li>Verbs to delete the cache & the removes items from the 'put in cache with finalFilter'-list (to be used by macros and scripts that wants to make a change to the contents of a <cache>...</cache>)
<li>Maybe we also need verbs to handle caching on a more fine-grained level than that of pageFilter/finalFilter.
</ul>
