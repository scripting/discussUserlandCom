There are 2 new verbs in Frontier 5.1.4 that can do this: setTimeCreated and setTimeModified.  They don't yet have docserver pages so I'll give you this snippet from the change notes--<p>

<ul>Added two new basic verbs: setTimeCeated (adr, time) and setTimeModified (adr, time). These verbs complement the existing timeCreated and timeModified verbs. They can be usefull for keeping a database structure in sync with a folder hierarchy on disk, for example.</ul><p>

Note that a search for setTimeCreated in the search engine did not bring up this page, because setTimeCreated is misspelled.  setTimeModified found it, however.<p>
