I know that they turn a lot of stuff on by default, and you typically want a lot of things off if you're accessible through the net.<p>

Things to watch for from a security point of view. (this is easier if you're behind a firewall)<p>

Turn off imapd in /etc/inetd.conf.  (comment out the line with a # sign.) <p>

There's been an update to ftpd too.<p>

Turn off services that you don't need. (I can see you needing apache, samba, maybe named on a caching only basis, maybe syslogd. Ftp.  I'd turn off sendmail, popd, and almost anything else you don't understand from inetd.conf.) Disable rsh, rexec and friends.<p>

Make sure that root cannot telnet in (see securetty), or at least if it can, that telnet is only allowed from trusted hosts.<p>

Check out the hosts.allow and hosts.deny files for access control to the various services. (don't allow access to portmapper/nfs or x windows ports from across the net.)<p>
