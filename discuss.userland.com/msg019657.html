Adobe vs. Macromedia. Take a look at<a href="http://www.adobefacts.com/examples_a.html#imageready">this example by Adobe</a> explaining copyright infringement.<p>

Here is my take on that.<p>

I hereby proclaim that I should ask anyone who is younger than me to quit breathing. I was on this planet before you and I invented breathing. I will sue anyone who engages in the act of breathing simliar to mine. <p>

Quit that, I tell you. Quit breathing like me. You may invent a new way of breathing and make sure you patent it so you can sue all those who come after you who engage in the breathing process patented by you. <p>

This Adobe thing is ridiculous. Nuff said.
Breath on. Enjoy.
