Look at the keyboard. Either the keyboard commands are structural (outliner) or textual (word processor). Same thing with the mouse and the menus and the layout of text inside a window. If you're doing an outliner you arrange things differently from a wp or a spreadsheet. That's what really differentiates the different programs, how they arrange things. <p>

Now with scripting it would be possible to have one program take a variety of approaches, according to your preference, but it's still true that no matter how much text smarts we added to Frontier's outliner, it would still be be an outliner, not a word processor.
