I guess that was a mistake. Anyway, as I'm sure you've noticed, a lot of work is going on at the RSS-DEV list. This is a very exciting format and a very exciting time. <p>

RSS didn't do a lot -- just provided a list of links and titles in XML -- but that's what made it so powerful. It could be used by anyone for many purposes. That was also its major weakness. Dave saw it for syndication, others saw it for site description, I see it as a publication format for CMSs. Extensibility gives it the power to be all of that, yet with a simple link and title system underlying it all.<p>

I think that's cool, I think that's moving RSS forward. Others see it differently.
