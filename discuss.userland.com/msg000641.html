We're mapping the platform-specific characters onto the HTML entities at render-time. That's why you can type those characters on your Mac/Win machine, it's stored in our NT-based server database and then sent back out to the browser in the form that it understands. But stuff can always break, so I'm glad to see it's working! Dave
