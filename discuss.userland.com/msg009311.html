However, if I simply put a link to the image on my page, I am <B>referring to</B> your work -- not even quoting it! -- and thus exercising my natural right to free speech.<p>

Also, remember that copyight is (a) not a natural right, and (b) not extensibe to meta-data.  A URL is meta-data, just like your address.  Even if you have an internal mail stop on your address, you can't prevent people from recounting it.  You <B>don't</B> have the right to say exactly how your copyrighted work is interpreted, discussed, referred to, etc., you only have the right to control access and distribution.  And access control is easy -- use accounts with passwords.<p>
