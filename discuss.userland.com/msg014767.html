Last I heard, though, it was used for periodic updates to the SWF and GIF versions of the site (what it calls "offline generation"), rather than for creating a new file for each visitor on demand (what it calls "online generation"). If your content doesn't change with each page view, then it can be more efficient to render at periodic intervals rather than at each serving request.<p>

You should still be able to do the same thing *without* Macromedia Generator, by using the client-pull abilities in the Flash 4 Player. This shifts the data-integration chores into the client... it requires an extra download (the graphic display and the current data are two separate streams), but... hmm, have you checked out <a href="http://www.shockfusion.com/">http://www.shockfusion.com/</a> yet?<p>
