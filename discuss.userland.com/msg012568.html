<I>The whole idea is that I can implement in C++ if that's what floats my boat, or that's what my environment calls for. Using XML/HTTP, you can implement in Java and communicate seamlessly with my C++/MSMQ/COM software. You've taken the cross-platform answer and de-cross-platformed it by suggesting that one must use Java to have a real cross-platform system.</I><p>

For what it's worth, I didn't get this from what Ron wrote. Rather, I got that he wrote, in effect, "if you implement the middleware in Visual Basic or C++, using whatever communications tools are given you by your platform, your product will only work on that platform." Not one word about Java there at all, actually.<p>

Of course, later in the same article, he does go on to say, in effect, that Java is the only way to get cross-platform code. This is, of course, strictly not true, but when I think about the extent of Java's coverage, including, e.g. cross-platform GUI tools, I'm slightly more sympathetic.
