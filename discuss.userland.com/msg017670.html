I'm getting a demo of <a href="http://www.radiov.com/">http://www.radiov.com/</a> from Michael Gosney. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow.<p>

"People are going to build their own soundtrack from a much wider array of choices than the old commercial music paradigm allowed. Everyone will be their own DJ," says Gosney.<p>

"I want Joni Mitchell."<p>

Gosney says "Fine, you should be able to get an old Joni track for $0.50."<p>
