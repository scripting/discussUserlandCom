So, putting a book together is likely to require a lot of planning, writing, revision, and editing, even before the first edition comes out. It doesn't work very well if you conceive a book, write an outline, fill in some core chapters, leave the rest blank, and ship *that*, with the rest to be filled in in later editions.

The same arguments have been made about software. A beek can be written the same way that Open Source software projects run. It maybe mutch more dificult for the typical fiction but the same was said about writing an operating system with this method. <p>

Besides it seems like many of the web related books I have read sprung from efforts began on the web. In the beginning there are just a few articles but eventualy the collected work is transformed and converted into a printed book. <p>

Just because it seems hard/dificult now does not mean that it is imposiable.
