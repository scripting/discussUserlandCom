The last part isn't quite true.  All of the free software that they use is covered by licenses that let you keep your changed version proprietary.  Some of those components (e.g., Mach) have changed substantially since NeXT started using them over 10 years ago.  The source tree they use has been evolving separately from the open source versions.<p>

So they <i>have</i> gone above and beyond the license terms, but I still agree that it isn't momentous.  After all, the world doesn't particularly need another free BSD or Mach fork.  We already have plenty of good operating systems, and there's very little chance that this will generate a lot of interest.<p>

When they announce a Free QuickTime, then I'll get excited.
