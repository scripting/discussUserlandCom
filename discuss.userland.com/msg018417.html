I also find it even odder that sometimes the text attribute can be XML.<p>

It would make more sense to me if the file had a format like this:
<a href="http://www.spilth.org/xml/currentOutline/alternateFormat.xml">http://www.spilth.org/xml/currentOutline/alternateFormat.xml</a><p>

This way when you are going through the document via SAX or DOM it's easier to tell when you've jumped up or down to a new level of items.  And the rules are easily extractable.<p>

Knowing a bit how the outliner works in Frontier/Pike this would probably make things harder on that end, but I think that's ok because it's the end result (XML) that's supposed to be easy to understand.<p>

This is just my XML-newbie point of view.
