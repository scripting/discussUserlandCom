Before I get too far into it, I'd like to get some input about what people want/need in such a plug-in...<p>

If you have experience in managing banner ad campaigns, I'd like to hear from you. Here, <a href="http://manilaisp.webwerks.co.nz/discuss/msgReader$408">ManilaISP</a>, or by private email would be fine.<p>

What kind of things do you need to track about a campaign?<p>

What do you need to encode in a URL?<p>

Anything you can think of that might help create a better product would be much appreciated.<p>

Thanks in advance.
