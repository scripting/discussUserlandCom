Going to be hard to bootstrap. Today there are no searches you can do there that return meaningful results. Further, I doubt that you could come up with a query language that anyone but a programmer could figure out. Now, if there were some high-flow format (like RSS) that had a lot of content, you could do a SE that produced meaningful results. My opinion --> that's where the juice is.
