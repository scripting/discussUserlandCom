<I>Please don't edit system.paths -- to do so is to edit a very critical section of Frontier. There are always ways to accomplish things without editing this table.</I><p>

I've got my website in a guest database, and I want to make the #tools table accessible, as I used to edit the path to do so.  By "accessible", I mean that while running the scripts in "#tools" for the purposes of debugging, other references to "#tools" are considered in scope.  So, if I had:<p>

#tools
<UL><LI>createLink</LI>
<LI>listOfLinks</LI>
</UL><p>

I could debug listOfLinks, which references simply "createLink", without giving the full path.  In addition, I have nested tables and such.<p>

Basically, I want to add #tools to the path, without adding #tools to the path.  How exactly is this done?<p>

(note that during render time, this isn't a problem, as the #tools table acts in exactly the fashion I need.  That still makes debugging hard.)
