                                 redistributed the enhanced-TF software, and contributed almost nothing, if anything at all, back to the

<P>
Not a problem. Whenever you make something freely available to all, you can expect that the <i>majority</i> of users will be "free riders." This is true whether they're end users or programmers. It's even true with GPLed stuff such as Linux, since many programmers create enhanced versions of GPLed programs, use them in house, and never distribute them. To single out commercial programmers who do derivative works is to target a very specific group for special negative treatment.
<P>
With Truly Free Software, commercial programmers will have two options. They can contribute their own code, and be relieved of the burden of maintaining it and/or having to integrate it into each new version of the published code. Or, if it is what makes them their bread and butter, they can take on the burdens mentioned above. They will be rewarded if people will willingly pay for their work.
<P>
Many developers start by selling their work and ultimately contribute it after they feel that they've been adequately rewarded for doing it. This is a nice option that the GPL doesn't allow.
