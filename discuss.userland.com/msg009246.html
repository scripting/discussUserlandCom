MS has been told by AOL that they do not want the MSN MESS program accessing thier system via undocumented protocols.<p>

MSN Mess updates itself, usually to work around said problem. <p>

SOLUTION:
 MS should use the automatic update to disable the AOL accesing features.<p>

My observations:<p>

It's two multi-billion dollar babies having a spat. This is a lose-lose situation.<p>

MSN got tossed off my system when one of the updates asked to reboot the computer. What piece of system software MS updating that required a reboot? (seems like the www.windows2000test.com gets rebooted, all too often).<p>

MSN mess is a too bit intrusive for my taste. I like IM when I want it. Not all the time. MSN mess started up with outlook, and stayed up. There was no way to disable this behavior in the version I had. Invisible is really not the feature I want. On/Off when I say so is.<p>

MS has not provided a way to acees the exchange IM services. MS should make the first "opening" move. I think they miscalcuated the communities response. If we say open, eveyone will back us.
