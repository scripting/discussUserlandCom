Since the <font> tag is deprecated in HTML 4.0 and beyond, I've been using <small> and <big> to handle sizes instead for a long while now. I'd love to avoid going back to using <font size="-1">.<p>

(I know the use of <small> and <big> <b>are</b> officially discouraged in favor of style sheets [see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/present/graphics.html#h-15.2">official remarks</a>], but they are still legal and, significantly, still serve their purpose when the client doesn't support style sheets or has CSS turned off.)<p>

It would be very handy for me (and maybe others).
