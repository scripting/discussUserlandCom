Some general observations:<p>

<li>People often post because they can, not because they should, or because they have something to say.
<li>American often have the ridiculous notion that 'free speech' mean that they have the right to say whatever they want. I think some of that 'say what I want' culture is encoded into the 'Net's DNA.  
<li>The medium itself does not encourage thought and reflection--it's far too easy to speak up.<p>

<i>What's in it for me?</i><p>

Well, that's a question you'll have to answer for yourself, I think. However, let me say this: you have put a lot of time and effort into creating a forum around your ideas, and a community of sorts has formed around those ideas.  That in and of itself is a cool thing.  <p>

You should also remember, that there is a wider audience than those who give knee-jerk responses.  Far more people are listening than are responding.<p>

Cheers, Phil
