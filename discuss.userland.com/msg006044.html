Interesting. Sounds very much like the Display PostScript technology that the NeXT had (has?).<p>

This is the same story they announced at *last* year's WWDC.  Only the name "Quartz" is new.<p>

The released MacOS X Server is based on Display PostScript.  I'm not sure why they changed to PDF (which when you get down to it is just a  PostScript encoding without if/then/else and loops) but suspect that it's a question of licensing fees.<p>

<i>As far as the MRJ goes, according to the website the MRJ 2.1.2 is JDK 1.1.7 compliant. This is better than it's been in the past (1.0.x compliant). But at the same time, consider this: Java hit the 1.1.x mark over a year ago.</i><p>

MRJ has been at 1.1.6 since September or October or so and 1.1.7 has only been out since the start of the year.<p>

MRJ has the same Swing version as 1.2.<p>

For most of the last year they've been concentrating on performance and are only now worrying about tracking Sun's releases more closely (which is what they <b>said</b> they were going to do at last yeat's WWDC, if you went to the Java sessions).<p>


It's damn nice to see Apple actually having the same story from one WWDC to the next, and even better that they've actually accomplished what they said they would in many areas.  MAcOS X Server released, on schedule, and a developer preview of MacOS X too?  <b>excellent</b>
