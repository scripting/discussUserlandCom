With Frontier running I can tie XML-RPC to arbitrary scripts that run the Mac OS?  Windows?  Via COM?  There's this fantasy world where all apps can talk to each other via a uniform layer and the user can program how they act.  Actually that world doesn't seem so far away, it just takes some Usertalk hacking.  Mind you, Frontier seems a bit heavyweight for this, and if it goes down, bad things happen.  Hmm.  Too bad it's not a system level server and set of services that all apps could deal with.  Then Frontier would be a coding interface to it, but it would get out of the way when you aren't coding.
