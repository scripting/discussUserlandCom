Ditto. And as someone contemplating rejoining the legions of music makers, I'm just as excited. I don't know about the rest of the country, but in Hawai'i the 70s and 80s were a great time for live music. Musicians gigging all over the place, big name rockers and jazzers (George Benson, Stevie Wonder, Michael MacDonald) just sitting in with bands in little hole in the wall clubs. I'm hoping all this attention is going to revive some of the interest in live music here. It' should to be a great ride.
