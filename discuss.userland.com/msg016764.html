If you look at the programming overheads that were required to get IE running on Solaris and HP/UX, it's pretty clear that Office would require a de facto virtual Windows machine in which to function. And that kind of development effort isn't really worth it.<p>

Then again, Linux doesn't need Office: certainly not in the way that Apple needed it a few years ago. In fact, the negotiations which guaranteed the shipping of Office 98 for Mac, in return for the pre-eminence of IE on the Mac desktop, demonstrate the need to separate the browser business from the application business far more than any of Microsoft's actions on the Windows platform.<p>

There are perfectly functional office suites for Linux. In fact, the Oxford University network offers WordPerfect/Linux over NFS, ironically proving that Linux can drive workstations as well as servers. But Linux isn't an <i>office</i> OS. Running office suites on Linux reminds me of when I run the Win32 port of GNU Emacs: it's a valuable tool, and I'm glad that it's there, but it doesn't feel quite like it <i>belongs</i> there...
