Not so hard, though. My Personal Portal sucks down the xml version of Scripting News. I think there's a couple more Frontier-based sites which are maintaining .xml versions. (Does Tomalak? No. ;-( ) So the ability is going to be there. I really think the combination of XML and subscriptions / syndication is going to expand the publishing paradigm on the web.<p>

If you run a Frontier-based weblog, let us know!<p>

I'd like to see scriptingnews.xml become an xml-rpc call as well, so, for example, I can register with Dave that I'm subscribing to his content. The rpc call could register me the first time I call it, then afterwords it doesn't bother. But it would give Dave a record of who is "subscribing", and send out information along with the xml that was intended only for his subscription / syndication audience.
