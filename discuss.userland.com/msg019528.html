How many of those minorities attending really got to participate in the real convention, the one the corporate sponsors put on?</i><p>

So I suppose you have just judged the many minorities that attended and believe in the Republican Party to not know their own minds. I suppose you know better for them, right?<p>

You should give other people and minorities credit. They're not  the stereotype you seem to have come to expect from them. I'm glad and welcome all folks interested in the Republican view of America. I don't think  minorities are being stupid or cheated. They probably don't appreciate other folks picturing them differently. Sorry to burst your bubble. :-)<p>

I guess you'll have to see for yourself in the years to come under Republican administrations starting with the upcoming one in early 2001. As Dick Cheney said the other day, "Help is on the way!";-)<p>
