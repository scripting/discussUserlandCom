Yes, I guess I do that kind of thing automatically in many contexts. For the same reason that I automatically rewrite reply titles, so you get to read "simple, effective ways to categorize" when scanning the headlines at discuss.userland.com, instead of "re: Categories + type of content."<p>

These are just little habits, but they add up to a big effect in layered information systems. In traditional writing and journalism fields, the power of the headline is well-understood. It is less well-understood in cyberspace.<p>

Here's another example: HTML doctitles -- that is, the stuff between <title> and </title> in web pages. These things are an incredible resource, both user-visible and -- crucially -- returned by  all search engines. A little attention to fielding and categorization with doctitles pays off *huge* dividends in a number of different ways. For example, a controlled doctitle namespace lets you do a wonderful job of categorizing search results coming out of *any* search engine. This is something almost nobody pays attention to, though.<p>
