I was puzzled. Does he know me? How could he, when I was so far from home. Later I realized this was a different custom. Outside NY, where I grew up, it's not uncommon for people to greet each other, even strangers. In NY, this is unheard-of.</i><p>

Heh. Reminds me of my favorite scene in <i>Crocodile Dundee</i>. He's flying into NYC and says, "Imagine 7 million people all wantin' to live together. New York must be the friendliest place on earth!" Then we cut to Mick walking down a busy Manhattan street saying, "G'Day" to each person he passes and tipping his hat. Hilarious!<p>

Here in Idaho we say "Hi" to strangers as well. In rural areas, we even wave at strangers in oncoming cars. It really freaks people from big cities out! I remember a Chicago native telling me that Pocatello, Idaho was just too friendly and he really needed for someone to be rude to him to make him feel comfortable.<p>

Me, I'll stick with friendly.
