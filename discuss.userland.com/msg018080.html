They're not quite sure whether to edit the compiled XML, or the text in the site prefs wizard outline.<p>

The right place is the outline.<p>

Another thing to keep in mind is that the panel names in the wizard outline should remain in English, as well as the URLs in the navigator outline. The names of the prefs pages are localized as strings in the [language].strings.admin table.<p>

The order you translate things in is totally up to you.<p>

By far, the largest task is translating the site prefs in the wizard outline. There are all the preference names, as well as popup text.<p>

You shouldn't have to write any code yourself.
