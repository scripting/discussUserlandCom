For example, if the <CR> is typed on your side, your Frontier "client" will send the other person's Frontier "server" a signal and then Frontier will tell the browser to refresh.<p>

I don't know how possible it is, but even if it's doable, I wouldn't recommend to go that route, since it eliminates people who don't have Frontier to participate (although if it's in XML-RPC, then any scripting system that supports XML-RPC and can script the browsers would be able to use it as well).
