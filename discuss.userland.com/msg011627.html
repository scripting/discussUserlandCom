Designers *are* important.  They are needed to ensure the communication to the reader is effective.<p>

However, designing on the web and designing on, say, print materials, are totally different.  Designing on print means translating what you say into what your reader will see.  Total control from start to finish.  Designing on the web means translating from what you say into what the browser will see.  The browser will then do another layer of translation from what the browser see, to what the reader will see.  (And by "browser", I don't just mean one piece of software.)<p>

Designers cannot just give "options" and take away "control". Don't ignore the browser.<p>
