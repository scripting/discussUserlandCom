Here's a quote:<p>


Imagine a virtual friend who can read every newspaper and
                                  web site, digest every TV and radio broadcast and filter it
                                  into a format that meets our individual needs and interests.
                                  This will be a personal assistant that no one will want to be
                                  without.<p>

It would be really interesting if someone could come up with something like this which could read RSS news headlines or tell you what's new with editthispage.com or something.<p>

I think a great start for a more "open" version of annanova would be at haptek's site.  They have a very realistic human/non-human simulator which runs as a plugin, but can "speak" anything you send to it.  <p>
