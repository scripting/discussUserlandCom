As long as I'm writing rules to parse HTML to extract information it's actually easier for me to discard the ads (one less element to look for).<p>

How about something like (all URLs are to my own site and only there as placeholders):<p>

<payment&gt; <bannerad&gt; <frequency&gt; .1 </frequency&gt; <contenturl&gt; <a href="http://www.flutterby.com/adbanners/mmunicate.gif">http://www.flutterby.com/adbanners/mmunicate.gif</a> </contenturl&gt; <linkto&gt; <a href="http://www.flutterby.com/">http://www.flutterby.com/</a> </linkto&gt; </bannerad&gt; </payment&gt;<p>

This would let me say "If you want to carry this piece one of the payment options is to show a banner ad, one for every 10 snippets from this stream that you use, and here's the URL to display and to link to".<p>

For those of us who are completely ego driven, rather than an "ad" tag there might be a "credit" tag with a link element and a text element.
