That's true. I don't think there's anything wrong with pushing the web in new directions, esp if, at the same time, you're careful to evangelize potential competitors, as we do at UserLand.<p>

And no, we don't have any patents. I think they suck. I love Doc, but I wish he'd stop pointing to Amazon. It makes me think twice about pointing to him. Better to take a stand when it counts, and fight the patent abusers, like Amazon.
