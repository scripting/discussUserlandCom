P( a or not a ) = 1<br>
P( you or not you ) = 1 <br>
p( you ) = 1- P( not you ) <br><p>

So the real question is, do you exist?<p>

or <p>

If we put you in a sealed box and didn't look, would you half exist and half not exist? At the same time? <p>

Or perhaps you want to argue from the line of: <p>

What is the probabability that you exist given the number of possible other existences. (it's something like infinity/(infinity^infinity), (or replace infinity with something on the order of 10^80 and probably more confusingly phrased as 'what is the probability of the universe's current quantum state'.) Which can be rounded off to a very small number. )<p>

So based on faulty statistics, hand waving quantum mechanics, and round off error, we can conclude that the probablilty that you exist in your current state is ... 0. <p>

We shall conclude this post with a hymn:
<pre>
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure, 
How amazingly unlikely is your birth; 
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space, 
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!
