At Python?<p>

You do realize that there are businesses that will measure a language by how many books they find on Amazon?<p>

Much of the focus on hyping "OpenSource" was born in demanding <b>respect</b> for this work -- for the acknowledgement that these tools were often better produced, better supported, better documented than their commercial equivalent. You just have to look at platform support to see <b>that</b>.<p>

So does the <b>hype</b> have anything to do with talking about Open Source? Mm.<p>

A more interesting question (IMHO) is whether Frontier for Linux would be proceeding at a quicker pace if the source were available?<p>

(I've got no theories on that -- it'd be daft to think there's a simple answer...)
