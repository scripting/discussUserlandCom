That plus today's "Java no longer WORA" note leaves me wondering which horse to bet on in the the upcoming virtual engine wars. <p>

- what's the chance of MS's runtime being available on other platforms. Mac? Linux?
- Or third parties writing compatible runtimes?
- Can Sun eventually succeed in delivering a platform that runs reliably on a variety of systems?
- Is C++ (with home-rolled system class wrappers) still the only way to write code that's truly portable?<p>

I really wish I could focus on a language + API and code without having to worry about the politics back-firing down the road (I'm still pretty traumatised by the OpenDoc massacre).<p>

Any opinions/speculation welcome.<p>
