The first thing I noticed after upgrading was that Frontier is quitting "correctly" (it doesn't take forever to do so) on my PPC G3, System 8.5.1; the webserver also doesn't take too long to turn on and off. The overall perception is that it has become more stable. I love working with Frontier, it's easy to stay up-to-date with the Update button in the Main menu (where else?), and the software continually produces new ideas in my head as I work with it.<p>

Especially fascinating is the .wsf and responder division, and I seriously think that Userland has come a long way at redefining what "web publishing" and "workflow" means: It's so incredibly elegant to keep the scripts and data in the same namespace and make all of it accessible/manageable via HTTP. I'm beginning to understand why you were urging everybody to embrace XML 15 months ago...<p>

I totally agree that learning systems are an issue! For Version 6, I have an urgent desire: Please provide coherent, exhausting documentation about the XML-RPC stuff and other advanced Frontier features. Responders are spread all over the place (builtins.betty, user.webserver, builtins.webserver), and so is the documentation: an How-to here, one there, some remarks on script meridian, a post by Matt duplicated on Scripting News... These individual articles are great, some really enlightening, but sometimes I'm missing the big picture nonetheless.<p>

I *know* there is a logic, a way of thinking behind most everything in the root. But when you just start to learn a new feature, it's hard to recognize the "patterns" in the first place, although they are there. (This reminds me, if only a little bit, of the situation with DHTML before Goodman's book was published. Some docs at Netscape, some at Microsoft, and complexity is rising bitwise: Platforms x browsers x versions.) Believe me, you do yourself a favor by enabeling more people to go deep inside the root and understand it's inner workings when they need to.<p>

Yes, when they need to. Frontier has become so powerful that an average user has to apply "learning on demand", and that is still hard with the available documentation, althogh I admit that the situation has substantially improved since, say, one year ago.<p>

An elegant web based interface for web management, BTW, is something that our customers ask for all the time, I can't wait to get my hands on Frontier 6.<p>

Thank you for listening.
