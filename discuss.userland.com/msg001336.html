I mean nothing of the sort.<p>

I mean exactly what I said, nothing more or less.<p>

This is a really awkward way to argue and a lot of people fall for it. Saying what someone means (what you think they mean) and then arguing with that instead of arguing with what they said.<p>

I used to fall for it myself! My eyes opened when I found that a friend was arguing with me, saying stuff that I agreed with. I stopped the argument by saying I agree with you. My friend didn't even hear me, the argument continued, getting more and more ridiculous, I kept laughing, and finally I was able to be heard. I kept saying over and over, I agree with you, I agree with you, I agree with you. Sometimes people just can't hear it.<p>

Now, to go back to what I really believe. I believe that there were facts that were withheld, and there were lies, and no one except Clinton knows where the truth leads. There were real accusations of sexual harassment. The truth could prove that crimes were committed, or it might prove that they weren't. We can't know until there's a rigorous examination of the events, including the lies and supposed perjury.<p>
