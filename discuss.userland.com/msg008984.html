Why the name-calling? I don't even see the point you're trying to make in calling me a luddite? I don't want my IM client to be a jumble of confusing features, so I am opposed to technology? (By the way, have you ever tried ICQ? It tries to do so many things that it ends up being practically unusable for anyone but the most die-hard users.)<p>

In any case, it doesn't really matter if I was wrong about you having recently discovered IM... there ARE plenty of other people discovering it for the first time. It used to be only geeks and kids who used IM, and now people like my Mom are using it. I don't see how a person can think that IM is "dead", unless they also think that email died a couple years ago.<p>
