It's since been discontinued by CE, but it was originally marketed as Arrange! beginning around 1994. I believe it resembles Frontier in the sense that it is built around an OODB with an outline structure. It is a fantastic tool for conducting research. There's a little "grabber" init that will collect whatever text you highlight and dump it into a clippings topic. From there you can drag them to the appropriate topic. You can clone items, which I believe was first developed in More, where you change one entry, and they all change, everywhere else they appear.<p>

It was originally marketed as a PIM, but it is so much more powerful than that. CE tried to tie it to the Web and bundled Web Whacker with it to manage offline browsing. I haven't used it in that fashion, but I do use it to collect data on various projects and to organize it for me.<p>

The interface is beginning to look a bit dated, but it is still a very neat, very useful application.<p>

I'm also looking at Ambry on the Mac and Idea Keeper, both have potential and are being developed as shareware.<p>
