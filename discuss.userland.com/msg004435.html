There aren't a lot of docs yet, of course the source is available for those really interested people ;-) but one of the main advantages is that you don't need to be a C++ hacker just to change that annoying toolbar in the bottom right of the window, you can just rearrange text in a file, or better yet use an XML or graphical editor. Create a new window in the browser and it'll use the new format. The code attached to the XUL can be JavaScript or C++, or anything else that gets hooked up, that's built into the browser or added on.<p>
