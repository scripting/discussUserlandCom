Eventually, Netscape would stop showing its animated icon and think it was done loading, but I never saw any more of the page. Sometimes hitting "reload" would get me the whole page, sometimes not.<p>

P.S. It's still doing it today. It just happened when I tried to go back to the main page by typing "http://discuss.userland.com/" into my browser's URL box.
