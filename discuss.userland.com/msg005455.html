The only thing that I would add to Sam's How To is to caution people to make sure that all of the their templates are of the same type.<p>

The assignment: <pre>
    adrPageTable^.template = @adrPageTable^.templates^.print
</pre><p>

won't work correctly if your primary #template is an outline, and your print template is a wptext.<p>

Of course, these days, I can't imagine why someone would use anything but outlines for templates, but maybe that's just me. ;-><p>
