 I sure hope you can get PacBell to do something.  I've had the feeling in the last few months that there is (are) serious problems in the internet as a whole,  because I noticed that many times when Userland.com was having trouble, there were a group of sites I regularly visit which were also having trouble.<p>

 Your new Track-PacBell posting & site got me nostalgic for "internetweather"... as I remember there was controversy over that name...<p>


 "internetweather" became NetCopter <a href="http://netcopter.com">http://netcopter.com</a> ...  I just discovered NetCopter is DEAD... an interesting story on their site, titled 'It Has Been Fun'.<p>


UC Santa Cruz has a site that looks like the old internetweather cum NetCopter site, and some links:<p>

	<a href="http://noc.ucsc.edu/weather/">http://noc.ucsc.edu/weather/</a><p>

Here is one from UC Irvine:<p>

	<a href="http://weather.nts.uci.edu/">http://weather.nts.uci.edu/</a><p>


"internetweather.com" now takes you to here & will bury you in stats:<p>
