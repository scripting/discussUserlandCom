Or post your ratings? I'm thinking about image sharing, movies, etc. </i><p>

<u><b>I want to be very clear, this program is not for sharing music</b></u>.<p>

Your message implies that it is. It is not. Repeat that 18,000 times please. It does not serve music. Please try to be careful when discussing this product. I want to make software, not legal precedent. I know you mean well Andrew.<p>

Anyway, if you have questions, post them, I don't promise an answer here, but will try to address them in the documentation I'm writing.
