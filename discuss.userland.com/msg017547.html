As I think you know, Dave (?), I will be reviewing Frontier/Manila for <a href="http://www.dominopower.com">DominoPower magazine</a> in August, assuming I can find 25 hours in the days. They have asked me to explore the way that Domino/Notes and Frontier/Manila complement and, perhaps, mutually inform-critique one another.<p>

I am ever so gradually using duffer.editthispage.com as a means for exploring those synergies as well as related topics ...
