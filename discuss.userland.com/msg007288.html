I don't really use My.Userland.Com all that much -- I usually just visit the sites directly from my favourites or personal links bar -- but I like the idea.  As to the new interface, it works for me (and I like by your user testing initiative) except that the Favorites page is quite long with the channels in one column (instead of two like before).<p>

One intereting thought I had is that all the XML involved in this thing means that theoretically ambitious users can build their own interface to My.Userland.Com.  Of course I don't know enough about all this yet to know whether that's actually a good idea or not.<p>
