I have some issues with SOAP 1.1 that I'd like to see addressed.  I was a little distressed that SOAP 1.1 was released with major changes from 1.0 with no chance for public comment (that I'm aware of).  By comparison, the W3C process apparently has "working draft" and "candidate recommendation" before "recommendation" .<p>

I'll be posting comments on SOAP to the <a href="http://develop.com/SOAP/">SOAP mailing list</a>.
