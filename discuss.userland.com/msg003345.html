Does the server have to have the same name as the one that the XML-RPC request is going to? If it resolves to the same IP address, is that enough to satisfy the security constraints of Java?<p>

The reason I ask is that storing it in discuss.userland.com may not be good enough. It may have to appear to come from www.mailtothefuture.com to work with that application.<p>
