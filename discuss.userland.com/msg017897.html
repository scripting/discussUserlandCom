I'm not saying this will work -- in fact I believe its a dead-in-the-water idea -- but the current thinking seems to be that new content will be protected by DRM systems. The Forrester guy has it right IMHO when he says DRM can at best provide zero value to users and at worst negative value, and thus will fail in the marketplace.<p>
