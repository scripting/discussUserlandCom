<blockquote>"This type library contains references to COM interfaces used internally by Outlook Express. In effect, this is Outlook Express plumbing that has been accidentally exposed in Visual Basic. <p>

"Use of these interfaces in any programming environment is not supported. Because this object model was created only for internal use by Outlook Express components, the object model was not designed or tested to accommodate the theoretical needs of external developers. Unsupported code that uses these interfaces is likely to break in an unpredictable fashion."
