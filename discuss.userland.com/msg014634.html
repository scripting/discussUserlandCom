I just got an email from Julie McCarthy of National Public Radio asking where everyone was staying in Davos. It's gone. No kidding. Oy! Our apologies. These things always happen at the worst possible time.<p>

Fortune: <a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/fortune/careers/work/2000/01/24/">Even the webmaster can be replaced</a>. "If a programmer is indispensable, get rid of him as quickly as possible." <i>Amen.</i><p>

Another great quote from the Fortune piece: "A century ago worried telephone company executives calculated that everyone in America would have to become a telephone operator if Ma Bell scaled up to reach out and touch the nation.

Is it just me, or is it universally galling to <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,33759,00.html">point</a> at Wired now that Lycos has a pseudo-frame at the top of each page? Wired, like Netscape, is one of the emblems of the web. Lycos is an also-ran search engine. I'd prefer if it were the other way around.<p>

Man, I really <a href="http://whining.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$6">hate</a> the background color on that site.<p>

In the Wizard of Oz, the scarecrow wished he <a href="http://www.slonet.org/~rloomis/wizoz8.wav">only had a brain</a>. "Well what would you do with a brain if you had one?"<p>

I'm involved in an interesting discussion on the XML-DEV list which is being covered by the <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/eclectic/2000/01/20">Eclectic</a> weblog.<p>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/01/biztech/articles/20chip.html">NY Times on Transmeta</a>: "The company said its top-of-the-line chip, the TM5400, would have a clock speed of 700 MHz and would consume, on average, about one watt of power, far lower than today's low-power Intel chips, which can consume 10 watts or more. That chip is intended for subnotebook portable computers that run Microsoft's Windows operating system."<p>
