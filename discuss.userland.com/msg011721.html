MacWEEK: <a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/1999/10/03/developers.html">Scramble over OS 9 Conflicts</a>. "Sources said that Adobe, as well as other developers, have been relying on access the Mac OS's File Control Block (FCB) -- the system's method for tracking all open files -- and that Apple had made clear to developers its intent to change the structure of the FCB. In fact, sources said, Mac OS System Error 119 was created to flag this incursion." <i>Uh oh.</i><p>

John Dvorak: <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/smallbusiness/zdnet/article.html?s=/n/smallbiz/ecommerce/zdnet/199910030000">The Linux Myth</a>. "On a $199 machine, the OS can't cost more than a few bucks. Microsoft will have to shoot the OS cash cow if it wants to play. Microsoft won't be able to bundle its suites down there either, and it won't give Win CE away. So Microsoft's out of the picture. This new market has Linux written all over it. Get ready." <i>Exactly.</i><p>
