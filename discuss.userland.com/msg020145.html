Richard Stallman often enters the picture, because he is the author of the GPL. It is important that programmers and software users understand the motivations behind, and effects of, the GPL. The world needs to know how and why the GPL is crafted as it is, and why it is so damaging.
<P>
The response from Stallman which you cite above was part of a discussion in which Stallman's own words -- and sources which he cited as valid -- were used to demonstrate his malicious intent. His response amounts to saying, "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!"
