Does the table containing the newsToRss.xml script also contain a #members directive? I suspect that myUserlandSuite.registerChannel is being redirected to your site's logon page.<p>

<i>I read somewhere that "302" means a redirect, but as far as I can tell, it's not redirecting.</i><p>

Right. Following redirects is a rather new feature in tcp.httpClient and as far as I know the feature is not being used in the released version of myUserland.root.<p>

<i>Now... I do have config.mainresponder.domains.default pointing to another table, and "news" in that table points to news.root. Could this be a cause for my problems?</i><p>

I don't think so.
