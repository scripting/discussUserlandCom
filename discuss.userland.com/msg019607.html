Using MusicMatch & CDDB for "various artists" so far (just been doing this for a week).. <p>

 "VA","V.A.","Various","Various Artists"<p>

I think CDDB works "ok".  I have found errors... haven't looked at their service closely... is there a way to fix their errors for them?<p>

I like to have all the songs on an album in their own folder, regardless of the artist... the music match system gives crazy results when you have multiple artists on one album.  Other than that I think MusicMatch Jukebox (for Mac) is a cool program.
