That's a skewed question.<p>

Tim wasn't characterizing your involvement with RSS at all. He was characterizing your public statements about his (and his companies) involvement.<p>

His summary of your involvement with RSS, on the other hand, was devoid of any characterizations whatsoever.<p>

Regarding his characterization of your public statements: Yes, I think it's fair to say that you've been picking a fight here.<p>

Regarding his summarry of your involvement with RSS: No, I think that you and Userland were more deeply involved than he gives you credit for, but he also disclaims any privileged knowledge in that regard.<p>

An interesting definition of flaming that I heard once comes to mind: "Flaming is meta-conversation", or in other words, conversation <b>about</b> the conversation. Which tends to devolve into meta-meta-meta-conversation<p>

Examples:
<ul>
<li>Statements about the person who made a comment, rather than what they said.<p>

<li>Statements about how something was said, rather than what.<p>

<li>Statements about the motivations behind a statement, rather than its content.
</ul><p>

Note that these examples are not neccessarily all applicable to this particular situation, and I'm sure that other people can come up with additional examples.<p>

Also note that <b>BOTH</b> sides are engaged in flaming by this definition, and so am I.
