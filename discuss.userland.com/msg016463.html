I don't know if it's available yet, but the Coolpix 950 is being replaced by the 990--maybe you can find a dealer who will pre-sell one.  I've used a 900 and a 950, but I'm really salivating over the 990.  Details at <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com">http://www.nikonusa.com</a>.<p>

The 990 has faster USB interface instead of the serial/parallel, and some nice advances to the feature set.<p>

Also get a couple of extra 64 MB compact flash cards and a desktop card reader, or PC card adaptor if you have a notebook computer.
