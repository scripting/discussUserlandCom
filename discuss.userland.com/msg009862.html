If he had been caught, his life would not have been the same. True. He would have never been able to run for office, never owned the Texas Rangers, etc.<p>

If Clinton had his Monica indiscretion before being elected, would we have elected him? Would we have pryed? Don't know.<p>

Holding politicians to standards of conduct they are trying to impose on us, without our consent... that's an intriguing possibility.<p>

However I would prefer taking the position that if the government is trying to impose conduct on me that I oppose, particularly as in this case whether or not I use cocaine, a personal issue, rather than attempt to show them the wrong by treating them as they would treat me, I would treat them as I would wish to be treated.<p>

Two wrongs don't make a right, and do unto others.<p>

Whether my way or yours would be more effective, who knows. All I know  is I will be judging others as I would wish to be judged. If the government started shooting left-handed people, would you propose shooting all politicians who are left-handed? Aren't they the only politicians who you could reasonably hope would repeal such an outrageous law? Maybe having a man who has "been there, done that" will be helpful.<p>

There's always hope.
