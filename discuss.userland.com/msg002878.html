My understanding was that an empty string would be encoded as<p>

<pre><value><string></string></value></pre><p>

not<p>

<pre><value></value></pre><p>

In going back and re-reading the spec, I noticed the statement: "If no type is indicated, the type is string."  I will fix my decoder to match, but I think it's a false economy to not specify the types of all values.  In particular, since there are other places in the encoding where redundant information is given, like requiring <data> inside <array>, I see no reason to not be explicit in this case.  All it does is complicate XML-RPC decoders.<p>

I'm working in Python but writing an encoder/decoder in C.  Fredrik Lundh's works fine, but since it's based on an XML parser written entirely in Python, is too slow for my needs.  Fredrik has a faster parser available, but it seemed easier to me to rewrite a special-purpose coder since I already have similar C code available from a couple past efforts at serializing Python data structures. <p>
