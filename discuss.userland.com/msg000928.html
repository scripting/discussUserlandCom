God, that picture makes me laugh.  I miss those kids!<p>

To those that are curious, those are my students at Nakahara elementary school in Gifu prefecture, Japan.  The photo is from Dec 1995; the third graders in the picture will be entering Junior High school next April.<p>

It's such a trip that a program I goofed off with in my spare time in a little village in the mountains back in '95 would become such a large part of my life.  It's been a lot of fun working with Frontier and the Userland team, and I expect that this Frontier thing will keep rolling.<p>

Yeah!<p>

Phil :-)
