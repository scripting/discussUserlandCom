(I guess 
from the chats you are having with Dave, guess I need to follow the 
geneology of these ideas more closely, sorry Dave!)</p><p>

<p>I reminds me of the old Harvest architecture.  Harvest had a 
gatherer process, whose job was to run close to the content, digest 
it, and extract metadata.  Then a broker would point at multiple 
gatherers, indexing the content and perhaps adding some editorial 
value.</p><p>

<p>I really liked the architecture, for a number of reasons.  It 
never caught on enough for the idea of a value-adding broker to go 
very far, but I see the momentum Dave is generating for RSS as 
a progression of these ideas.  More importantly, he's actively 
describe a <i>platform vision</i> for rich, dispersed syndication 
that has the smell of success behind it.</p><p>

<p>It seems like this discussion is saying: don't make the protocol add all the value.  Leave room 
for people to jump in and do their thing.  Don't like my 
meta-taxonomy?  Use Dave's.  Think I have too much fluff in my 
channels?  Check out how Jon has filtered content.</p><p>

<p>We are working hard at putting a rich, smart, managed object between 
the content and the channel.  Who knows what we'll <i>do</i> with 
it, but it may provide a useful platform for experimenting with 
alternative models.</p>
