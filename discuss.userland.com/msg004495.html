Grab a copy of RedHat 5.2, and tell it to do the "Server" install.  It'll repartition your machine and install all the necessary stuff.  When it's done, Apache will be running.<p>

I just installed it at work, and it was up and running after about 30 minutes (I only needed to talk to it for about 5, the rest of the time it was busy installing all by itself).  It was simple.
