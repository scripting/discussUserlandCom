Subject: SANS FLASH For Outlook and Outlook Express Users; Please Fix This Before You Go Home Today<p>

<p>

Please Fix This Before You Go Home Today.<p>


And if you have gone home, go back to the office and fix it.<p>

<p>

Outlook and Outlook Express share a vulnerability that allows attackers
to run programs of their choice on your computer and all you have to do
is download email from the server. You don't have to open it or read
it.<p>

<p>

Microsoft posted a patch that eliminates this vulnerability at
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-043.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-043.asp</a>.<p>

<p>

SANS, Microsoft, and the FBI all suggest, as strongly as we can, that
you install this patch before leaving work today.<p>

<p>

Please go to the page and, if you are running an affected version (true
unless you have recently installed IE 5.01 Service Pack 1 or IE 5.5),
download the patch
