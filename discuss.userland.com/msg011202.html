as slashdot has already realized, if this scares you,
you're in for a big surprise.  a few observations:<p>

1) this is just another mail provider,
so these accounts have names like
'<a href="mailto:yourdoman@newdotcom.com">yourdoman@newdotcom.com</a>'.   and note
that if they hadn't made you this offer,
anyone could have grabbed a similar mail
address.<p>

2) there are thousands of free mail providers out there.
anyone can get himself a '<a href="mailto:yourdomain@someprovider.com">yourdomain@someprovider.com</a>'
address and read mail sent to that address.  if this
can cause trouble for you, you should either start
using PGP or something similar, or stay off the net.<p>

3) anyone with his own domain can of course do the
same.<p>

4) and finally anyone can masquerade as YOU simply by
reconfiguring their mailer -- sendmail doesn't care, and
according to the spec, it shouldn't.<p>

the NSI folks have surely goofed, but
calling this a "big security problem"
is to cry wolf.  if it was, the net
would have broken down years ago.
