Right. Artists never had a say in how their music is distributed, why should they have it now? Ultimately people have a say, by voting with their wallet. Piano rolls were more convenient than sheet music, and they in turn got replaced by 78RPM records, then by 45RPM records, then by 33RPM records, then by cassettes, then by CDs, then by MP3s, then by ... Why should it ever stop? It's just a matter of convenience, is all. And of acceptable quality. Most people can't hear the difference between a CD and a 128bps MP3 -- I certainly can't.<p>
