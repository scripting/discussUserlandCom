A personal statement is something like this: "Dave is a smelly fat Jewish guy with a loud mouth." Your message didn't say that, of course, it's just an example.<p>

The problem with statements like this is that it leaves the person with basically one of four responses.<p>

1. No I'm not. (Defensive.)<p>

2. You're right. (Self-hate.)<p>

3. You're an awful person. (Childish.)<p>

4. Say nothing. (Swallow the pain.)<p>

Even if I say nothing it encourages others to do it.<p>

Sometimes I let personal statements pass if there's other substance to the post. And I don't know why (should take a look at this) I let people make personal statements about RMS.<p>

But this thing betw me and Tim has been treated as a personality matter, and I find that abhorrent. I just don't want to host it. It could so easily flame out, and I find it hurtful. <p>

Anyway, thanks again for asking. As I said in the email, you can post it anywhere, but not in this space. (Or other DGs run by UserLand, so many lawyers!)
