But your data will live on! There is a MORE-to-Text translator available. It was announced on Scripting News on Jan 29, 1999.<p>

The translator will convert MORE files (I think from MORE II on) into tab-indented ASCII files. Easy to import those into Frontier, or (insert name of application that can read ASCII files here)... <p>
