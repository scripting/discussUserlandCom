I'm not talking about the antitrust case. I'm talking about developing software, specificly appliations built around an HTML rendering engine (browser-based apps from here on). <p>

<ul>
 <li>XUL doesn't let Windows developers do anything new, as we've been able to develop browser-based apps by dropping a WebBrowser ActiveX control in our apps since IE 3 came out.</li>
 <li>Not much has been done with this capability in the last few years, except Microsoft Money and the AOL Web Browser. My favorite text/HTML editor (<a href="http://www.editplus.com">EditPlus</a>) uses this capability to allow previewing web pages, but that's a $30 shareware program, not a higly profitable commercial application.</li>
 <li>Currently, Windows has about 90% of the desktop OS market.</li>
 <li>Therefore, expanding the capability to easily develop browser-based apps beyond the Windows platform will have a negligible effect on the spread of browser-based apps.</li>
</ul>
