The resume idea is cool, but I want this same sort of functionality for learning Frontier!<p>

Since the outline gives a clear visual heirarchy to what steps should be performed and when, how about the instructional steps for specific Frontier functions bundled in the database?  Then, if I have a problem, taking that outline online with a "Master Frontiersman" (Nirvanerd?) who helps me through the problem?  <p>

With both the "Frontiersman" and the user annotating the outline, Userland gets direct feedback for further engineering improvements, and the user gets results immediately, and has a documentary record for review (minimizing callbacks).  <p>

Your same idea, just turned a bit and aimed at Frontier, or instructional purposes in general. Or getting rid of those miserable help lines that we all end up spinning our wheels in?<p>

To underline the major concept from your last paragraph: tutorials are fine, but gleaning experiential advice and having a knowledgeable individual help a user walk-through a specific function will always be a much more compelling instructional experience.<p>

Keep the ideas flowing, folks! Don't make Bernie do all the work ...
