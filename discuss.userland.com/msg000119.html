to the discussion list (and if there are more
than one list, to the contents of the discussion
groups as well).
 
If you are now reading a list of messages
it takes a while to come back to the
list by pressing the "back" button.<p>

It would also be nice to have a CC option,
sending the entry also to your own mailbox.<p>

Finally, it would be cool if you could
automatically receive the response to
your entry if somebody posted a message
in response to your entry.<p>

Now I am waiting for the "How to" on
your web server
