Thanks for the pointer.<p>

So it sounds like some folks getting together in the spirit of open source to create a toolset that does what the big boys (Thawte, RSA) do.  Sounds neat.  It's a little out of my league as far as programming.<p>

I'd be interested in this from a perspective of a person who wants to run a business and have secure web servers, and perhaps save some buks.  With a little work, it looks like users could accept certificates from OpenCA.  I'm assuming this is because the big browsers don't currently include OpenCA's certificate authority by default.<p>

VeriSign certificate prices were not outrageous but not at a price that didn't make me think twice! :-)  Thawte at about $125 doesn't look bad at all.  Of course, free could be very attractive! :-)  But I'm concerned about the amount of configuration users would have to do to use OpenCA.
