Between your server and the client there usually is a WAP Gateway (there are some in development, we are using a beta of Nokia's one) that bridges the gap between http and your (usually wireless) device.<p>

So it's:<p>

HTTP -> Wap Gateway ->[wireless connection]-> Cellphone/PDA<p>

The problem seems to be that not all WAP Gateways work with al WAP devices: the Nokia gateway works well with Nokia cellphones but not with other brands.
