It's been stigmatized, more by it's association with other illegal drugs than on it's own merits (or lack there of).<p>

It's worth knowing that Carl Sagan used it, because it might help to defeat people's pre-conceived notions of it.<p>

I personally benefited greatly from the use of Marijuana medicinally during chemotherapy treatment, and wish I didn't have to go through illegal channels to do it.  My own doctors at the National Cancer Institute more or less said "we can't recommend you use it--but we sure hear it works and wish we could research it."<p>

If knowing some respected people in our society used Marijuana and didn't end up destitute crack heads helps shake some people awake to it's possible values, then it's important.<p>

It still may not "prove" anything, but it is important.<p>
