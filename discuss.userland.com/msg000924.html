If your program doesn't require any non-ANSI features, you can use almost any set of tools to develop it, on any type of computer.<p>

If you write POSIX code (a superset of ANSI C), you'll probably need a Unix box. POSIX code will also run under NT, but you need to settle for an older, less complete version of POSIX or buy expensive add-on packs from third parties.<p>

Our server application runs on big Digital Unix systems, but I develop under Linux (which is much cheaper). We did an internal Linux port just to save the cost of one high-end workstation. =)
