Them talking about it publicly like that is so clueless, it makes you want to laugh. Like, "We're not sure if we're under a DoS attack, would you <i>please</i> try to see if you can get to our web site from your web browser? Thanks!". By publicizing the attack they're asking the net at large to participate, join the party! If they weren't being slash-dotted previously by hackers, now they are for sure, by Jo Random Surfer.<p>

Clueless. Hopeless. Like dinosaurs waiting for the meteorite to hit.
