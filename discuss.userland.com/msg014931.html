It's the engine behind the growth of Yahoo. And while the web browser is a very limited user interface environment, it's not so limited that you can't build a powerful easy to use publishing system around it, as we have."</blockquote><p>

The ironic thing is, no one has done more for the potential of web apps (/network computing) than Microsoft. The browser interface environment is actually not limited whatsoever -- if you're using MS's latest, IE5. Most people have no idea what's possible with it (yet). You can deliver web apps with interfaces that are virtually identical in look and feel to the richest client-installed applications.<p>
