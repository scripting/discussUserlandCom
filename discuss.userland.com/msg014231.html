Here is a link.  <a href="http://lynn.editthispage.com/">http://lynn.editthispage.com/</a><p>

I use Opera and when I view this page, Opera downloads the information from the picture, but doesn't display the picture.  I found out that the server is sending an "image/pjpeg" MIME type.  Generally this isn't a problem, since most places will send a filename, and Opera can pick up the correct format by the extension, but the "picture$x" format of refrencing the pictures is causing problems sometimes.  <p>

The link to the picture on Lynn's site <a href="http://lynn.editthispage.com/picture$4">http://lynn.editthispage.com/picture$4</a> displays nothing for me.<p>

A similarly formed link from Steve Miner's site, <a href="http://miner.editthispage.com/picture$5">http://miner.editthispage.com/picture$5</a>, does display the picture correctly.<p>

In both cases, if I download the picture file and view it with a seperate program, it works, so all the data is getting over.  Just the MIME type is messed up.  <p>

Can anyone else verify this?  Netscape and IE both can view this.  Does my browser just trust in MIME too much?
