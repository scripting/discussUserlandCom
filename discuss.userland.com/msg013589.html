An immediate shortcoming that I have noticed is that people tend to stay with like-minded people (see <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">slashdot</a>) and not stray too far from their point of view. Also, you can never tell (really well) if the people you want to read your comments actually do - it's pretty easy for anyone to (conveniently) ignore others' POV.<p>

(quick survey: how many people saw what I wrote on <a href="http://misnomer.editthispage.com">misnomer</a> about this?)<p>

In discussion groups, there is a common space so that both parties have to come halfway.<p>

OTOH, DG's don't always work this way: people lack the civility to work together on a common ground. Each person working in their own space can be a good thing, but alienation is even easier. Is the individual site medium better at this because people don't have their readership guaranteed?<p>

Jimi just answered: "soon enough, time will tell"<p>

I find that in any medium, sincerity is a prerequisite for getting anything done (long term).<p>

One reasonable conclusion: belittling people or insulting them is counterproductive.<p>

optimistically,<p>
