<blockquote><i>Unix needs a desktop, not two or five.  It needs one,
one that has the polish and finish of Windows or Macintosh, and has
the support of tool and runtime software developers.  To gain that
support, one of the desktop metaphors for Unix has to jump out in
front of all of the others, to become the "consensus platform" and
then, and only then, can Unix *start* to challenge Windows and
Macintosh on the desktop.</i></blockquote><p>

It's going to be a few years before this happens and it may not be the
way one might expect.  None of Gnome, KDE, GNUStep, or any of a myriad
other desktop projects will jump in front of all the others.  Not only
do they each have their strengths and weaknesses, followers and
detractors, but to standardize on one implies a lack of ongoing
development on new metaphors (a large number of seemingly incremental
UI improvements come from a deep rethinking of the underlying
architecture).<p>

What is more likely to happen over the next few years is that
consensus will be gained on how 80% of the user interface should be
implemented consistently and replaceably, and each desktop project
will have a plug-in that emulates the look-and-feel of the other
leading desktops.  This will allow a individual user or an
organization to standardize on a look and feel while still keeping the
ongoing development of new metaphors wide open.  A preview of this
ability is how Gnome (and KDE?) support ``themes'': a skin-deep change
of your desktop's look.  The next step is to support themes that can
actually modify your desktop's feel, so your desktop can look
<b>and</b> feel the way you choose.<p>

The other 20% of user interface are the things that individual
application developers need specifically in their own applications.
Having multiple desktop libraries to choose from allows developers to
choose the one that provides the most added value to their application
while still maintaining at least visual compatibility through themes.<p>

KDE and Gnome are the leading modern GUI toolkits on Unix today.
Choosing one or the other, based on their individual merits today,
does not exclude a user from using applications from <i>any</i> other
desktop toolkit, it just makes the desktop seem somewhat
schizophrenic.  Choosing <i>either</i> KDE or Gnome today will most
likely lead effortlessly to being part of the ``consensus platform''
that is developing among Unix GUIs already.
