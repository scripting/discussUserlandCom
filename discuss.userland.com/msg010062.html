Opening a url that ends in .png will load perfectly, but png's in <img&gt; tags will not work.</i><p>

I've done a little more research since my last post. "Loads perfectly" well, sort of... after manually entered the suffix & mime type into my IE preferences. Yes, I can now see stand alone PNG's.<p>

<i>I stand corrected, I saw it work on some pages - I never looked at the code until you questioned me. Also, I'm using 4.01, but I doubt there's a difference in 4.5</i><p>

I wonder if there is a difference, if yours was able to view them out of the box but I had to go through the convoluted setup deal. Your average surfer doesn't know much about MIME types.<p>

But not handling PNG's as valid types for IMG means that none of the test suites <a href="http://www.hensa.ac.uk/png/images/suite/all.html">here</a> or <a href="http://www.hensa.ac.uk/png/images/suite/allrec.html">here</a> work--bummer!
