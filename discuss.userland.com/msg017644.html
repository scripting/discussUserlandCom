Final judgement is in. Damn, guilty verdict has been in for 60 days.<p>

MS wants two mutually exclusive things, "we do not want governement oversight, and we do not want to be split up" For some reason, they don't understand why they can't have both. And the court does not want to be overseeing MS's every move (and every complaining competitor, and MS appeals when things don't go it's way). How will your proposal handle this?<p>

One thing, MS should not be allowed to embrace and extend (and extinguish). That behavior still goes on, as is evidenced by the keberos controversy last month. <p>

And that embrace and extend policy is where the crediilibity problem exists. Promise one thing, and deliver another.<p>


MS is really in the nile.
MS went in saying it would win. Now, it says it it will win on appeal. <p>

The only thing constant is that MS says that they integrated the browser properly. They did win an early appeal on this, but the biggest problem with this is that that is only part of the problem, and the part that got them dragged into court. But that was only part of thier problem.<p>

So they win the appeal and they courts say that they should have never been dragged in because of the browser. What about the other evidence? OEM's, developers and all the others. The DOJ can bring the case on a different charge. The world may be much differnt<p>

Dave, how does one know what the web wants? <br>
Is the web the companies who develop for the web?<br> 
is the web the people who sell products over the internet?<br>
Is it the ISP's and backbones who connect the internet?<br>
Is it the people who log onto the internet?<br>
