What you would get then, is a completely separate view of the outline for end-users and the technographer. If you don't want the users to see the subheadings, turn on the comment flag, (Ctrl-backslash or Command-backslash depending on your OS), and then the renderer won't show those sub-headings to users, though the technographer could still see them, and edit them.<p>

I've made a sample renderer and put it up at<p>

It might not be the best name for it, but oh well. Please let me know if it proves useful to anyone. Also, it would be trivial to add a comment truncator which would chop off the tails of lines at a comment mark, so the technographer could keep private information in the same outline all the users see...<p>

<i>P.S. I went ahead and added this feature, but the lines that do it are commented-out. Uncomment them if you want this feature. In the long run, I guess it's better to use a directive to tell the renderer what to do, but I didn't want to have to remember yet another custom directive.</i>
