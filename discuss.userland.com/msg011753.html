How are you an expert on copyright?<p>

A case could be made, but it have a really chilling effect on free speech if I can't reference _anything_ without permission from the publishers. That's not the way copyright works.

You yanked my statement out of context and then misrepresented it.  The original <A HREF="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11112">formulation</A>, in which a magazine distributor was widely distributing <I>modified</I> representations, not just <I>referencing</I> them, is indeed illegal and it doesn't take an "expert" on copyright to see that, it just what it is.  <p>

<I>Referencing</I> has nothing to do with <I>modifying</I>.
