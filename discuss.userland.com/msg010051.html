That's because the Quicktime plug-in handles it. Since IE has been pre-installed on every system since 7.6, it is pre-installed with the quicktime plug-in.<p>

so unless someone does a clean insatll of the system and selectively chooses not to install IE, and then later installs it, IE 4.x on the Mac does PNG.</i><p>

Except that it doesn't. The QT plug-in does *not* handle PNG's for IE 4.5, at least. Not on this machine (OS 8.6, IE 4.5, QT plug-in 4.02) or any other I've seen.<p>

This is documented at the page I referenced in my last message, the list of <a href="http://www.hensa.ac.uk/png/home/pngapbr.html">PNG-supporting browsers</a>.<p>

Now if you can document your statement that it works in real world situations, I'd appreciate a reference. Or at least an explanation of how to get it to work on *my* machine.
