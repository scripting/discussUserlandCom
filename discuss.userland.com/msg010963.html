I'm curious if there are other people out there who have found non-internet uses for Frontier, and what they are.<p>

I got into Frontier just about when the html rendering stuff was begining to happen. I found it at random by doing a search on some website or another, I don't remember which, because I was looking for a way to make my computer check my email in the middle of the night when the phones were cheaper. (I was living in Amsterdam, and working with a <a href="http://jake.sonic.com/band/listen/">band</a>, and I was making very little money, so this was important.)<p>

Anyway, AppleScript English looked like Greek to me ;-> and UserTalk was much like Pascal or AmigaBasic (also much like Pascal), which made much more sense to me, and it knew how to talk to all the apps I wanted to talk to.<p>

Nowadays, I use the free version of Frontier at my office to drive all our software builds, on both Mac and Windows. It's got a web-based interface available on our intranet, and it sends email notifications when it works, and error messages when it doesn't.<p>

I've used it to send emails to developers when a bug has been regressed, closed, opened, or updated. People can basically subscribe to this service, which talks to our bug database in FileMaker.<p>

I use it to drive our applications to do repetitive types of matrix testing. It parses reports, and generates scripts to drive our MPEG encoder app.<p>

My boss loves what I've done with Fronteir so much that when they put an ad for a <a href="http://www.sonic.com/html/employment/#12317">position in QA</a> up on our website, Frontier was one of the items listed under skills and experience. My Sonic coffee mug reads "Script-Ninja".<p>

BTW, (heads up Userland) the QA manager here was interested in training or classes in Frontier. As far as I know there is no such class or seminar. There's an opportunity for Userland (or others?) to make some $$$ here. It's interesting to consider having classes and certification for Frontier. It gives credibility to both Userland, and the people who use Frontier in professional/corporate environments. Userland could probably charge at least $2,500 for five days of training, which should be more than enough to pay a new hire to do it...
