I don't follow this logic.<p>

Here's the way that I see it:
1. Infoworld, until recently, required permission for people to link to their content. <p>

2. People thought that was absurd. The very nature of the web is that you can link everywhere and it's one of the great strengths of the web.<p>

3. Much lobbying and discussion ensued, Infoworld changed their policy to more accurately reflect the general nature of the web vs. the real world. The net result is that a person can now link to Infoworld's stories.<p>

4. Now, we learn that there are autmated tools, scrapers, that are linking to content without author's permissions. It's not stealing the actual content, just the title (a link) and maybe creating a short summarization.<p>

5. Why would someone object? Isn't this the same thing as linking to an infoworld story except that it's being done automatically?<p>

Is the point here that an individual linking to specific stories is okay but the line doesn't extend to the point that an automated agent linking to a bunch of stories isn't okay?<p>

Don't. :-) </i></blockquote><p>

Heh, reminds me of a parent answering their child's question by saying, "Because...", which always seemed like weak logic when growing up.<p>

Please, go back to my previous post and help me understand the difference between this issue and the real world services of a news clipping organization.</blockquote>
