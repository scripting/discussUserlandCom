A book is too intimidating. I tried giving a friend a Peachpit book on HTML - all those pages intimidated her. You won't find a simpler book on learning HTML.<p>

<p>
So I wrote the code for a simple web page on the back of a napkin. Then she "saw" just how simple it really is.<p>

<p>
Now she has a web site.<p>

<p>
But Notepad, ftp, etc. are still too intimidating. Next step is to turn her site into a Zope site so all she has to do is use her browser.</p></p></p></p>
