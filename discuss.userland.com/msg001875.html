LOL! We will see these people. Want to make a bet how long it'll take?<p>

OTOH, your comment about owning the home is a good one. I suppose anything that gets more Macs into more homes is a *good* thing, assuming Uncle Steve wants to share. They control the Mac market so thoroughly, not just thru culture, but thru the lock-down on hardware distribution, much more so than Microsoft. No one contests their right to ship exactly what bits they want to on the hard disks of their systems. Microsoft is in court right now over exactly that.<p>

Now, in your position, even this might be a good thing, why should you care what bits appear on all the desktops? Maybe I shouldn't care either. I just don't think the Mac is a very open platform for software developers. Or it's too subject to the whims of the platform vendor. Maybe you could say the same thing about Frontier. Who knows.<p>

Let's get our jobs done. I won't worry too much about the Mac, and hope for the best.
