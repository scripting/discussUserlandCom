Another fun idea...<p>

Does anyone know what the request headers of a Third Voice user look like?  Is there anything that can be recognized?  Like specific ip's, ports, useragents, or anything? They could get their own special content. Dynamic websites can be fun that way. ;><p>

I've got something in mind along the lines of the alt.slack distributed parody archive.  It's not nice, but it can be surprisingly amusing and effective.<p>
