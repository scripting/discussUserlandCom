1. Frontier's web server is on.<p>

2. then if you change TCP sources, (ie, change from a LAN connection to dialup), and the connection gets severed ( the modem drops),
Frontier will put up a modal dialog that says "Out of Memory."<p>

3. You press the ok button, and it comes up again and again and again.  It's not possible to switch to another application. The only way to escape is a force-quit of Frontier.<p>

That's what happens.
