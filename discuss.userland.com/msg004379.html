I now get an Access Forbidden message! And it looks like InterNic has completely redone their site.<p>

I'm left bewildered -- the site may have had flaws, but I learned how to use it over time, and now it's changed, and I don't know how to use it. It's as if someone came in, without my knowledge, and upgraded one of my core apps to a new, completely unrecognizable version. I bet I'm not alone in being a little pissed about it.
