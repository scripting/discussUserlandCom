I just think that MS improved the player because of competition.<p>

 2) As an improvement due to competition<br><p>

If MS portrayed it as "innovation" would it be honest.<p>

PS. Cleartype was making old technology, new techology with a lot of marketing hype. The only thing new was that it was designed for LCD screens.
