It was the leading Videotex system. The French one (Minitel?) came next. I thought we were working on videotex authoring software, this was ThinkTank. I went to NY a lot to demo the software to companies like CBS and Dow Jones who were thinking about doing the same thing as the British and the French. That's why I called my company Living Videotext. (I named it while it was still a big controversy over whether there was a T at the end or not.)<p>
