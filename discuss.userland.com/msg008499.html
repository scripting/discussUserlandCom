First, it may not apply to the collaborative model that Dave's building but when I suggested not including links that had already appeared in other popular web logs, my readers told me firmly that they want duplication where I think an item is important, that they're interested in my editorial voice and why I think a given story is interesting.<p>

On the second paragraph, I think people prefer the text as well, it's just that because I've gotten very little feedback from people using syndication (and because the collaborative model causes problems with that strong editorial voice which my readers have told me they want) writing the scripts to provide the Userland or Whump XML formats rather than the MyNetscape format just hasn't trickled up the queue. And the MyNetscape format only allows for links.
