Well that's quite simple to distinguish
It's a <font color="red"><b>Brain Reserves Sharing Protocol</b></font> or <b><font color="red">BRSP</font></b><p>

Let's explain. (I used m-w.com to infer these terms) <p>

<b><font color="red">Brain </font></b>can be defined as duh... You know what Brain is. Let's just say Intellect, Mind, Wisdom, Thought and all that jazz.<p>

<b><font color="red">Reserve</font></b> can be defined as setting something aside, someting stored and available for the future, a free expression of one's mind. <p>

<b><font color="red">Sharing </font></b>can be defined as someting you experience, enjoy with others, or have in common. Sharing requires at least two people. It's an act of participation in a conversation. "SHARE usually implies that one as the original holder grants to another the partial use, enjoyment, or possession of a thing"<p>

<font color="red"><b>Protocol </b></font>can be defined as a set of conventions governing the method of sharing One's Brain Reserves.<p>

So there you have it. <font color="red"><b>Brain Reserves Sharing Protocol</b></font><p>

So it's a quantity of Brain Reserves accumulated at one place and accessible by other Brain Reserves with a freedom of sharing the reserves by means of a specific protocol. We can freely share and experience Other People's Brain Reserves and add to those reserves freely. And at the same time we open our own Brain Reserves to others.<p>

What do you think about that?
