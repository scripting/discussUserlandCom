What I don't understand is what is the reason for this crisis. And I don't know how to go about finding out the answers to my questions (below) since I haven't seen any good discussions on the web or news about this topic:<p>

* Are we consuming too much oil, like, much more than last year this time and there isn't enough supply capacity?<br>
* Or is there a genuine problem with oil supplies dwindling and demand rising?<br>
* Or is there some secret war that we don't hear about that's causing supply problems?<br>
* Or maybe we're being held hostage by OPEC?<br>
* Or maybe it's just greed on the part of the big oil companies?<br>
* Or even more bizarre, maybe its a Republican scheme to make the Demos look bad? The major oil companies certainly are not friendly to the Demos and some of them are based in Texas (hint hint)..<p>

How would you use the web to find some answers to these questions? What's the *true* story here?
