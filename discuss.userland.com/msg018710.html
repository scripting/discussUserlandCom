pictures from the rollout the first time I saw them.  I
thought about how the notion that "the camera doesn't lie"
is complete bunk.  Given a videotape of an event, I could
excerpt a still that supported almost any given message I
wanted to convey.<p>

What do I see?  I know Bill is the alpha male in this group,
but he looks so squirrelly and weird, I'm wondering how that
can be.  Ballmer looks like top dog.<p>

I hadn't seen Beluzzo (<i>not</i> Paluzzo :-) clean-shaven
before, so that was interesting.  He looks "whipped."
The other two guys looked cowed, or bored, or busy thinking
about what <i>they'll</i> say when it's their turn...<p>

Responsible journalism can offer us more than a shot
at misinterpreting a hundredth of a second of body language.
Part of "responsible" is making one's biases known.  I think
you do a good job of that, Dave.  Maybe the ZDNet guy does,
too, but from the one piece of his I've read, he seems to
think he's got a special line on objective truth as a
"professional."  That's more dangerous than a writer with a
measureable slant.<p>

The power of captioning is substantial, as well: the picture
may give an immediate impression, but a caption can almost
bend it to the writer's slant.<p>

The attendees, and especially the photographer, have a much
larger context to interpret the still.  Even with subjective
biases, they can provide a more honest caption, I'd think,
than what strikes me as a remote viewer.<p>

Am I in my head here, out of the game?  Maybe so.<p>

But think of it in terms of <b>Finite and Infinite Games</b>.
The infinite game is finding authenticity, and expressing it
in what you do and who you are, such that stills are not
subject to misinterpretation.  By that measure, the five
9-, 10- and 11-figure white guys suggests they've got a ways to
go.<p>

Think pictures of the Dalai Lama.  Think this picture:
