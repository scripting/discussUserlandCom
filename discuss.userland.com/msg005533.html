My goal is to have hits to mR saved out to a text file in common log format for analysis by Summary <<a href="http://summary.net/summary.html">http://summary.net/summary.html</a>>.<p>

I've been tinkering with extending logbrowser.root to handle this task.  I've gotten pretty far along.  Unfortunately it looks like mR doesn't store some information that a clf would need.  It's not storing if the request was a GET, PUT, or etc.  Also, it's not storing the HTTP version.<p>

After diggin' around a bit it looks like my only option at this point is to alter mainResponder.log.add to grab the additional information.<p>

What I'm hoping for is that there is a way to accomplish what I want without doing that.  Some callback I may have missed?  I just looked over the mR docs on frontier.userland.com. Nothing seems to fit the bill.  mainResponder.log.add is called at the very last in mainResponder.respond so I can't see a way to patch into the logging process.<p>

If it is indeed the case that there is currently no callback mechanism for mR logging, I like to request that one be added please.  That way I could log any extra information that I might need in addition to the basic items Userland stores.<p>

I can see in the future wanting to create other log file formats.<p>

Thanks much,<p>
