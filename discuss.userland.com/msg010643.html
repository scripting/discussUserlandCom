Does that include the mental effort needed to sort through a year's accreted email? Because that's when things get interesting.<p>

(five years of having a 15Mb total quota on a UNIX shell account teaches you to filter and clean your mailboxes, I suppose. It may also be a consequence of living in a small country...)<p>

But as for databases: what sort of paradigm are you looking for? Because when it comes to scanning email folders for relevance checks, I've not found anything nicer than the MIT Remembrance Agent:<p>
