We want to see a common way to build networks out of mixed content systems, such as PHP, ASP, Cold Fusion, Zope. The reason we're taking a leadership role is that we want Frontier to be an important part of those environments. As we move forward, <i>every</i> link in our chain is openly specified. Today we have publicly explained how another of our links works. Competition is welcome. If there's a reason this spec won't work in an environment you use or have created, please get involved. <p>

This in an incredible screw-up, the analysts are proclaiming DNA as a Windows-only thing, when SOAP, if it were at the core of Microsoft's plans (is it?), makes it completely non-Windows-centered. So much confusion!<p>
