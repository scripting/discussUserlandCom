I started with "Jacob Levy", and kept entering the answer as the next input. Eventually it entered an infinite loop over three names: "Bastard, BASTARD Fanatical Killer" goes to "Fat-Assed BeatMaster" which leads to "Drug-Addled Fishlip" which loops back to "Bastard, BASTARD Fanatical Killer"..<p>

Just thought you'd all like to know.. :) Did anyone else observe infinite loops emanating from their RL names?
