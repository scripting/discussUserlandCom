I posted a script that I though could help you. Its a CGI but I didn't put any comments in it. Sorry for that too. So here's it is again with some explanations.<p>

Just replace "thePathToTheApacheLog" with the path to your Apache Log, save the file as readable and executable by others in your cgi-bin repertory and then go with your browser to www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/thisScript.cgi.<p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -T<p>

# On the shebang line (the line above) I use the -T check.
# This let Perl check that the script will not do anything dangerous.
# Using backticks can be very dangerous but not here AFAIK.
# I had the following line because of -T check.
# For more details, see: <a href="http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/wwwsf5.html">http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/wwwsf5.html</a> 
$ENV&#123;'PATH'&#125; = '/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin';<p>

# I'm using here the CGI.pm module
# For more details see: <a href="http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/CGI/">http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/CGI/</a>
use CGI ':standard';<p>

# If there is an error in the script, it will be logged in the browser window.
use CGI::Carp(fatalsToBrowser);<p>

# Ensure that you declare each variable and use safe construction.
use strict;<p>

# Each declaration of a variable have to start with "my" the first time it appears
# in the script.
# To make a system call and get the result in a variable you use backticks.
# Perl provide que <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/qx//">qx//</a> shortcut that you can use instead of the backticks.
# Here, the result is read in the array @s
my @s = qx/tail thePathToTheApacheLog/;<p>

# HTML stuff that CGI.pm do for you.
print header;
print start_html (-title=>'Tail', -bgcolor=> 'white');
print h1("This a the tail of ...");<p>

# We print every line in the array @s using the magic variable $_ (its the default
# input or output).
foreach (@s) &#123;
	print "$_<br>";
&#125;<p>

# Close the HTML file
print end_html;<p>
