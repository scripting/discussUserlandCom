Usually as "I'd rather use XML-RPC because no two implementations of SOAP can talk to each other."<p>

Sure, little was mentioned in the sessions, but who goes to conferences for the sessions? I went to sit in the bar and talk to people, to go to the BOFs and track down the interesting hecklers, find the wild-eyed ravers in the hallways and listen for the insights amongst the madness. Yeah, there's an occasional Damian Conway talk that's worthwhile, but...<p>

As for why there was little discussion of the Dot-Net stuff, it's 'cause nobody cared to use the name given to the concept by some Johnny-come-lately who's been shown to not play well with others in the past. From what I can puzzle out from the marketing hype, Dot-Net is what Mozilla is being built for, what Cam's been doing for Alphanumerica, it's what you and the other XML-RPC hackers have been doing, it's what people are playing with in wireless applications.
