It's not working, principally because you write many more words than I do, and I disagree with nearly all your representations of my position.  Thus I waste a lot of time addressing red herrings.<p>

Developers have the power to make money.  They most certainly do not have the power to set corporate agendas, except in rare cases.  I did not claim what you say I did, so it's singularly unfortunate that now I am dishonest because of your imagination.
