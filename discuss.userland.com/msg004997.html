Many things work, but when I go to the main entrypoint for the DG (#url = discussHomepage, which I've tried both htmlInterfaces/ and my cloned copy of that), I get the following error:<p>

"Can't get the first day in the calendar because adrcalendar doesn't point to a valid non-empty calendar structure. "<p>

Oddly, no one else talks about getting this error. How does one get the calendar ball rolling? Must you intialize a DG a certain specific way?<p>

When I do the newTopic page, I can enter a topic and that works. 
The response works too. But then going to list topics, I get the error "Can't find a sub-table named item#1."
