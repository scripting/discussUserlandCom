As described in The Register's <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/990901-000011.html">Apple's Power Mac G4: a tale of two boxes</a>, the machine that's available today is the one that was code-named "Yikes!", which is basically a G3 motherboard with a G4 plunked into it (and a new skin).<p>

"Sawtooth", which is the motherboard with the faster RAM access, faster PCI bus, even more accellerated video (AGP 2x), etc, is the one that's delayed until September/October.<p>

My personal opinion is that "Yikes!" is useful for developers who want a real G4 to play with and develop on, but most people will be better served by waiting for "Sawtooth".<p>
