I found this lame page on MSNBC:<p>

<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/303147.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/news/303147.asp</a><p>

Arghh!, page space is basically free on the web, yet they still revert to the old newpaper format that was devised to save space. Why can't they put this data into a table?<p>

(Plus I'm little annoyed that it took me a while to find this page in the first place, but an article on drug abuse in Track and Field was very easy to find...)<p>

Can anyone point me to a decent sports website? I'd like to follow the games this week (I know a fair number of the people who are the US team).
