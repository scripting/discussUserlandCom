Anyway Frontier isn't even remotely in that league, at this time. We can do 50-100K hits per day comfortably. But it's not in the millions. This is one of the reasons we position Frontier 6 as a "workgroup web server". It can handle workgroups at least as large as UserLand.Com. And that's also why we're interested in dynamic connections to other deployment systems, so we can have a big scaling jump for Frontier-managed content as we continue to optimize Frontier for running higher-traffic sites.<p>

Anyway, it's funny this should come up today. I just got thru writing the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$496">specification</a> for Preferences flow thru XML-RPC. We have this deployed here and it's working really well.
