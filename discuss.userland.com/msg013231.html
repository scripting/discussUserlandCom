Sort of. The difference between the two is that while a unix system has only one root account, a NT box can be set up with any number of users in the Administrator group. If you go into Start->Programs->Administrative Tools->User Manager you will see a list of all the user groups and their privileges. Here's where you can setup an account for yourself and if you assign yourself to the Administrator group you'll be able to do everything you can do if you login as Administrator.<p>

I hope this answers your question.
