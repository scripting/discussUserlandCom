It's important for me to know this, because I run a web server on my desktop machine. It's an essential part of my workflow. <p>

I think, but I don't know for sure, that MSIMC grabs port 80 if it's available when it launches. At least it (appears to) give it up when it quits.<p>

Still checking this out. Any information is appreciated.
