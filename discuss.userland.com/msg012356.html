I was just trying to review some of yesterday's posts, and I'm unable to do so. When I click on the calendar to the right to get a previous day's messages (any day, as far as I can tell), I get that day's URL in my address box (<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/$1999/10/23">http://discuss.userland.com/$1999/10/23</a> , for example), but I get today's (10/26) posts. To make sure that this wasn't a browser issue, I telneted into another account and viewed discuss.userland.com with lynx, and got the same result.<p>

Hope you don't mind me putting this here; I figured it was the fastest way to let you know...
