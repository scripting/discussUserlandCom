No, I didn't miss the message. And I tried to spell that out early in my message.<p>

To clarify: I think it's great that you're using your powers for good. I think it's sad that you have to use your powers in the first place. [does an implied "all-negating but" count?]<p>

<i>So don't get weepy (a Jason Levine term) -- think positive.</i><p>

I do think positive. What you're doing may help to improve customer service at PC manufacturers in general (by improving it at one, who hopefully will lead by example). I sure hope it does.<p>

<b>But,</b> I still have some sadness over the fact that there are too many businesses that are unresponsive to their customers. I probably went on too long trying to figure out why, but the fact remains that I think it would be a better world if it didn't take the power of DaveNet to get decent service from a business.<p>
