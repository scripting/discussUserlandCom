Macintosh APIs will be there with Mac OS X, in a modernized form.  Current Macintosh applications cannot be run natively on a preemptively-multitasked memory-protected operating system without some porting (or a complete MacOS 8.x virtual machine), simply because of the way the Toolbox is structured.  Carbon seems like a great value proposition.<p>

As a developer, while Apple's silence on features and a lack of developer releases has annoyed me, I understand and accept their reasons and am willing to forgive them now that I can order it.  And they never made me feel my applications weren't welcome.<p>

And as an owner of a pair of NeXTstations, I can say that the Mac OS X Server development environment has me realy excited.  I look forward to being able to get paid to do work in it.
