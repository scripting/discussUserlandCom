Dave, take the train to Italy. Find a spot with a clean window and keep your camera ready. Passing through the mountains of Germany, Switzerland, and Italy is simply awe-inspiring.<p>

Wherever you go in Italy, you will fall in love. With the scenery, with the history, with the food, especially with the coffee, and most definately with the women.<p>

But not with the taxi drivers.<p>
