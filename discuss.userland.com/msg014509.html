It used to be that most of the buying and selling took place on Usenet, a reasonably efficient market place, but occasionally a startling inefficient market place. (Efficient in economic terms, where the value of an object is known and agreed upon)<p>

It was the inefficiencies that I liked. In areas that I knew well, a bargain (by definition, an inefficiency, since if the market could bear a higher price without changing the time on the market, that price should have been known by the seller) could be spotted and acted on quickly. I have bought many bike parts at well below 'fair market' value with this system. And it was a handy way to get rid of parts _quickly_ if I didn't want something. <p>

Ebay has basically killed this barter. From an economic standpoint, auctions are a more effecient mechanisim, but given the publicity and the search tools, it's far harder to be the most knowlegable buyer for a particular item. <p>
