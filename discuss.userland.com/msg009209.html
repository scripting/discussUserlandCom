Who is ahead in the browser market? Microsoft.<p>

Who has the best opportunity to integrate browsers and IM? Microsoft.<p>

Who has the best chance to integrate IM-enabled browsers and IM-enabled web servers? Microsoft.<p>

Who is the platform king-of-the-hill on the client side? Microsoft.<p>

Who is the wannabe-king on the server side? Microsoft.<p>

My conjecture: Microsoft is aiming to use IM as another wedge to crack the corporate server market. Imagine a corporate buyer that's planning to put up a web server for their e-commerce, customer support and product info site. One sofware company offers them a web server that is integrated with the market leading IM-capable web browser, enabling the vendor to respond to interest in their product *in real time* rather than later, by analyzing web logs. Another software company offers a web server that does not work at all or well with the dominant IM-enabled browser but it does have very fancy logs and analysis tools.<p>

Which server solution would you choose?<p>

Who is the first software company (offering the integrated solution)? Microsoft.<p>

Who is the second software company (offering the IM-integration-defficient solution)? AOL/Netscape.<p>

Of course, the first software company (Microsoft) also wants to force you to use NT server. Oh well...<p>

Also of course, it doesn't have to play out this way. AOL/Netscape can use its head-start on the stand-alone IM client side to make a convincing end-run on the server market. However, IMHO the offerings from Netscape in the server market have not yet been compelling.<p>

Am I full of it or is this a reasonable scenario?
