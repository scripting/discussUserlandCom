However, I have friends who are not very experienced with computers, and they're always getting these viruses and transmitting them.<p>

I tell them that I never open the enclosures they send me. I try to explain that this isn't because I don't like them, but because I don't want to get viruses on my machine.<p>

Yet I have been tempted and have gotten bitten. This has firmed my resolve to never open an enclosure. Every time I do it, when the enclosure comes from someone who should know better (like an analyst at a major research firm) I have to wonder whether I should make an issue of it.<p>

I think a very strong statement like that needs to be out there.<p>

I also think it would be nice for Microsoft to have an easy to find control panel that makes it impossible for someone to send a virus through email enclosures. I have no idea if it's possible or not, I'd be happy to learn the issues, but it's a big problem.
