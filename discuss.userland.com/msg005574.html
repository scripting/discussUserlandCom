Makes sense?</i><p>

It's starting to. I think I'm full circle back to my (original) perceived problem. The calendar links now point to:
<ul><a href="http://myserver.com/1999/04/30">http://myserver.com/1999/04/30</a></ul><p>

Generating an error:<p>

Sorry! There was an error: Can't process the request because there is no object named "04".<p>

(I manually created 1999.root in my www directory)<p>

So it seems the problem is that 1999.root should be populated by daily news submissions. Correct assuption, or way off track? (the reason you get only one message a day on this thread is that I try a fix, then have to wait till the next day to see if my news gets archived)<p>

Till tomarrow....
