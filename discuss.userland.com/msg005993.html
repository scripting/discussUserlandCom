The net-net on this appears that the XML people haven't really accounted for this. They say that it should be done with HTTP redirects, but that's not a very good answer! How could we write a HOWTO for that?<p>

When I get a chance I'll add support for <redirect> to the server and write up a HOWTO on that. It seems to solve the problem neatly.
