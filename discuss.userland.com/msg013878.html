The idea of dialing into different ISPs is not like the web, it is like the old days of BBS systems and teletypes. Sure, there was a lot of value and excitement about time sharing and BBS systems but relative to the web, they were minor. WAP will be cute but if it doesn't become a minor blip shortly, then we'll still be locked into a regulated world defined by THEM!
