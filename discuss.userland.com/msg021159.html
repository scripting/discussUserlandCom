Any no-warrantee clause is rejected as invalid.</i><p>

It's not that much of a problem in the absence of a contract anyway.  Then it's just belt and suspenders style redundancy.  You found some of my code sitting in the street, and it says it has no warranty, but then after you shoot yourself in the foot with it, you want me to make you feel better.  Not bloody likely.<p>

I assume the invalidity of disclaimers is only in the context of some contractual relationship.<p>

If I sell somebody my code, then there is some other presumption that I'll take care of customers above and beyond what the code says.
