I've spent lots of time talking with people who believe there's value in the patent system. I don't believe there is any value in it. We can talk forever and never get anywhere. I prefer to spend my time inventing new stuff, this is a very productive period for me, I haven't shown my latest stuff yet, but when you see it, you'll see (hopefully) that we've broken down some barriers, and there will be no patents on any of it.<p>

BTW, the reason I asked you to read my stuff is that if you had, you would know my objection is having to deal with lawyers and courts for the right to practice my art. Yet you suggest that I try to negotiate with Amazon, or take them to court. You may have read my stuff, but you clearly weren't taking it into account.
