I think EPOC's the major OS for most of them now. Ericsson apparently did some kind of an exclusive deal with Microsoft about CE but then I heard another MS rep immediately say they're negotiating with other companies such as Nokia as well.<p>

>average lenght of an sms message is 160 characters<p>

160 is the max length. You can't go above it. The average lenght is probably less than a 100 due to all the short "ok" messages.<p>

Very true. I just checked - apparently new bank clients can't even get a check account here anymore. And related to the discussion, you can now pay your bills over WAP in most banks. :)<p>
