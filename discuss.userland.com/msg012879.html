Luke and I were emailing about the Qube, he asked me a question I didn't know the answer to, so I said "Let's start a Manila site!" There you go. We've got a few more in the pipe. I won't be satisfied until we're covering all the scripting and serving environments. I'm glad the Qube is the first such site, because I dig the Qube and everything it stands for. When the site gets going we're going to ask Cobalt for a pointer. <p>

NY Post: <a href="http://www.nypost.com/business/17831.htm">Gates waits for bailout from GOP</a>. "Texas Gov. George W.

Dale Dougherty: <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/oreilly/stories/storyReader$19">Will the new Red Hat Fit?</a> "Is this the future of software? To be acquired by either Microsoft, if you're successful, or AOL, if you're not."<p>

Red Hat's <a href="http://wideopen.com/story/5.html">Russ Mitchell</a>. "How will the old-guard, with so much to lose, fight back?" <i>This reminds me of an old <a href="http://www.musica.org/letras/ing2/1613.htm">song</a>.</i><p>

The Apache XML Project includes something called <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/index.html">Cocoon 2.0</a>, which is an XML-based CMS. I wonder why they didn't go with Zope, which is gaining a lot of momentum and would get them XML-RPC compatibility along with Python?<p>

Ted Nelson: <a href="http://www.xml.com/xml/pub/w3j/s3.nelson.html">Embedded Markup Considered Harmful</a>. Interesting essay. We could probably implement transclusion. I wonder if Nelson has a spec for how that would work at an authoring level.<p>

Microsoft's <a href="http://www.beta.msn.com/">beta version</a> of MSN. See if you can figure out what's new. Cluttered and ugly and filled with hard-sell. Better better better. If they're so much better why do they have to say it so often? These are really poorly designed sites! There's no focus, no place for my eye to land. Just a maze of shouted messages. <p>

<a href="http://www.privacyplace.com/">Privacy Place</a> is not a Manila site. It's run by a longtime friend, Fred Davis. We talked with them, but they decided to cook their own CMS. <p>

Red Herring: <a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/1999/1109/vc-vcmsft.html?id=userland">VCs Yawn at Microsoft Ruling</a>. "It's ironic this decision came down at a time when the Wintel alliance is at its weakest point in a decade, alternative operating systems are emerging for new digital devices, and Microsoft has failed to dominate in the area of content or the dot-com retail space," says Bay Partners VC Jim Wickett.
