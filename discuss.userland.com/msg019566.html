Imagine the value add of having comments like the ones you make linked into a whole fabric by an application that makes them available for anyone to read, if they're also running that application, simply by searching for Sting music. Your comments could have links to Sting's videos on the web, links to web sites you personally find interesting and relevant to Sting, links to your collection of MP3s that are either by Sting or by musicians he performed with at one time or another, etc etc. The possibilities are truly limitless. Just by starting from one topic -- Sting's music -- you can get a whole world of personalized information.<p>

Now imagine you're running this publishing application that lets you annotate and do all this, and its automatically published for web browsers. So the client doesn't have to be running the publishing application, instead, they connect through a familiar interface that they already have and use daily.<p>

That's the power of RU and more applications to come.
