It looks like we'll be able to do a full recovery. However it's going to take a few more hours. We've had this problem before, once, when we were first starting EditThisPage.Com, but we have a lot more sites now, so it takes longer to recover. Sorry for the outage, but.. what can you say -- it happens.<br><br>Oy Microsoft is <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/521625.asp?0na=22045P2B">still fighting</a> with Sun over Java. Prediction: Java developers won't switch to Microsoft. They want Write Once Run Anywhere. It's such a boring argument. It's why things stay small. Better bet -- build stuff that embraces Java, not routes around it. It won't work.

I'm listening right now. It's one of my favorites. "Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart." Too bright. I like the jazziness of Weather Report Suite. Dreamy and soft. How about The Other One? "Spanish lady come to me.." Michael Fuller suggests the entire Blues for Allah album. I'm listening to Blues for Allah right now. It's beautiful. Bluesy not jazzy. Quite dreamy and soft.

It must have happened as I was posting an email saying "Our servers don't crash anymore." <br><br>	Anyway, one of our machines is offline, the one hosting EditThisPage.Com, and a bunch of user sites. We will probably have to restore from a backup, but we're not totally sure at this time. We're going to find out how good our backup system is. And we're going to find out how fault-tolerant (some of) our users are. <br><br>	"curly"<br><br><b>Crediting sources<a name="creditingSources">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/25#creditingSources" title="Permanent link to 'Crediting sources' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Crediting sources' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	As the Desktop Website part of Radio gets close to completion, more people are using it (cool) and doing blogs with it. One of the nicest features is its "content router." Let's say I see a story in <a href="http://www.tomalak.org/">Tomalak</a> or <a href="http://www.myapplemenu.com/applesurf/">AppleSurf</a> and decide to route it to my Dot-Com channel or my Macintosh channel (just examples). To do that, I click on the Edit <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/myBlogScreen1.gif">button</a> next to the item, it flips to the My Blog page, where I can add comments, and <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/myBlogScreen2.gif">choose</a> categories. Then I click on Post or Post and Publish. Off it goes to my <a href="http://www.scripting.com/blog/">blog</a> and to the RSS channels for <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/rss/music.xml">Music</a> and <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/rss/macintosh.xml">Mac</a>. But wait a minute, I just took something from Tomalak and AppleSurf without giving credit. (Some of our bloggers have been manually inserting the credit, they're good people, of course.)<br><br>	<a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/radio-userland/6748">Last night before</a> going to dinner I added a feature that made credit-giving and flow-sharing automatic. Now when you blog something, the source information goes along with the link and is included in the RSS output. (This is why I added the <source> element a few weeks back, anticipating this.) Now, I got an email from Heng-Cheong Leong, the editor of AppleSurf, asking about this, this morning, and I was glad to have last night's post ready to show him. Yes, as the author of an oft-quoted weblog, I share his concern. I want my name and a pointer to my site to go along with the routings.<br><br>	Of course some idiot is going to patent this three years from now and sue me. "It's even worse.. etc."<br><br>	Meanwhile Karl Lewin is working on a Radio-like <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/zopeMakeRadioCool.gif">website</a> in Zope. And this is cool. Spread the load. Let's get a new content-routing network going. The more the merrier.<br><br>
