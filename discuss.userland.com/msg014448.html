You guys do great software and you have personally tried to maintain a dialogue with your users.<p>

I see a great opportunity for Frontier on Linux (I like the idea of my Mac playing nice w/ Windows and Linux!)...I'm only just becoming more and more of a sysadmin, so questions of WHAT these tools run on is becoming increasingly important. And at work, we are running Linux. Red Hat. Soooo...a Linux-based version of Frontier/Manila is exactly what we need for developing our intranet.<p>

Because of some of the arcana with which we deal (visit acronymania.editthispage.com and you'll start to understand...), easy-to-use tools that are not hideously expensive to buy and upgrade and that run on some fairly unsophisticated equipment are always welcome.<p>
