Now that our web development team has grown beyond a few people, individuals are finding it hard to keep track of changes made to the server database by users on other machines. <p>

We keep all of our media in Frontier -- PDFs, QT Movies, Real Media, etc -- and the GDBs for most of our sites are quite large, as a result. Trying to check out an entire site from the server via WebEdit usually chokes everything up. When it does work, it takes a l o n g t i m e.<p>

I figured someone has imagined, if not implemented the Lotus Notes-like function of being able to update only the changed pieces of a database without having to check out the entire thing from the server.<p>

While I've got the mike... has anyone worked out a way for a client machine to see what has been checked out from the server? I am sure there is a quick way to check the log via XML-RPC. (This would be a quck patch for our versioning problem until we get the synchronize GDB thing working.)<p>

Cheers!
