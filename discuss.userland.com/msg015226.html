Maybe even just having a *frames mode* as an option would be cool. And I guess you'd have to have a "finished editing" button to close out the edit frame when you're done.<p>

All this stems from the fact that I just about always keep a second window open when editing just for that purpose -- esp. changing my site html or color prefs -- and, like you Dave [and most of us!] have enough windows open already most of the time!<p>
