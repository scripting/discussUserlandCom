Dan Bricklin: <a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/byol.htm">Build your own log</a>. Dan accepts my invitation to work together to create a new literary medium. That's powerful. I've known Dan for over 20 years. Brilliant developer, hard-working, even tireless, ever cheerful, been thru the ringer and came out smilin. I think we'll even compete, eventually, but it's a big space, and I'm sure we'll stay friends. <i>Go get em Dan!</i><p>

<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/dreamweaver/stories/storyReader$229">Why</a> Andrew Wooldridge likes Manila. "Another cool thing for me is the upcoming exposure of Manila's power via XML-RPC. I use Dreamweaver extensively for my web-editing. With DW3 you get the ability to talk directly to Manila through DW3. So you can build all your cool interaction in DW, then serve it via Manila - all because of standards."<p>

This morning I spoke with <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/speech_klein.htm">Joel Klein</a>, US Assistant Attorney General, about the Microsoft anti-trust case. He asked what they should do, and I said I don't know. There was more to the conversation, but that was the gist of it. <p>

<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/fod/stories/storyReader$11">A followup email</a> I sent to Klein.<p>

Meanwhile back at the ranch, all I want for Christmas is an XML-RPC interface for DNS. I want to be able to make a call to my domain name server to map curly.stooges.com to 206.204.24.2. Pretty simple. (Christmas came early this year. <a href="http://www.menandmice.com/products/quickdnspro/index.html">QuickDNS</a> is scriptable, we have it running on one of our servers, we're going to put an XML-RPC interface on it from Frontier. We're working on it right now.)<p>

Steve Ivy has been working with MacLaunch on updating their <a href="http://search.maclaunch.com/detail.lasso?-db=applelinks_links&-lay=all&-recid=38363&-search">listing</a> for Frontier, but they still miss the point. Frontier is a server. It's not really about XML and COM. It's about Edit this Page.<p>

Today's top <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/lander/">story</a>, the search for <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/lander/science.html">water</a> on Mars.<p>

<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-box-http-soap-01.txt">The SOAP 1.0 spec</a> is now on the IETF website.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13412">UserLand's Andre Radke posted</a> a list of changes between SOAP 0.9 and 1.0.<p>

<a href="http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=Coenz0bWbu0znmdKXqq&FQ=UserLand&Nav=na-search-&StoryTitle=UserLand">Microsoft's press release</a> for SOAP 1.0, it accidentally ran a few days early and we missed it.<p>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mind/0100/soap/soap.htm">Microsoft</a> reviews SOAP. Andre says: "Just FYI, the MS article seems to have been written for the previous version of the spec, so most of the examples are now out of date."<p>

More new stuff on the <a href="http://release1.userland.com/">Release 1.0</a> weblog.<p>

<a href="http://www.ddj.com/news/">Dr Dobbs</a> has a weblog. <i>Welcome!</i><p>

<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/qube/stories/storyReader$98">Luke Tymowski reviews</a> Manila. "I can't think of an easier way to publish a Web site. I can't think of an easier way to allow a group of people to work together on a Web site. The closest tool I can think of to Manila is Squishdot, a product which runs on Zope. But Manila is more mature and flexible. Out of the box, Manila is in a class of its own."<p>

<a href="http://www.sunworld.com/swol-12-1999/swol-12-regex.html">Regular Expressions reviews</a> Lingo in a Nutshell. "Director users are just like the rest of us who work on overdue and ill-defined projects, with one exception: they've never been paid for good programming. Instead, they must deliver creative content, with zero scheduled downtime, and learn a programming language at the same time. That even 10 percent of them have become competent Linguists, as Epstein believes, is a tribute to the comfort level that Lingo offers."<p>

Somehow I missed this <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/indepth/docs/apple120199.htm">story</a> (must have been shipping a product) about Apple's new policy about authorship and design credit. There's a simple solution. Start a website. Allow anonymous posts. When Apple ships a new product, create a new section. Wait five days to see if anyone's name appears. Publish the list. It would be interesting to see if any names appeared. ";->"<p>

I've been looking for an excuse to put Curly on the home page, then I realized I didn't need one.<p>
