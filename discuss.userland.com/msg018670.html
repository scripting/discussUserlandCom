typical of technical folks like engineers who are
trying not to express an opinion about what someone
else is saying.  There are at least two common reasons.
One is boredom in the course of a necessary but rather
uninteresting presentation.  The other is savvy
avoidance of expressing a reaction that the speaker
is a pompous idiot, at least on a given topic.
Heads down is good for suppressing telltale lip
twitching and eyeball rolling, and the like.
One possible uncommon reason is fear of upstaging
a vindictive control freak by catching the eye of the
audience while he is speaking, since he will probably
review his performance later.<p>

Ballmer is waiting, and seeing whether any reporter
has an interesting reaction to what is being said.
Ballmer doesn't need to listen to Gates because he
has heard similar stuff before, and doesn't expect to hear
anything new in the slightest degree.  Gates can be
depended on to never ad lib or have sudden insights
(at least ones he cares to share).<p>

Gates is on autopilot, delivering a spiel he has
virtually memorized in his mind's eye.  He probably
never practiced this in the mirror, because he already
knows what he looks like when doing his robotic delivery.
Gates does not want a rapport with his audience.  He
wants to be understood in unambiguous terms that brook
no opportunity for interesting tangents.  Gates wants to
convey his knowledge of facts, and assure his audience
that nothing is out of control.  Gates is saying that
the project to extend the Microsoft municipal railroad
will be on time and under budget, and the trains will
continue to run on time.<p>

Paluzzo on the right looking at Gates is showing proper
behavior for a respectful Microsoft employee in public
who wants demonstrate suitable attention and obeisance
to figurehead authority.  Paluzzo is demonstrating what
the audience should be doing, and he knows perfectly 
well he is setting the visual context on Gates' left,
as opposed to a more independent right hand man Ballmer.
Paluzzo imagines if he turns his head, an audible creak
in his neck will spoil Gates' presentation, like a
rusty hinge squealing on stage during a theater play.
Paluzzo doesn't need to hear what Gates is saying, and
is forgoing a more informative look at any audience
reaction in order to set the proper mood.
