<I>Are there any chat systems that have easy open APIs?</I><p>

I'm happy to report that WebCrossing 3.1's XML-RPC support has evolved quite nicely, and WebCrossing also supports chat. This is almost certainly an appropriate starting point, at least for a "proof of concept" if not a production system. One of the things that's cool about WebCrossing's approach is that they have a server-side JavaScript implementation that wraps their discussion/chat objects, and any JavaScript function can be XML-RPC enabled, so you can write arbitrarily rich wrappers around WebCrossing's APIs and expose them through XML-RPC!<p>
