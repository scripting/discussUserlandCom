To break it up over several lines I need to line break within the html commands. <p>

Well glossSub returns complete [a href="link"]text[/a] links, that is they are correctly started and terminated. So the only option was to build the whole html line, but I needed a glossary patched link to the proper pages to do so. Only when I perused the macro code for glossSub did I see I could leave out the 'text' parameter and get the html link only. (whew)<p>
