The W3C expects a large time commitment from working group members. I seem to remember the number 40%. If you are good, then 40% of your time is worth way more than $5,000, so what's a little more?<p>

OTOH, the W3C has invited experts. I think the idea is that if you are good enough and willing to make the time commitment, you can participate in the process.<p>

It may be reasonable to ask why there's no way to participate in a smaller capacity, but since I have little experience getting standards out the door I'm not going to suggest any answers.<p>

I'm not affiliated with W3C, so if I've misunderstood something I'm sure someone will correct me.
