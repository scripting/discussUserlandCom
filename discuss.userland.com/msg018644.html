"This only works for MP3 files and you must have WinAMP to begin with. All this does is put the MP3 file name in your WinAMP playlist so that you can list[en] to the song as it downloads."<p>

Lawrence: Can someone explain how Gnutella talks to Winamp if you stream a MP3?
<BR>
Yytrium: it launches it with the name as a parameter
<BR>
Yytrium: it doesn't do any talking
