I felt uneasy when I originally saw that bit of the manila.rpc spec.<p>

<i>The security issues are orthogonal to that.</i><p>

Glad to see that I came to the same conclusion.  Best to use something like SSL and secure the entire channel.  I think the next version of Python will include an SSL implementation, meaning that it should be simple to just drop it into the existing xml-rpc implementation.<p>

Is the security issue one that will be addressed at some point?<p>

We're undergoing a security audit at work, so these issues are on my mind right now.<p>
