What Amazon.com is claiming is that they can present the related links based on the frequency with which others have been searching for.<p>

I am not sure how  other search engines present related links (maybe they are hand picked by editors). But would it not be obvious to pick something that is a hot selling product (which implies good frequency) or a story which got good hits-  even though the editor may not have worked out the math accurately or put it in a table.<p>

Or think of a situation of an actual store:<p>

A person asks the storekeeper for a book on Greek Architecture... and the shopkeeper instead suggests a book on Greek History... which was very popular... <p>

Of course the shopkeeper may not have a look-up table, but I think it is fairly obvious and therefore not quite patentable<p>

Cheers,

sorry shopkeeper... you need permission from Amazon.com for suggesting a best seller...
