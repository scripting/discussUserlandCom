That was how Melissa operated.  The solution you posted above takes care of Melissa-type viruses.<p>

Not this however.   This script does not execute from your email.  So turning off active scripting will not solve the problem. It is an attachment.  This requires the user to actually execute the code by double clicking it (or making the mistake in Outlook to click your paperclip).<p>

The problem is not Outlook per se at all.  The virus could have been sent to your Netscape e-mail, you double click it, and it would still kill your jpegs and other files it overwrites.  It just couldn't propagate itself.<p>

The only way to defeat this kind of virus is really watch those file attachments...
