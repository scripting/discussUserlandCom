I got an email, I forget from who, in response to this posting, saying that HTML doesn't count because it is not a Turing Machine. Of course that's true, I'm not sure its Turingness matters, but then I had a thought this morning that the purpose of XML-RPC is to turn the Internet into a Turing machine. I liked that description because it is so concise, assuming you know what a Turing Machine is.<p>

What is a Turing Machine? Here's a <a href="http://obiwan.uvi.edu/computing/turing/ture.htm">really cool site</a>.
