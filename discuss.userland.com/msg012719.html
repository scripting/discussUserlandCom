That's pretty drastic!<p>

Last week I tried to access Pacbell's web page information on DSL here in San Marcos, CA. The actual webpage that would allow input from me to do the calculations to determine if I am eligible for DSL, is broken. I wrote the webmster about that condition, no reply.<p>

Yesterday, I wrote the sales people at PacBell about the matter. I have heard nothing back yet.<p>

Some companies just don't get it that they need to monitor their email and websites much better.
