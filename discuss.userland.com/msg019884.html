Bingo. Eric Raymond usually has an agenda. He may not tell you the whole story, or he may tell you several stories at once.<p>

Aside from this decidedly unpleasant habit, he can be a really great guy. He writes <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/software.html">good software</a>, and he tries to record lots of <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/">interesting history</a>.<p>

Here's what Eric Raymond says about his PR role: <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/take-my-job-please.html">Take My Job, Please</a> and <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/understand-my-job-please.html">Understand My Job, Please</a>. He's trying to promote certain beliefs, but I'm personally uncomfortable with some of his methods.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
