<a href="http://www.xml-rpc.com/discuss/msgReader$136">The next step for XML-RPC</a>. We're going to specify a set of calls for hooking a desktop text editor into UserLand-hosted discussion groups.

<a href="http://www.evolt.org/index.cfm?menu=13">Evolt.Org was created</a> when Wired claimed copyright ownership of the WebMonkey mail list. It's a fascinating site, and was the source for yesterday's ultimate antique browser listing.<p>

WebMonkey has a different point of view on Evolt.Org, and <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$9755">Taylor expresses</a> it here on Discuss.UserLand.Com.<p>

Wired: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/21355.html">Chris Nolan Speaks for Herself</a>. "This has been a particularly difficult month for me. In the course of my more than 15 years as a reporter, I have landed more than my share of punches. And I can take a few. But these last few blows feel like rabbit punches; the hits are from behind and below."<p>

Bring on the next clonemaker, <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$9720">Compaq</a>. They should pay me for helping them debug their customer service. <p>

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/07/31/thecompaqofisps">In 1996 I said</a> I wanted an ISP that was as reliable and service-oriented as Compaq was in the 1980s. "We standardized on Compaq. All new machines purchased by the company had to be Compaqs. When we made this choice, the service got even better."<p>
