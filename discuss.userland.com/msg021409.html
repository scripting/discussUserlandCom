Right now would <i>not</i> be a great time to give us specific feature requests for Manila, as I've indicated our focus is in Frontier and Radio UserLand, from a user interface pov. When we're back working in Manila itself you'll know if you watch Scripting News or Frontier News. Right now we're seriously seeking testing and input on Radio UserLand. That's why I posted the heads-up on Scripting News today.<p>

We have Frontier users, and they have been asking for improvements to the outliner for years. It's frustrating to me that more of them are not in the loop. They're going to complain later that they didn't know we were improving the outliner.
