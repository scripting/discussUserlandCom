It feels like I'm older than my father. Had lunch with Sands today. It's funny how the voice doesn't change, but he's got bushy eyebrows now, just like me and <a href="http://www.rageboy.com/clocke1.gif">Chris Locke</a>. I wish we were still young.

This is the totally predictable ZDNet formula. A war theme. Pro-this, against-this. The real world is so much richer and more complex. I'm sure Stutz, who's a thoughtful and intelligent man, said other things about P2P and Dot-Net, but they quoted him as hurt and pissy. Rob Enderle, who I don't know, must have more intelligent things to say as well. Was InfraSearch really a hot startup? We never even saw their product. Edit out all the puffery and what is this article really saying? What's new here?<br><br>
