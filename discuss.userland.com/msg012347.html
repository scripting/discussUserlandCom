Do they? I think most 'bogs (Frontier-powered or not) look pretty similar. My Weblog wouldn't look much different if it was powered by Zope. Maybe this look works.<p>

<i>after all, why install frontier on a local machine if you are not going to customize it?</i><p>

Because I'm a techno-survivalist who doesn't like to rely on other people's servers. Also, Frontier has the outliner which I wouldn't want to live without.
