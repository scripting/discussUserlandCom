The way I look at it is that the files replace the database tier.  The end user and probably the developer would never really *see* them since they will be updated in the background.  This might work for someone utilizing something like <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/xml.apache.org/cocoon">Cocoon</a> where a physical XML file fits better into the framework than dynamic data from a database.  This isn't the future for Cocoon but that's another story.<p>

The next step for JAffiliate will be a JDBC interface to a relational database.  This will make storage and integration much better and more powerful.<p>

Thanks for all of your comments!  I look forward to more of them.
