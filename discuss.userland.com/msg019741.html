Just because your software is developed open source doesn't mean that it's free [of charge]. Consumers will continue to buy packaged software (or possibly a software subscription) whether the software's source code is freely available on the web or not. Millions of people buy boxed versions of numerous versions of Linux, simply so they don't have to wrestle with the large download and sometimes-painful installation process.<p>

There is also an emerging market in developing software using the open source software (OSS) development methodology, but in a closed (or gated) community of developers. Large companies like Sun, Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, etc. that develop large amounts of software can benefit from adopting the best practices of OSS development, but keep the source code closed. So, it pays off for developers to learn the OSS development methodology and then use those skills to work for the large software companies trying to get away from the horribly expensive closed-source software development model that is epitomized (and widely copied) by Microsoft.<p>

There are a number of companies today that are harnessing this energy and using it as a business model. Many people are aware of the free software project hosting that VA Linux uses with their SourceForge.net offering. Another company to watch is <A HREF="http://www.collab.net/">Collab.Net</A>, a company that has had considerable success in selling these kinds of project hosting/development services to the large software developers in numerous different markets.
