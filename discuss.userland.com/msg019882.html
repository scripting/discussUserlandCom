As I listened to you tell me why developers would adopt RDF I wondered if the DMOZ people knew you were doing what you're planning to do. I would never have made the connection if you hadn't. If there's no truth to it, why did you tell me the story?<p>

Perhaps you'd like to clear it up now? Is there a connection between your RDF work and DMOZ? How tight is the connection? What exactly is the connection?
