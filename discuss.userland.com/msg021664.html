Dave Winer: <i>
There's a philosophical face-off. People who view the
Internet as stages with audiences (the TV model) and people
who see it as something new that's not like TV. I'm in the
latter group. So far the money has been betting on the
former group. I'd like everyone who writes to have a website,
and to have tools for finding the stuff they want to connect with.</i><p>

I think there's an audience even under P2P rules, but the
audience is just ourselves and the folks sharing a space.
What's unusual and different from TV is that there's no
designated performer with privileged stage rights.  So P2P
has a more folk storytelling style to it, where the line
between performers and audiences is not at all a hard one.<p>

Yeah, we need more tools to support this style of human
interaction, with software that accelerates the mechanics
and handles the mundane details involved.  We need software
that blurs the boundaries between authoring tasks and
virtual presence tasks, so that authors can merge with
their audience (the rest of us and other authors) without
disrupting the creative experience.
