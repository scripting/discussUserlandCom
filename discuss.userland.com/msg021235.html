Yes yes yes!<p>

The only other people in my life that seem to understand this are my wife and an artist friend of hers.  They are both glass artists.<p>

The reason I know that software is an art is that no matter how much is written about methodology and planning and design, it still boils down to a creative spark.  It doesn't matter how hard I try to describe what I do to solve a problem, I keep using terms like "It felt right."<p>

And good software has an intense sort of beauty.  I just wish I could share it with more non-programmers.<p>
