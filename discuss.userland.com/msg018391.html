Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick<p>

In the deserts of Sudan<BR>
And the gardens of Japan <BR>
From Milan to Yacat&aacute;n <BR>
Every woman, every man<p>

Hit me with your rhythm stick <BR>
Hit me! Hit me!<BR>
Je t'adore, ich liebe dich <BR>
Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!<BR>
Hit me with your rhythm stick <BR>
Hit me slowly, hit me quick <BR>
Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!<p>

In the wilds of Borneo <BR>
And the vineyards of Bordeaux <BR>
Eskimo, Arapaho <BR>
Move their body to and fro<p>

Hit me with your rhythm stick <BR>
Hit me! Hit me!<BR>
Das ist gut, c'est fantastique <BR>
Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!<BR>
Hit me with your rhythm stick <BR>
It's nice to be a lunatic <BR>
Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!<BR>
Hit me! Hit me! Hit...<p>

In the dock of Tiger Bay <BR>
On the road to Mandalay <BR>
From Bombay to Santa F&eacute; <BR>
O'er the hills and far away<p>

Hit me with your rhythm stick <BR>
Hit me! Hit me!<BR>
C'est si bon, (indecipherable)
Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!<BR>
Hit me with your rhythm stick <BR>
Two fat persons, click, click, click <BR>
Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!<BR>
Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!<p>

Hit me!<BR>
Hit me!<BR>
Hit me!<BR>
Hit me!<BR>
Hit me!<BR>
Hit me! Hit me!<BR>
Hit me!<BR>
