We sell software. The old-fashioned way. To users.<p>

It's the only business model that works. It's interesting to watch the VCs try to parse this searching around for money and not finding any place to invest.<p>

Chuck D complained about the VCs too. He's got the business model that works for music. Create music and charge for it. Basic business 101. That the VCs wouldn't invest in a brilliant man like him is confirmation that I'm on the right track.<p>

We stop right exactly at the point where the music industry must pick up. You tell us how to get music onto a user's hard drive. We work with what's there. You tell us how to flow money from the user's bank account to yours.<p>

Like Napster, in a sane world, we charge for software and service. If someone else offers it for free, remember that you get what you pay for and there's no such thing as a free lunch. (Unless the world is in a delerious pyramid scheme mode.)
