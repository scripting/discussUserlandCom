I'm can't tell you why it changed, but you'll need to check you inittab file. This is where you can tell the system which runlevel to start at. <p>

Here's what to do (logged in as root):<p>

1. cd /etc
2 vi inittab<p>

The first un-commented line of that file should read something like<p>

id:5:initdefault:<p>

The number 5 in the above is the runlevel the system starts at. Runlevel 5 will start upon xdm, which gives you that X-Windows session login. The number should be changed to a 3.<p>

id:3:initdefault:<p>

I'm not sure if your familiar with using vi, so here's a real basic description of how to change and save the file. After you do step 2 above<p>

3. Arrow down to the line that reads id:5:initdefault: and then arrow over to the 5.
4. Hit the esc key to make sure your in command mode.
5. Type the letter x. This should delete the 5.
6. type the letter i. This will put you into edit mode.
7. Type a 3. The number should appear. The complete should read
id:3:initdefault:
8. Hit the esc key to put you back in command mode.
9. Type a : (That's a colon). The cursor should jump to the bottom of the screen and place a colon on the line.
10. Type in the letter w and hit return. You should see something saying it was saved.
11. repeat step 9
12 Type in the letter w and hit return.
13. reboot to see if it worked.<p>

Xeyes will start up with KDE because it saves your state each time you quit and restart it. From an xterm in KDE (logged on as root)<p>

1. type
ps aux | grep xeyes<p>

This will give a list of all running processes related to xeyes. Like this:
root 8998 0.0 1.6 3452 1S   18:38  0:00 xeyes<p>

2. the first line should end with xeyes. This is the one you want to stop.<p>

3. the numbers after the user name ( 8998 in the above example is the PID.<p>

4. type in 
kill and the PID number to stop it.<p>


Hope all this helps, and if you already knew the basics, I hope I did insult you.
