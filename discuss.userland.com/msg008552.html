Same for news.<p>

My problem is that now I'd like to have two discussion groups open to the public (no #members defined) but seperate memberships defined for [discussName].edit.* <p>

I log on to the second group, but the command bar is not getting the fact that I'm logged on. So I go digging, and find that "commonCommands" checks to see if pta^.adrMemberInfo is defined. It isn't. If I log into the default membership group, then it works. So how can I allow a discussion group to be open to the public, but let my code know that the user is actually logged in for the editing membership group for that DG?<p>
