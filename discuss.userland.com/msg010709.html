That would be me.<p>

Pardon me while I pick some holes in the solution you have. (You've covered the advantages pretty well)<p>

1) It's still in eudora, so the searching is still minimal. It works for text, but it's dog slow.<p>

2) Quick, list all the messages I've posted to the SM-community list.  It's a pain segmenting databases by month to work around some arbitrary limit.<p>

3) It still means that I ahve to think about it for 15 minutes a month. Given all the random crap in my life that only takes 15 minutes a month and hasn't been done for 6 months, that's a big drawback.<p>

4) Multiple machines.  My world is now networked, email archives should be on the net. The a reading/quick note client should be in my pocket. A longer writing station should be availiable at every computer. (this being 5+ machines at my house, 2 at work, and any internet cafe I may be recaffinating at.)<p>

When the ebay specialized browser hit, I thought that it could be pretty killer to make something similar for a mail client. Basically a web browser where you could control the menu commands that had a good text editing interface. There's not that many commands that are necessary for an xml-rpc interface to a mailserver. (maybe the suites.dg could be a good 90% solution.)  If you could configure with a url + username+ password, you would solve a hell of a lot of email configuration problems while not giving up the quality of interface that people have come to expect from a computer program with one specific purpose. <p>

BTW, I've been working on dumping mail messages into a discussion group to get the full text indexing and such happening easily. It would also allow DG posts to propagate to the SM list from previously subscribed users. Picture a hybrid mailing list/discussion group to see what I'm getting at.  I'm still not sure if I like the discussion group interface any better than the (relatively similar in concept) interface that I'm using for my web email pages, but there's a familiarity with the discussion group that others don't have with my design.   <p>
