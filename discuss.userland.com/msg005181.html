I understand that. I just wanted to point out that there's another approach to skinning this cat. I understand that many people write text in a word processor, and I do that myself for some things. But for text that I'm aiming at both web and dead trees, it gets written in Frontier and then exported to Word.<p>

After posting the earlier message, I also started pondering exporting Frontier source text to pdf (Acrobat) with formatting preferences that would be ignored by the HTML renderers. I think it's possible, and may have to do some experimentation in that direction, too.<p>
