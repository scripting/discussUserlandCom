That's a dangerous attitude. It reminds me of the statement "All swans are white", which was a mainstay of logic textbooks from classical times. After all, given the evidence around you, it seems as reasonable a statement as "the angles in a triangle, <b>by definition</b>, always add up to 180deg."<p>
