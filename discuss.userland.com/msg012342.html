This is silly, and the Times should be embarrassed to have printed it.<p>

Short of out-and-out kickbacks to the reviewers, if the reviewers genuinely have "no vested interest in the products," how can the information be anything <I>but</I> worthwhile? Epinions, in particular, is quite careful to compensate its reviewers regardless of whether the review is good or bad. Plus all members can review the reviewers. Unless you really have a strong philosophical bias against free market forces, it's hard to see anything wrong with this approach.<p>

Since the Times itself is, of course, an advertising-supported medium, I think we need to consider the strong possibility that it perceives systems such as Epinions a threat: a free opinion market won't be subject to "branding," spin, and the usual obfuscatory nonsense that only works thanks to "broadcast" (in a broad sense, including print) media.<p>

Couple this with the Staples spokeswoman, after Staples naively sent a five-digit $20 discount "coupon" to a list of wired customers and got ripped off blind when the number showed up on web sites, news groups, etc. (see <<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-852171.html?tag=st.cn.1002newsfd">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-852171.html?tag=st.cn.1002newsfd</a>.>) claiming "We're seeing the problems that come from moving brick-and-mortar companies to the Web," and you really have to wonder whether such organizations are <I>deliberately</I> attempting to mislead the reader or are merely <I>dangerously ignorant</I>.<p>

The only thing I can say for sure is that I'm getting tired of the twaddle.
