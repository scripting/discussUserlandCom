Although it's via email and not on a web page (yet!), I get Scripting News, Slashdot, Hack The Planet, Whump, and now Tomalak, Camworld, and Bump mailed to me every night by a small Java program that I wrote.<p>


IMHO, Whump has the best format for this, followed closely by the ScriptingNews bunch, with RSS a distant third -- and Slashdot is way behind.  By best, I mean a combination of being easy to parse and having enough context to get a meaningful message. <p>
