As noted in an earlier message (#3334) this is not a web page but an application.  IE5 gives us advanced control over caching, so that once our Javscript object classes and artwork have been loaded, there's no need to ever reload anything.  All communication with the server happens in real-time and individual 'elements' of the interface can be updated without anything being touched or refreshed.<p>

This is what the generic HTML version of MTTF's technical information looks like.<p>
