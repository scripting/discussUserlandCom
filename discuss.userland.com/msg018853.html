Why were there virtually no Microsoft representatives at the conference? I didn't see any at all.<p>

It's clear to me that Microsoft does not believe in the open source software concept, nor do very many OSS developers really want Microsoft to be in their camp. This does not mean that they couldn't co-exist, because they easilycould and to some extent already do. There are numerous OSS projects that are Windows-centric and target developers using the Windows platform for software development.<p>

The open source community <b>is</b> growing up. We're seeing signs of this by watching the number of companies who are moving into this arena. It's pretty silly not to look back at the early days of Microsoft, Apple and the rest of the computer industry and ignore the fact that they too had to mature into the companies and monopolies they are today.
