Try following <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$140">this procedure</a> for each of the root files you mention.  Substitute your file names where appropiate.  I'd hold onto the original files in a safe location for a short while until you are sure the new files work OK.<p>

On a few occasions I've had files that would open and close no problemo, but when working deep within the ODB or saving a copy of it, error messages would show up.<p>

Get back to us if you need more help.
