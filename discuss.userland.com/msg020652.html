I'd add politics to the mix when talking about the GPL. Although, thinking about it, the GPL actually forces you to build a wall to completely separate your contributions from those of others if you choose to develop both commercial as well as GPL'd software.<p>

As for PR, the ebb and flow of the media is build it up, then tear it down. Open source is being lauded right now, but something will happen to turn the media against it, be it too much good press or linux company failures.<p>
