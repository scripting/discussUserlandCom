It's only about us. It's not a matter of being against anyone.<p>

Eric Raymond coined the term "open source" to try to explain free software to clueless suits. It's just a marketing buzzword, and not an accurate label for a concept of freedom that cannot be fully explained in a catchy phrase (although "free as in speech, not as in beer" comes close).<p>
