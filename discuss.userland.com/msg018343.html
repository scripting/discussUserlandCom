The problem that most MP3 players have when compared to CD and MD personals is that unless you're extremely easily pleased, you need to manage your playlist on a daily basis or worse. The PJB-100 turns this problem on it's head - you don't need to think about your playlist at all. If you've got 1200 songs at hand, "shuffle" mode takes on a whole new dimension. This lack of effort means that I've started using the player on foot, something I'd long ago given up with old-school personal stereos.<p>

The downsides - 
Price: $750 is a lot of money for a portable.  
Size: way larger than any other MP3 player (but smaller than a CD personal. And like I said - the same size as a Mk.1 Sony Walkman, which has got to be significant.)
Software: No Windows 2000 driver yet - '98 only.<p>

But... it's in a class of it's own. I think it really is a milestone product. Their site is at <a href="http://www.pjbox.com">http://www.pjbox.com</a>, BTW.
