<a href="http://www.evenbetter.com/">http://www.evenbetter.com/</a> (formerly "dealpilot.com") is a price searching 'bot which lets you find the cheapest source for books, music or videos. You choose your item, tell it where you live and it goes out to all the major online retailers' web sites to find which companies can get the product to you cheapest, including shipping charges, returning a list of retailers sorted by price.  You can decide to take a chance on the cheapest (who may be someone you've never heard of), or just scan down the list until you find a brand you like.  Better still, it also allows you to create a local shopping cart of multiple items so that you can find the company who can fulfill your entire order for the least money.  It seems to work very well.<p>

They've also got a small (Windows) application which runs along side your browser and lets you surf around a retailer's site (like Amazon) and easily kick off a lowest-price search for any product you find there.  So I can not only take sales away from Amazon, I can waste their server's time first.  Sweet!<p>

Of course, retailers may choose to block Evenbetter.com's 'bot. In the case of Amazon, that would be fine with me, as they are one company I WON'T buy from if it ever happens to come up as cheapest.
