And I'm last-born.  You do remind me of my oldest brother, fwiw.
But nothing at all of my first-born spouse.<p>

The voices thing reminds me of an interesting read from long ago,
Julian Jaynes' "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of
the Bicameral Mind" (ISBN 0395563526 for the reissued edition?).
It might be half-baked, but I found it to be fascinating
speculation, and there's a good tie-in with music as well.<p>

As for mitigation, you don't have to be first-born to have a
too-short temper.  I found the
<a href="http://pobox.com/~tva/corplife.html">HeartMath</a>
concept to be extremely useful.  Deal with the physiology in
an effective manner, and there isn't much of a problem left.
