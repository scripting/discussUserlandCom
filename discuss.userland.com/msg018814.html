The agents will email/call/go to internet music stations and CD stores and promote the artist.  These agents will all come together in companies that represent thousands of artists, to take advantage of better economies of scale and to have more influence to get their artists a better deal. The company will be able to get their client's music out better than individual agents, so they will force out all the small agents.  The commisions for these agent services will increase, as artists increasingly need these agents to get big deals.  Eventually they will call themselves e-record companies.  <p>

I am very cynical about this whole Free-The-Music-From-The-Evil-Record-Companies movement.  It will simply change the form of the oppressor, not lessen the oppression.
