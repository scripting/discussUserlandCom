I agree with them about how the NITF and XMLNews formats are next to useless because they use the natural language of the actual story to codify (or not codify, if you will) the news item.<p>

Looks to me like they need something not-so-specific like a HumanInterest type. And in each of these types of news item, some single tag for "additional info" where actual reporter commentary would ride.<p>

I mailed my comments to <a href="mailto:erik@signiform.com">erik@signiform.com</a> along with the address of Matthew's original post in the dg. Maybe these xml news people will come over and talk with us all.
