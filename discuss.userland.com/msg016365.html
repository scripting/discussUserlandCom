I don't mind making an issue of this stuff, but I hope it does some good. <p>

Don't think so much about your freedom to join me in exposing a slovenly ISP, think about your freedom to talk about things *you* want to talk about. We need air cover for all the diversity of the Web, not just sites hosted here. As far as I can tell, the issue of integrity on the Web has never been covered. What are the unique requirements? How are the protections different? Why isn't lack of editorial interference marketed as a benefit of using one ISP over another? How can we create an environment that lasts for a hundred years, and is not subject to laws like the one in the UK? Could we create an Akamai-like company that added a new kind of reliability to the Web?<p>

Lance Knobel sent me another email suggesting that a US ISP advertise in the UK that it would host their sites without interference from the UK legal system. I say, before that can work, we need to get the ISPs here in line.<p>

Conxion continues to slime me with reporters, talking about a personal friendship between me and Conxion CEO Antonio Salerno (no way), and saying they offered concessions that they have not offered. Wired and Salon have both investigated. As far as I know, no other publication has looked into this.<p>

Bottom-line, we need an editorial integrity statement that's two-way. We need the ISPs to agree to it. I have a feeling that you, Jeremy, will play a role in drafting this statement.
