Here's a new interesting site which allows you to gather pieces from other web sites and combine them on to one page. <p>

Example: I can take the lead story from four different sources and make one page out of it. The stories are updated when each site is updated, since they are grabbed directly from the sites.<p>

A very cool new approach to the "portal" or personal homepage. You don't have to use only what the portal offers as information sources, the whole web is yours to choose from.<p>

(the site is still in beta mode, but it is functional)
