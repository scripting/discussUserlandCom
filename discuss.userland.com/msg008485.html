Most of the new weblog channels aren't being maintained, so I'm definitely not going to link to them from SN. <p>

BTW, I don't take suggestions about what goes on the Scripting News home page. If I want to link to your channel I will, but if you ask me to do it, esp in public, I won't. I don't want to be bombarded with mail from people claiming some kind of right to placement on my home page.<p>

The key point, the My.UserLand.Com home page is high flow. Your articles appear on that page. So you're being heard. I think you must not know this. If it's not clear what I'm saying, ask some more questions.
