mechanism that allows a server to say "this resource has
moved".  all clients already support this (if they don't,
they're seriously broken).  smart clients even update their
caches and other configuration tables if they get a permanent
redirect.<p>

duplicating this in the <i>document</i> seems like a very
strange thing to do...<p>

<i>How could we write a HOWTO for that?</i><p>

Here's one for Apache:<p>

if you move a file, add a line like this to the
<i>.htaccess</i> file in the original directory (create
one if necessary).<p>

RedirectPermanent /old.xml <a href="http://my.server.com/new.xml">http://my.server.com/new.xml</a><p>

make sure you've written it all on one line, and that
the second URL is a full URL (including the host part).<p>

if this doesn't work, ask your local server administrator
for help, and/or check the apache FAQ at <a href="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</a>.
