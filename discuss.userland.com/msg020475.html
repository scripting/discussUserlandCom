With TrulyFree source, you can not only peruse the code for ideas, but you can incorporate that code into your work and not feel the need to make your own source open.  With GPL'd source, you can still peruse the code for ideas (just like a book), you just don't have the right to incorporate the code into your own work, unless you do make your source open as well.<p><p>
