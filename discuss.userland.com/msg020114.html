Certain licenses are considered to be "compatible" with the GPL. If you use one of those licenses, you can co-operate with people who use the GPL <i>without using it yourself.</i><p>

The definition of "compatible" involves some legal technicalities, so I'll just list some examples:<p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>new</i> BSD license (without the advertising clause).</li>
<li>The X license.</li>
<li>The LGPL license ("Lesser GPL").</li>
<li>"The logical disjunction of the Artistic License and the GPL." (If you really want to know what this means, ask Larry Wall to explain.)</li>
</ul><p>

Each of these licenses allows co-operation between proprietary developers and developers who use the GPL.<p>

I routinely donate code to the GNU project under the X license, for example. This doesn't create any outages for me, and it doesn't create any outages for the GNU developers.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
