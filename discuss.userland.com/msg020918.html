Thanks Amazon. </i><p>

Demand based pricing is a fact of life. Ever fly?  I'd bet that no 2 people on the plane paid the same price (unless they are on the same ticket), even though they nominally are getting the same service. <p>

Would you take different prices for 'members' than for non-members?  Safeway does that. Savings in exchange for your personal data.<p>

What about different delivery schedules for 'out of stock' items depending on how good the customer is?  PITA, it's never in stock. Good customer, 1 week. Potentially $$$ customer, it's in stock.<p>

What about encouraging the matre d' for a reservation. <p>

And for Very special friends of Rick, we have a very special price.<p>

It happens, it's a known thing. Amazon got caught in a particularly arbitrary scheme. <p>
