I guess in my mind the "Process" is that process by which decisions are made within an organization. In <a href="http://www.gdss.com/COM.htm">Capturing Organizational Memory</a>, and on their website, GDSS is promoting a system of capturing the entire thought process behind the decisions that are made during a meeting. I see <a href="http://www.gdss.com/Questmap/aboutQM.htm">QuestMap</a>, GDSS's software, as a sort of graphical "minutes" of a meeting.<p>

I think technography facilitates the making of decisions, while something like QuestMap records the event.<p>

To wrap up, I agree with you, Bernie. Technography doesn't <i>capture process</i>, it <i>facilitates</i> it- something infinitely more useful, in my mind. Yes, it's nice to have a record of the process by which a decision is made, <i>if</i> the decision <i>is made</i>. Technography, I think, helps that decision to be made faster and with a greater consensus.<p>
