(It's got the functionality of a Cube server + Oracle in half the size.)<p>

It would be cool to do something like that for Frontier.  Actually, I believe the idea has been kicked around before.<p>

<shameless plug>
BTW, if anyone experienced with marketing a bundled hardware/sofware solution is around, please send me a message and we should talk.  My friends have built the prototype and are hoping to sell this worldwide, not just in Japan.  I can at least show some pretty cool jpegs of the product.</shameless plug>
