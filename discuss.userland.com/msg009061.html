An example. We wanted scriptable email. So I said to Apple, let me have the source for AppleLink. Surprisingly, they did! I hired a consultant. He added the Apple Event support. We asked for permission to distribute the result. They said no. <p>

Another one. I wanted to be able to script PhotoShop. Adobe kept saying they would do it, but they never did. It would have made a huge difference to be able to automate PS.<p>

On the other hand, I have respect for intellectual property. I understand that my life would be better if I had their property. But they don't want me to have it. That's life in the fast lane.
