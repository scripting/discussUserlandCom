I have worked for a number of high-tech companies over the last 25 years. Each of the large ones, without fail, had a written policy that prohibited engineers from searching for patents. The reasons for the policy were generally unstated, but I learned in various conversations that:
<ul>
<li>The adverse consequences of patent infringement are much less severe if the infringement is unknowning.
<li>Most engineers would search a patent database badly, missing patents on which they might infringe. The consequences of infringement in this case are as bad as if you knew about the patent. ("Should have known" == "knew" in some legal sense.)
</ul><p>

Yet more evidence that the patent disclosure isn't really advancing the state of the art (at least in software), and perhaps shouldn't be rewarded as if it were.
