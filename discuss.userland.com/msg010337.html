When I said "This is great!" I was rushing out the door to get to the O'Reilly Convention. I had not had time to really see what it was.<p>

Second, I have not specifically asked MoreOver.Com to do this, I think he's referring to my general evangelizing of RSS, which I certainly *am* doing. I am uncertain as to the legality or appropriateness of this form of syndication. I'm not saying it's wrong, but I'm not saying it's right either.<p>

My acid test for this is "How would I feel if he scraped my site?" My answer is "I wouldn't like it." Would I object? I'm not sure. I certainly would object if he hadn't asked permission.<p>

This came up once before with the Internet Alchemy "synthetic" channels. I wrote a script to batch load them, but then the same day I unloaded them. I didn't want the legal exposure, nor did I want to swamp our aggregator with stories from sites that weren't supporting RSS. I decided that my stake is with RSS, for now at least. I want to watch this stuff, and hear what other people think. So in that way, I welcome the MoreOver.Com move to support RSS. It will be a learning experience for all of us.
