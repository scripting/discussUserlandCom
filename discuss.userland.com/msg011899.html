Are you asking for a way to issue a xml-rpc request on UserLand's server to create customized html (from xml repositories) that is returned to you complete based upon certain parameters?<p>

Are you also asking for data to be returned using a similar fashion that is ready to load into your database? That data would not necessarily be in xml format? Maybe the data delimited in some other way?
