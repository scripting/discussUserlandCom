better and sell it prevents the sort of mediocrity you mention 
from happening. The various BSD UNIX implementations are
licensed in this way. Alas, Linux is licensed under the GPL,
which attempts to force developers to give their creative work
based on the original code away for free. This is a strong
disincentive to progress and encourages mediocrity and/or
reinventing the wheel needlessly.<p>
