(And Dave can go somewhere else....) I know of several commercial printers, yea I live in the bible belt, who have refused printing jobs due to nudity, partial nudity, or other adlut related content. (FYI - not stuff that I've asked them to print...)<p>

How Conxion's decision relates to the "contract of service" which Dave should have is a matter for the legal begals to decide.
