"Bill Gates' Microsoft weighs in with sales of $19 million and a product line, Windows, that runs 100 million computers, 90 percent of the market."<p>

So lets say that 100 million is spread out over 10 years worth of buying.  That means each copy of Windows must have averaged out to cost about $2. ";->" That has to be the best software deal ever.  Too bad Microsoft couldn't get numbers like that admitted as evidence in their trial; they'd be in a lot less hot water.<p>

Disclaimer: This is in no way a rip on the CNN site.  It's one of my most frequently used resources on the web.  Plus, hey it's early (or late depending on how you look at it).<p>

PS Dave, don't you ever sleep?  My goodness, I click over to Scripting News to go through yesterdays links and there's already stuff for Thursday at 4:00AM PST.  That's what I call a passion for what you are doing.
