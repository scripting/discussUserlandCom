Because his lawyers told him to?  ("after all, now
that we have this strict definition in place, you
can actually say 'no' without that being perjury,
and it isn't really related to this case anyway,
and the constitution says you cannot be expected
to witness against yourself..." -- isn't jurisprudence
pretty much the art of making people behave as
computers...)<p>

...<p>

Or more likely, because it's the standard behaviour
for politicians in situations like this?  We've had
a series of minor scandals here in Sweden involving
local politicians, alcohol, sex clubs, and elaborate
schemes to put large or small amounts of tax money in
their own pockets.<p>

Virtually everyone lied about it when they got caught,
and blamed the media for everything.<p>

Guess it's the same thing all over the world...<p>

Cheers /F
