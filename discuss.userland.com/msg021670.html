1. Wait until a few other developers get through the installation. There's clearly some kind of configuration error on your system. All the code is there. If you're not the kind of person who likes looking through code, wait a bit longer, and hopefully a project will develop around aggregator.root.<p>

2. Post your requests for help on aggregator.weblogs.com, not here. Posts on that DG are forwarded to members of the mail list, people who have proactively said they're interested in aggregator.root. You're more likely to get help there than here.
