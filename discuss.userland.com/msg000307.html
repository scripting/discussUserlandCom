Seagate just announced a 50Gb drive!  It won't be available until 3/99 but you can get a 36Gb drive from them now - if you're willing to spend $1800 and put a SCSI controller in your PC.  (Only 5 years ago I bought a 1Gb SCSI drive for $1200, ah, for the good old days.  HA!)<p>

Actually, any of these drives is pretty good, you could store some serious video on any one.<p>
