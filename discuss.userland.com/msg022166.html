Take a programmer to lunch. Take <i>two</i> programmers for twice the fun. Act now, you never know, you might <a href="http://world.std.com/~jlr/doom/doom_eng.htm">not</a> get another chance.<br><br><b>Apple on board<a name="appleOnBoard">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/04/30#appleOnBoard" title="Permanent link to 'Apple on board' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Apple on board' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	I note, with pleasure, that SOAP and XML-RPC are on the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc2001/descriptions.html#607">agenda</a> at Apple's WWDC starting May 21 in San Jose. <br><br>	I hope the Mac developer community embraces these protocols, they're very good for the Mac, imho, because they allow lots of choice, no one knows what OS is at the other end of the pipe. <br><br>	This is how the Windows monopoly can ease, by making it safe and easy to <i>not</i> use Windows.<br><br><b>Can't touch that<a name="cantTouchThat">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/04/30#cantTouchThat" title="Permanent link to 'Can't touch that' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Can't touch that' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	Some people still think deployed formats and protocols can change. This is a major disconnect. People on mail lists think that "everyone" is here, and that they all can change their implementations just because some people think they know how to do it better. <br><br>	However, in the real world, once code is deployed to customers, if you change the formats, you break the users. So there comes a point beyond which you cannot change the format, if you care about the users. If you're in business, you have to care about the users. Almost every mistake we make is when we decide our point of view is more important. <br><br>	This happened last summer when some <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">RDF</a> people tried to take over "RSS". I was left saying but but what about the users? Well the revolution didn't happen, predictably, and imho the revolutionaries did more to break RSS than Netscape did when they turned off their servers last week. We're still picking up the pieces from both breakage events.<br><br>	<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss">9/2/00</a>: "In the overworked world of Web development, there's no time to study, there's only time to do."<br><br><b>SOAP 1.1 deployment<a name="soap11Deployment">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/04/30#soap11Deployment" title="Permanent link to 'SOAP 1.1 deployment' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'SOAP 1.1 deployment' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	A breakage-related discussion is going on on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders">soapbuilders</a> list. Some people think we should change the way we use the SOAPAction header. (Or do they? The messages are confusing.) Others think we should change schemas. Oy the breakage that would fall out from that. No way.<br><br>	Meanwhile, as the arguments develop, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/microsoftDeployingSoap.gif">Microsoft is deploying</a>, which means very soon we must lock down our SOAP stack and say "This Is It," this is what we will support for perpetuity, so UserLand customers, please start deploying, and of course that will be good, even when new people come along and say we're doing it wrong, which according to Murphy's Law, which applies to protocol specs, they surely will. In my humble opinion, the time for that is passing <i>quickly.</i> We published a <a href="http://www.soapware.org/bdg">spec</a> to explain our practice, and we think it's a solid basis for our software interoperating with others. <br><br>	BTW, we're trying to avoid the situation where SOAP interop means "Works With Microsoft," which as I've said <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/03/29/unstallingSoap#myChoice">before</a> would be a failure for SOAP.<br><br><b>RDF query<a name="rdfQuery">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/04/30#rdfQuery" title="Permanent link to 'RDF query' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'RDF query' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	What is it about the culture of RDF that says "All your spec belong to us." I saw a presentation at the W3C Web Services Workshop where a nice man from Colorado explained how SOAP could be RDF-ized. While he was speaking I was wondering why they don't create their own revolution, then we can support them. Instead they try to impose their point of view on us, they must wonder why everyone runs away when they show up.<br><br><b>Dinner with Docs<a name="dinnerWithDocs">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/04/30#dinnerWithDocs" title="Permanent link to 'Dinner with Docs' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Dinner with Docs' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	I had a lovely dinner last night with <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com">Doc Searls</a> at Siam Garden in Menlo Park. I've been going there for ages, and Lee, the host, always greets me as "Doctor Winer" and I call her "Doctor Lee." (BTW, they have the best Thai food on the peninsula.)<br><br>	I always introduce my guest to Lee, she has a fantastic memory, so I said, and this is my friend.. (Gulp. His name <i>is</i> Doc!) ..Doctor Searls. I had to explain that he's not <i>really</i> a doctor, and then Lee said she isn't either, and I admitted the same was true for me. We all had a good laugh and went on with our dinner.<br><br><b>Dotcom lunacy?<a name="dotcomLunacy">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/04/30#dotcomLunacy" title="Permanent link to 'Dotcom lunacy?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Dotcom lunacy?' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	This morning I got a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/iAmOneOfThePeople.gif">reminder</a> to vote in the Webby Awards, not like any sites I care about ever get nominated. I'm tempted to say that this is a remnant of the dotcom lunacy. OK this one time I'm going to succumb to temptation.<br><br>
