Some questions about the my.userland.com page:<p>

Do you archive the pages from previous days, and are they accessible? I couldn't find how to get at the content from a previous day.<p>

Do you archive the items or just point to them as they appear in hosted weblogs? If the latter, it may be impossible to retrieve items from older incarnations of hosted weblogs. In my weblog for example I was planning to start from an empty list of items each day, because I only get this small text area window in which to edit.<p>

Do we get to use a glossary or some other way to link into the general content flow on the site? Sometimes I want to react to an item e.g. in the Ecletic weblog, and I have no easy way to refer to it.<p>

For the umpteenth time: thanks for the weblog service. These are not ransom demands, just things that would be nice to have :)
