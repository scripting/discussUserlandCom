There is absolutely no reason why Gecko/Mozilla browser couldn't do what you want and more - without having to go through intermediaries like you might have to do at Microsoft.<p>

I would challenge anyone reading this who wants xml-rpc for mozilla to find some coders and get them on the CVS tree for gecko!<p>

I'm not saying it's an easy or trivial task, but it _is_ just a matter of finding someone who would take the time to do it - not a matter of trying to get some third party out of your control to do it.<p>

---Also - on another note - you will be able to create HTML-enabled pages from within a page - meaning you will have an HTML-savvy form field in Gecko that let's you create and view in the field HTML as it would look like were it read on it's own in the browser...<p>
