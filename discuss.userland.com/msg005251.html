Here's a different approach, one that I am actually exploring right now in a side project:<p>

Move the consoleData table into the consoleSite table and rename it to #consoleData. Move the contents of the consoleSuite table into consoleSite.#tools.<p>

Now you will have to fix a lot of addresses. Wherever you have been refering to consoleData, refer to pta^.consoleData^. Wherever you have been refering to consoleSuite, refer to pta^.tools^. You can leave off the "pta^." and "pta^.tools^." part from inside a macro since the page table and the #tools table are already in scope in that case.<p>

You should end up with a self-contained website table that will then be easy to duplicate. (I think -- as I said, I am still exploring this approach myself...)
