Here's the problem:<p>

The DLL calls an external function to get the HTTP response. This response includes the HTTP header followed by HTML text (or an error message, or image data, or whatever).<p>

The header may indicate 200 OK, 404 NOT FOUND, whatever. It may specify any MIME type.<p>

I want to return the entire response -- as-is -- to the client. But -- IIS insists on adding its own 200 OK header to either the beginning or end.<p>

If I use the << operator, then IIS adds its 200 OK header before my header.<p>

If I use WriteClient, then IIS adds its header after my return string.<p>

I've tried calling ServerSupportFunction (HSE_REQ_DONE_WITH_SESSION...) but that doesn't help.<p>

I want to just return a string containing the response header and content body -- and have IIS keep its hands off it.<p>

I don't want to parse and strip the header I'm getting from my return string, then re-build it using ServerSupportFunction.<p>

How can I stop IIS from adding its own header? Is there a method besides WriteClient or the << operator I should use? Or: where is the header being added, and how can I over-ride that?
