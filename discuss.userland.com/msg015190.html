Honestly, as much in the past as I have enjoyed IRC, ICQ, and many stupid and obscure homepages scattered all about in different so-called web-communities [i.e. Geocities], <b>ETP</b> is like nothing else!  Hands down I'm a Manila addict... doing far less *surfing*, etc. than before, and creating and simply *being* a part of a <i>real</i> web-based community - way more than I ever thought I'd find the time to do.  I love it... I love ManilaLand!<p>
