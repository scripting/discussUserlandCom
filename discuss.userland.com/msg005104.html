Try this: go to discuss.userland.com, and logoff. This ensures you don't have any cookies.<p>

Go back to discuss, and reload. Now we're going to pretend we're back. So login. After you successfully login, you're presented with a list of sites to go see, at this point, you can jump back to the discussion group.<p>

Now, suppose I know people loging in are using the discussion group. It's a hassle for that intermediate page to be there. I want them to login, and discuss. That's that. However, the way mainResponder currently works, it makes it impossible to do this. When we click the login button to submit our mailaddress/password combo, mainResponder checks to see if they match.
If they match, it serves up the apropriate page. However, when serving this
page, mainResponder doesn't have two critical values defined: adrMemberInfo
and memberGroupName. Eventhough we know who it is, the cookie hasn't been
sent to the client and come back to us. Those two values are defined only
when the cookie recieved. So, that intermediate page gets served up and
mainResponder doesn't really know who it's serving it to, but it sets the
apropriate cookie.<p>

When you click the subsiquent link to the discussion group, the cookie
get's sent in, and mainResponder knows who you are. Everything works
according to plan.<p>

The change involves seting those two values in pta after we decide the
mailaddress/password combo check out and we send the cookie back.<p>

Why is this helpfull? Well, it lets you create your own forms that jump to
anypage you desire. Yet, you still get the full benefits of mainResponder
membership and authentication.<p>

I hope that clears things up. When the fix gets put back in, download the
demo roots linked by the discussion group message. I think it's a good
example of setting up your own login pages.
