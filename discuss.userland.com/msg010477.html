None. Lawrence Lee posted a <a href="http://www.callaw.com/stories/edt0604.html">pointer</a> to a Cal Law article about database copyright protection. In the US, no such protection exists. In Europe, there is a law, but it only extends to countries that have equivalent laws. In other words, it's a mess. That's why NSI's <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$networksolutionssucks.com">legend</a> is so ridiculous. There's no legal ground to it. (And they keep changing it! Today it isn't even good English!) We could crawl their database and parse it, and mirror it, and there's nothing they could do about it. (Well, of course they could sue, but it would be a frivolous lawsuit.)
