Maybe Dan can cull out a few ideas for a column.<p>

  People who use firewalls do not understand the issues. The vbs viruses are a social issue for which there should have been a technological fix by now (a software sandbox). A user can socially engineer a user to run trojan code in the OS.<p>

The problem with the security model was pointed out back in 1995/1996. After several revisions, of the OS, the same problems still exist today. Well, maybe the people were looking at the wrong issue back then. They were worried that signed code could do anything, and not that unsigned code could be run on the deafult configuration of the OS. IMHO, MS has really dropped the ball on this one by saying it could happen to anyone, and not even providing any information to it's customers about the incident (as of 8am PDT, May 5).<p>

I was channel surfing and saw someone on CNN(?) saying that there were now personal firewalls which were like the corprate firewalls of old. People could get access to your files over the internet, and it happened every day. The speaker implied that these firewalls would have prevented this problem. I nearly choked.
