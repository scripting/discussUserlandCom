This is the flaw in Brett's reasoning, he assumes a cause and effect that may not be there in compilers and editors.<p>

A good example, the spreadsheet is now a feature of Office packages. It used to be a standalone product category. Not no more.<p>

Open source had nothing to do with it. <p>

It could be that text editors became full featured editors like BBEdit or word processors.<p>

BTW, UserLand uses Metrowerks and Microsoft commercial development environments. I assume this is because they're the best choice for developing on Mac and Windows, respectively. I doubt if the money had anything to do with the decision, and believe me, we never want to change the compiler. That's *their* job. We already have enough work.<p>

OTOH, I dislike reasoning that works the other way, making sweeping claims about damage commercial developers have done. Usually they talk about Microsoft. They are not the only commercial developer. A lot of open source advocates seem not to know this.<p>

Further, when leaders like Eric Raymond say that Mac is a lost cause, that's a blowoff for Mac developers. Think for yourself. There are still a lot more Mac users than Linux users. If your goal is to create an independent and healthy and diverse group of non-Microsoft developers, you can't afford to blow off any sizeable market.<p>

I have some credibility here that I didn't used to. I now use Windows fulltime. I could adopt Raymond's position, but far from it, I keep investing in the Mac, for the same reasons that Unix developers should. If you want diversity, include everything, exclude nothing.<p>

And btw, that includes Microsoft.
