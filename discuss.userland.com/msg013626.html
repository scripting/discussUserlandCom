At the very least, they should have at least thought about the SS connotation. However, I am willing to give Vignette the benefit of a doubt in this area.<p>

If the debate is on merits of the content management packages (Vignette vs. Frontier), sticking to a discussion of the features seems the best way to make the point. In reading the features oriented posts, I am a bit closer to understanding that Vignette might be assembled from virtual glue and toothpicks. I believe these sorts of exchanges do more for Manilla, Frontier and the community than arguments on what may or may not be a poor product name. <p>

Thanks for hearing me out. Peace.
