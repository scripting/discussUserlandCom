Well thanks...but its mostly just because I'm lazy :-) All this nasty hand coding of HTML tags is just too much for me.<p>

I was playing around with a Manilla site and the first thing I thought of was "Why can't I add stories from Pike?".  I think it would be great if I could enter a series of site urls into Pike and then autenticate and edit directly in Pike.<p>

On a realted note...<p>

Is there any chance that Pike will be opened up so I could, for instance, code my Cold Fusion pages so that they communicated with Pike for data entry/modification? Or is this already handled by XML-RPC?
