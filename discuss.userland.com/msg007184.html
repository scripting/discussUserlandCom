There's still a little marketing slime in us.<p>

Your suspicions are correct. It is a way of driving traffic and page views...sort of. Our first priority is reader experience (happier readers, more visitors). We were concerned about the path of directing readers through the main pages, but they do get the benefit of all the main page goodies and in 18 months of operation across our journals we've gotten (at least until now) no complaints about that aspect of our design. <p>

But there's no question that, whenever possible, we do want to drive page views and the decision to pump readers through the primary pages does reflect that. We'll probably keep it as-is unless there's a measurable amount of reader complaint, in which case, we'll change it.<p>

Oh, and on the plus side, the news articles do take you right to the news page (even though nearly every fiber of my marketing being really wanted to send readers through the main page).<p>

One final comment: the link off My.Userland.Com is more experiment than anything else (even tho it is tre cool). I was experimenting with "shareables" as part of our need to do the My Netscape channels we wanted to run. And even those are more because some of our constituents like hearing that we've got stuff on Netscape rather than any traffic building process.
