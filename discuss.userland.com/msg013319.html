It also provides a link to the official site, put up by Comedy III Entertainment, which seems to own the name. Here's the story:<p>

I couldn't find any info on any of the sites about use of the images or sounds, but there seem to be a whole lot of sites using the images and .wav files.<p>

The "official" website seems to be <a href="http://www.threestooges.com/">http://www.threestooges.com/</a><p>
