For me, one of the coolest uses of MailToTheFuture would be to have it send reminder messages directly to my cellular phone.  While I do spend a fair amount of time at my desktop machine, I carry my cellphone everywhere, and even use it as my pager now.  <p>

I have tested this idea with a similar reminder service at <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/remindme/"><a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/remindme/">http://www.arsdigita.com/remindme/</a></a>, and it works <b>really, really</b> well -- well enough that I have become instantly addicted to it.<p>

However, when I tried the same experiment with MailToTheFuture, the message never made it through.  The reason?  My cellphone can only receive messages up to 120 characters in length.  The MTTF message I received looked like this:<p>


Mail to the Future message from <a href="mailto:mrich@u.washington.edu">mrich@u.washington.edu</a> created on 4/27/99.<p>

Evergreen meeting - Weds 4/28/99 - 8:30 am<p>

 <p>

For more information see <a href="http://www.mailtothefuture.com/">http://www.mailtothefuture.com/</a>.<p>


The message buffer was completely filled by the header and decorative dashes, and the actual reminder message about my meeting never got through to me.<p>

So, my suggestion is to put the header stuff at the end of the message, and to keep the initial 120 characters free for the message itself.  <p>

The arsdigita site mentioned above works fine, but I'd love to be able to do the same thing in Frontier, instead.<p>

Cheers,<p>
