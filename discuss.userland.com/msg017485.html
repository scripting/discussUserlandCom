You should listen to KFOG. It's far from perfect.<p>

Aside from that, I'm not copying the music, just listening to it. I know some people abuse it, but I'm the kind of person who buys stuff. Just check my credit card. <p>

These were the arguments that the software users made that persuaded all the software developers (well most) to take off copy protection in the 1980s. I know the kids are copying the music. But they're missing the boat with the rest of us. The Web and music were made for each other. They're focusing all the attention on the people who steal. I wish they'd look for some fun stuff we could do, before I get too old to care.<p>

Remember the game you did in the 80s and how miserably Merv Griffin treated you? If only they would have worked with you. PhrazeCraze was addictive. I wasted many hours playing it. Too bad Merv was such a stinker.<p>
