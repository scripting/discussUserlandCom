He has Microsoft Word <a href="http://simonfell.manilasites.com/2001/04/12">uploading</a> to Manila via SOAP 1.1. <i>Bonk!</i><br><br>Rob Fahrni, who works on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/visio/">Visio</a> at Microsoft says: "Once Visio 2002 ships you should add it to your Killer Apps for XML-RPC. Visio will now save files as .XML natively if you choose to do so, we call them VDX's." I asked Rob to send me an <a href="http://static.userland.com/gems/scriptingNews/sampleVisioFile.xml ">example</a> of a VDX file and he did. It is XML, and it looks like we'll probably be able to do some interesting stuff with this, perhaps generating these files from our outliner?<br><br>Jake's SOAP <a href="http://jake.soapware.org/currentXmethodsResults">interop matrix</a> is lookin pretty <font color="darkgreen">green!</font> ";->"<br><br>Ken Dow is teaching <a href="http://www.kendow.com/manilacourses.html">Manila courses</a> in Toronto in June.

After compiling a flat list of topics people wanted to discuss, he tried to reorganize things into categories, and all of a sudden everything got slow as he copied and pasted text to do the reorgs. To an old <a href="http://www.outliners.com/">outliner</a> user like me, it was painful to watch, and even more painful to think of how many people are doing face-to-face meetings this way. <br><br>Thanks to <a href="http://www.evhead.com/?archive=2001_04_01_ev.xml#3188292">Evan</a> and the <a href="http://globalarchive.ft.com/globalarchive/articles.html?id=010404001363&query=speedle#docAnchor010404001363">Financial Times</a> for the link to <a href="http://www.speedle.com/">Speedle</a>.
