That makes sense to me.  I'd like to sign up to be an affiliate, but I don't want to get updates on all channels, just the ones I deem my clients/users/customers might be interested in.<p>

As for doing it without XML-RPC, it sounds like Akilesh has enough to do XML-RPC, if not with Cold Fusion, he might be able to do it with my ASP code (although there are a couple of server dependencies that might trip him up).<p>

His follow-up question:<br>
<i>I want to use a scheduled task to run a script in a language like Cold Fusion. I'd want this task to read over XML files at regular intervals (like Userland), and use the chunks of information for    various purposes:
</i><p>

What he's describing is a reversal of the way that the Aggregator-Affiliator relationship works.  In his scenario, the affiliate requests updates, rather than being notified of updates.  The problem I would percieve with that is one of potential load on the Aggregator.<p>

I think he could set up an affilate (I'm contemplating the ASP code myself -- I'm still wrestling with how VBScript treats Dictionaries (<struct>s)), and it's easy to extract the relevant information.  The only question is what you do with it.<p>

As for a turnkey solution (which, I think, is what he really wants), I think it's possible, but we're not there yet.  Something has to be done with the data once you've got it, and that needs to be coded.<p>
