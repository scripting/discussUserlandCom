<li>I didn't request an SDK. If you had an open and documented communication protocol no SDK would be necessary.<p>

<li>It would be great if you would address the question I asked in the title of the piece. Why should AOL open up? Once you have the answer, apply it to Microsoft. And until you're open, your preaching to AOL is BS. Get busy on your open protocol. Then make proclamations and rally support, if you must. You're confusing a lot of people. You get no thanks from me for that.<p>

<li>To answer the question in your PS, I don't care about communicating with AOL users. An open system would force AOL to open up. I don't like battles between huge companies. I have MS's IM app installed. I think it's OK. I have a billion ideas for building stuff on it. I don't like the fact that I can't build on it. I'm pretty sure your IETF group will come up with something that's blindingly confusing.
