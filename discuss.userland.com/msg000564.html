It is great.<p>

It supports Javascript, and it has Java support through Sun's Java Plugin.  It supports plugins like any other browser, though sometimes the Plugin installers don't recognize Opera as a browser(this forces you to do it manually).  It also supports CSS.<p>

It works very well over slow connections.  You can independantly configure the cache for Images,HTML, and Other file types.  It also does all the SSLs.  <p>

Perhaps MY favorite feature is that all browser windows are contained within the parent.  I really hate using the larger browsers since they clutter my screen and taskbar with windows.  <p>

Project Magic(Used to be Opera Winfree) is a group that is porting Opera to most other platforms, Mac, Linux, OS/2, etc...  They are making good progress.  Lets hope...
