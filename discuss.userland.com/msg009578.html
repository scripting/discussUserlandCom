Other sites did it differently, you didn't like it (for various sensible reasons) and made your opinion known. But they had all the power to set their policies.<p>

Microsoft only has the power for their web standards. If there's a choice of writing to an independent standard or a vendor standard, the independent wins every time. It's a bad idea to give vendors too much power. They need to be reminded how they are still in business (because we buy their products).
