consider these issues.<br><br>
One is the book <a href="http://www.inforules.com">Information Rules</a> by Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian. Interestingly, one of the main things I learned from their book is that corporations habitually maintain too strong a hold on their intellectual property (in the sense that a weaker hold would lead to larger profits). Another is J. Bradford Delong, whose <a href = "http://www.j-bradford-delong.net">website</a> has many essays about the "New Economy" and how things might or might not be different. 
If you want more examples, I have them, but these are a good starting point.
