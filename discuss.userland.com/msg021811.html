I consider the discussion group a way to comment on topics mentioned on Scripting News.  I know you (Dave) occasionally read it and it's a way for me to tell you and others in the Scripting News community what I think without disrupting your inboxs.  At the same time I understand your concern about others dumping there do do on your site.  I think your policy of, "good fences make good neighbors" is the right way to handle things.  I would agree with the above suggestion that you become more of a lurker on the discussion group (although we'll be sorry to see you go) and concentrate on the News section.  I also wouldn't necessarily link any and all inflammatory discussion group messages to the news page.  I understand if your doing this out of a sense of journalistic integrity, but it merely exacerbates the problem, encouraging more inappropriate discussion group dumping.  I've never seen someone's negative ZDNet comment promoted to a front page story.  <p>

Lastly, with regards to contributing to the Userland/Scripting News community, I purchase annual subscriptions to Frontier for both Mac and Windows even though I have not yet mastered the program, because I want to support what you and your company are doing.  Thanks for the news, ideas, entertainment, and software.<p>
