I just had a Dell-sent technician here to replace my motherboard and the machine is better.  I only called them yesterday.  Yes, I had to go through a little hold time and listen to the Chernobyl virus stuff - and I had to go through the prescribed diagnostics to prove what I suspected in the beginning, but I expect that.  <p>

They overnighted a new motherboard to their service provider (Banktech) in Manchester NH, and the tech drove up, installed the motherboard, was friendly, and the machine works.<p>

However, I have heard third-hand stories that were less than flattering.  Nothing out of the ordinary for computers though.<p>

Your experiences are worse than anything I have ever heard.<p>

I still like Dell for PC's.  We've got a bunch of them.
