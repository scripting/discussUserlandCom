Here are the changes I made this morning:<p>

<ol>
<li>Added version attribute to storyList. Set to 1.0.</li><p>

<li>Corrected channelUrl, it was pointing to a non-existent page.</li><p>

<li>Added userLandChannelId to each story, so there can be a link between the story and the channel that's not based on parsing the URL, which could change.</li>
</ol><p>

<b>linux2.userland.com</b><p>

Re the location of the file, my intention is that all statically allocated files from My.UserLand.Com will go into that directory, and when they move, we'll work out a way to automatically redirect. I'd say the URLs are good for at least six months. We need to offload some of the serving, and that's a nice quiet Linux box that's going to do nothing but store static stuff for our NT machines.<p>

<b>Frontier programming trick</b><p>

I wrote a single bottleneck routine, finally, that handles all static storage for applications running on UserLand.Com servers. This means that when and if we should move this sub-site, we'll just have to change it in this one place. For Frontier developers, here's the source for the script:<p>

<pre>
on staticFileWrite (filetext, path) &#123; //returns the URL for the file
	local (basefolder = "L:\\static\\");
	local (baseurl = "http://linux2.userland.com/users/admin/static/");
	local (f = basefolder + string.replaceall (path, "/", "\\"));
	file.sureFilePath (f);
	file.writeWholeFile (f, filetext);
	return (baseurl + path)&#125;
</pre>
