The XML format isn't a format, really, it's just a data file -- a very barebones sitemap, for the most part.  Here's mine (located at <a href="http://q.queso.com/deepleap.xml">http://q.queso.com/deepleap.xml</a>):<p>

It's used for their little popup window's MetaInfo section, to provide what they call "standardized links" into your site.  If you've got a search engine that fits their format (very basic, and very easy to implement in Manila), then their search box will feed your search engine, and pop up your search results page, not their own (something that's very important to me, since I've worked hard on my layout).<p>

All in all, it's a neat tool -- and I bet that they have other tricks up their sleeve.  (I say that as a complete outsider; today was the day I discovered what DeepLeap is, just like most other people).
