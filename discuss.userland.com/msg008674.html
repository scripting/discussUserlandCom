<BLOCKQUOTE>And Apple's iBook consumer laptop looks pretty good too, although with only 32MB memory it will be
a slow machine. Apple laptops have always suffered from too-little RAM. Some advice to Apple, get
ahead of the curve this time, add more RAM. 128MB at least.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>

<br>I disagree for this particular product. It is a consumer portable!<br>I would never go to Burger King if all they had were double whoppers with cheese. I love them, but my kids can only down a simple cheeseburger.<br>You can always add more RAM if you need it. Why raise the cost for folks who only want to play solitaire & send email? (AKA: my mother-in-law) ;)</br></br></br>
