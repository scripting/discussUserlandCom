with digital images. I tried a variety of other programs for editing images
from my digicam, but I could never give up Photoshop's power. Friends kept
telling me to try Jasc Software's Paintshop Pro. I did, during the 5.x
series, and the 6.x series, and always found it lacking.<p>

I think that lack is over.<p>

I downloaded the public beta of version 7 of PaintShop Pro a few weeks ago
and it has everything I need to edit my digital images. I've gotten very
good with Photoshop's curves and levels, but I can achieve comparable
results with PaintShop Pro. Add the much better batch features of PaintShop
Pro and its innate Web-centered view of the world, and I'm very happy.<p>

Add to this the expense of Photoshop in the retail world (I bought all my
previous copies while working for an academic institution and hence got
educational pricing) and PaintShop Pro looks even better.<p>

Screen shots are a snap, too. I believe that's where Dave's first complaint
started....
