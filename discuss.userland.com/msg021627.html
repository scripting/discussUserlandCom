I had noticed the proliferation of cross-licensing and these papers give some good ideas why this may be.  I think you may have convinced me, especially in very dynamic fields such as software.  I am thinking there are some other reasons why cross-licensing takes place, but I like this information.

Yeah, that is a problem with patents on process or algorithm.  I usually assume that whatever idea I have has already been considered and implemented by others in the past.  (Well, I admit I have had a very few that I think are globally unique).  Patenting something like a business process seems ridiculous.  With scientific things like crypto algorithms, there is an established community of peer review, so determining uniqueness is a bit easier.  Then on the other hand, scientists tend to be motivated by things that patents don't attempt to guarantee.  I doubt that Newton or Liebniz would have worked harder if they had felt they could get a patent on Calculus.  Maybe _copyright_ is the real issue here...  I guess I am getting confused :-)
