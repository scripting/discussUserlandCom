Is there a possibility to give a link an aditional colour, when the page to which the link refers, is updated after the last visit?<p>

Shouldn't there be a feature to send information to browsers history lists, when the users have enabled that feature?<p>

I think an additional link definition would be needed as well as a way to submit the information. How could it be handled with static pages?<p>

I have posted this request at

but wasn't contented with the reactions.
