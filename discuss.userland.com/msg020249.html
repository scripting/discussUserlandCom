If I understand the argument, GPL deprives people writing derivative code from profiting from their creativity (that's the easy part).  Taking GCC for example, GCC has driven out the makers of <i>competitive</i> compilers by being "good enough".  Let's stop there for a second, and say, "wouldn't a TrulyFree compiler do the same?"  I would think so.<p>

OK, given that a TrulyFree compiler would drive competitive compilers out of the business, what is left is the ability for creative developers to add <i>marginal</i> value to the TrulyFree compiler by taking the TrulyFree compiler and making proprietary extensions.  I am sure there is great short-term profit available there.  But, the "problem" with open source, in general, is that there's always developers out there who are interested in improving the base of TrulyFree or even OpenSource software that they will eventually get around to making the same extensions TF or OS.<p>

Is this whole argument about short-term profits?<p>

Take GhostScript and Aladdin as an example.  For a long time they've kept a non-OS, non-TF, version of GhostScript available for licensing, and then make a GPL version available a year afterwards.  They're making their short term profit <b>and</b> releasing "poison pill" licensed software.  (Oddly enough, they're preventing a competitor from doing the same thing, with <i>Aladdin</i>'s software, by using the GPL specifically.)
