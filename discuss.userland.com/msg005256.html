(Even though I do 90% of my web development on mac - I realized that this needed to live in server land - where NT is more likely to exist)<p>

So I have it on my laptop now, and after I start learning it Ill move it to the group's NT server so we can start using it internally for discussion etc.<p>

My hopes are that I can shoehorn this into a project management tool with auto-generated sites for clients (extranet stuff).  Meaning, we have a project for X company. We want to share development internally in the group but also want a carefully prepared view of the site to be seen by the client (X) and to allow them to send back feedback.<p>

This is all experimental now - although we have nothing but email right now to do this currently.
