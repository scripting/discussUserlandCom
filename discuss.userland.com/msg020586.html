My own techie career started on the periphery of this industry and many of my friends are in the industry. You mentioned the two easiest industries to survive in a no IP world, the film industry is much more difficult to see in that world.<p>

A feature film takes a minimum of twenty or thirty people and often involves hundreds and occassionally thousands. The script can be performed on stage, but that is not the same as a film nor does it involve the same talent and people behind the sceen. Money does need to flow back to that talent.<p>

That being said, I don't necessarily agree with your analysis of music and software. Not all musicians want to perform, and I don't think they should have to play to earn money. Some electronic music can't really be performed as it is programmed bits and. Also, truly great software wouldn't need support.<p>

I still side with Napster and I also believe it should be legal for people to copy anything they pay for, like DVD's, especially when copying is necessary for viewing on Linux machines. I also hope that the web changes the model so that the talent that creates an artwork (I will include sw as art.) receives a larger portion or even the entire portion of the revenue created from the work. Nonetheless, I think a world of free information with great software, art, music and film is a pipe dream unless we expect even more artists to be the stereotypical "starving artist."
