is a preview relase). It's an NS4 security hole, which is
much worse. Right now the only solution is to turn off
plugins and/or turn off Java. As I understand it the problem
is that the Netscape JVM or some Java classes running inside
of it don't perform a security check that they should. Netscape
has announced that there will be a patch soon, but I haven't
heard an ETA for that.
