This works because it is a private and low-volume forum.  I would like to implement this in Frontier's Discuss. <p>

I have figured out how to send a message to each member of a group, but am stuck about listing the authors with subjects of the day.  I'm concentrating on mainresponder.discuss.listDay as a model, but get stuck because it assumes HTML so can return "msgReader$39", for instance, as an item.  I need the value of this link so that it will appear in plain text or as an HTML link with a plain text link name.  Perhaps one of you has already done this or could help me think through this.
