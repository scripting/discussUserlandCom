But the reality is that the artifacts will be bought and sold
for as long as the dominant paradigm is that the artifact is more important than the process which created that artifact.<p>

Which is where we stand tody, like it or not, and is my reason for

solution for now, while the real problem (of changing the dominant paradigm of billions of people - not a problem for programmers alone to solve) still lurks out there.
