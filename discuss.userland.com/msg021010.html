a license change in the first place.  Chronology of events:<p>

* Versions of Python up to 1.5.2 have an X11-inspired and GPL-compatible license that the community is happy with.<p>

* In May 2000, GvR and 3 other developers (the Pythoneers) leave
CNRI for BeOpen.<p>

* Preparations continue for Python 1.6, now renumbered 2.0, aiming for a beta release July 1.<p>

* A few hours before the 2.0b1 release, CNRI says "No, not without a different license."  *Why* CNRI thinks a new license is needed has
never been made clear.<p>

* Weeks of negotiation follow between CNRI and BeOpen; happily, in
the meantime development on the code continues.<p>

* CNRI insists on a 1.6 release that contains the Python CVS tree
as it was in May, when the Pythoneers left.  (Python 2.0 contains
the development from May until today.)<p>

* CNRI's new license is longer and has various added terms, but 
doesn't really restrict what you can do with the code.<p>

* BeOpen asks Stallman for an opinion on the GPL-compatibility 
of the CNRI license, because the Pythoneers think it's important.  Stallman points out some problems; all but one of them are resolved
by changing the CNRI license.<p>

* One questionable term remains: CNRI and BeOpen think the term doesn't affect GPL-compatibility; Stallman and the FSF's lawyer
think it does.  <p>

* The Pythoneers finally issue 2.0b1 on September 5. 2 months of 
delay have resulted from this licensing struggle!<p>

* Someone raises the issue of the Python license on the debian-devel list.  LinuxToday picks up the story, then Slashdot, and now Scripting News. <p>

Note that RMS has not issued any broadside against Python, since
he's perfectly aware that negotiations are still ongoing; this whole tempest came from the single debian-devel posting by someone else.  This isn't an example of RMS being inflexible; 
instead it's an example of how clueless management can severely hamper 
technical work through legal wrangling and lack of understanding of the user community.
