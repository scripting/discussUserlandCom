Dave has suggested that it will be possible to wrap lines in an outline.  This will be a big help, but still does not provide a simple way to distinguish headers from formatted text - which ideally could be indented under the containing header or optionally exdented.  An outliner that offered paragraphs as included objects would greatly facilitate my ability to organize ideas and improve my writing.
