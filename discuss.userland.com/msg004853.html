In mainResponder.root.members.logonForm it says you invoke this as a macro. I tried putting it as a macro in a template (and I have templates working, and the web server is turned on). It constantly says cannot execute the macro becauser it can't find it, no matter what path I try (logonForm, members.logonForm, etc. inside macro braces). Perhaps I am doing things the hard way, but I don't see how to get started.<p>

Thanks for any info--erik
