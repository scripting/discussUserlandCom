yep ... it's happened before, but I hope Apple is moving away from their old business model of 'next big thing' marketing.  Dell makes a lot of money without having done one single 'big thing' and I really hope Apple will get better and better at cross-platform products and solutions.<p>

Examples of what I like from Apple; 1) MacTCP gave me access to the Internet, 2) PCMCIA slots reduced my modem cost, 3) QuickTime is a success because it is cross-platform.  There are plenty more.<p>

Mac Only is NOT a good feature in my opinion.  I love using my Macs, but I will only get to keep doing that as long as they -FIT-IN-.  I almost always choose a cross-platform solution over a Mac only option.<p>

dws.
