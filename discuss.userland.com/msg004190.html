Actually, nope. HFS, AppleTalk, and Netinfo haven't been
OpenSource. Nor have NeXT's OO driver technology or the ObjectiveC runtime. Or NeXT's SoundKit classes (which are
pretty stale now, having been written for the black boxes.)<p>

It'll be really nice if Netinfo is ported and integrated
with other platforms like Linux and NT. It's always been
a bit of a very attractive freak.<p>

It shouldn't take too long to get the Darwin stuff running
on Intel (or other platforms). What you'll have then is
basically OSX/Server without a UI - a console-mode Apple
Mach/Unix box. (There is a rumor that OSX/Server may ship with a
lot of fat binaries and fat libraries which contain Intel code
in addition to PPC. The theory is, these could be copied to
a Darwin/Intel box, and you'd have an Intel box running
MacOSX Server - GUI and all.) The Darwin code appears to
include a lot of code NeXT put together for HPPA and Sparc,
in addition to PPC and Intel.<p>

Once a console is up, it shouldn't be too long before X-Windows
and various Window managers start moving over from Linux. At
this point, there will be little practical difference between
Linux and Darwin-plus-XWindows.<p>

Why didn't they use Linux from the start? My guess is that
they like some features of Mach that Linux doesn't support,
like Mach's messaging. Their ports to NT, HPUX, and Solaris
have required software to take the place of these Mach
features, which has occasionally been a bit klunky.<p>

So instead of moving their upper-level stuff to Linux,
they're trying to turn the lower-levels into a Linux-like
system. The end result should be about the same as replacing
the lower end with Linux, with the added benefit that Apple
stays on technology they're intimately familiar with.
