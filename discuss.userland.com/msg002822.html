Each has special strengths based on history and the talents and experience of the people who develop the software and the people who use it. <p>

Our history started with print publishing systems, then we turned to the web with an offering called AutoWeb, then we tried to turn the web into a productivity application and realized that turned the sysop into a bottleneck, and then we moved to the web as groupware.<p>

Our focus is and has been on the writers. Our product provides technical underpinnings for a systems person to put together a customized editorial system for a group of writers. Over time that is becoming more polished and turnkey. Along the way we've turned our framework into a dynamic serving environment, but primarily for the content development process, or for deploying a not-too-heavy-trafficked site.
