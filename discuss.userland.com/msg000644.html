It is not a big deal to support the Mac but the view
from outside looks like they go out of their way not to
support it, even saying nice things about the fact
that Java runs on the Mac or that Sun has never had to
twist Apple's arm about full JVM compliance.<p>

With the way that Apple's JVM is evolving, I expect it newer
versions (MRJ 2.1) and later to run Java platform 1.1
code faster than typical Windows hardware with Sun's
own JRE.
