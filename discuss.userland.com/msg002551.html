Well, fate (and a new client) is bringing us back to the new Frontier, the content management system.<p>

Our client wants us to create a virtual office for them - online. They have ambitious plans for a dynamic website, with writers/contributors scattered across the country. i know that Frontier 5 and soon 6, will be able to handle their needs for the website. However, they would also like to use a web browser for managing their email, instead of a traditional email client (like having their own Hotmail). i can think of two possible solutions: use Frontier to communicate via AppleEvents, with a traditional email client or write a client in Frontier to communicate directly with the mail server. <p>

i was wondering if anyone has done this or is doing this or has some insight that would help me to do this. Thanks for all your help.<p>
