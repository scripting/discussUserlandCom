various glitches in the data.  I hacked together a Python script that churns through the 300Mb of data and outputs a corrected version that
xmlwf reports as being well-formed XML; look for xmlfix.py at 
<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/amk/zope/ODP.html">http://starship.python.net/crew/amk/zope/ODP.html</a><p>

It would be nice if the data was available in smaller chunks.
I'm working on a ODP viewer for Zope, and have 
a shell-like tool for editing the data; a slide about it is at
<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/amk/zope/odp-slides/sld015.htm">http://starship.python.net/crew/amk/zope/odp-slides/sld015.htm</a> .
This tool would let you read in the full database, delete chunks, eventually add new material, and then output RDF for your modified version.  Slapping an XML-RPC interface on top of it should be relatively easy; I hadn't thought of that.<p>

All of this stuff is still unfinished and unreleased.
