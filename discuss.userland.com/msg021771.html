<p>Often people are not trying to define you or pushing your opinions. Often they are just making remarks about a specific action or statement. Nothing more and nothing less.</p>
<p>Discussion based on reason is supposed to improve the knowledge/wisdom of all parts involved. Isn't that the point of most online forums?</p>

<p>Have fun</p>
