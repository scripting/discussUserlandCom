But I wanted to install windows 2000 professional because it's I've heard it's much more stable.<p>

Now I've installed windows 2000 and frontier still runs ok, but when I try to connect to my website <a href="http://www.legalaccessworldwide.com">http://www.legalaccessworldwide.com</a> in my browser, it says the page cannot be displayed.  However I can connect using my IP address. <p>

My domain name is active.<p>

Is there anything I need to setup to make windows 2000 or Frontier recognize my domain name.  Does frontier have to be setup with IIS??<p>

I don't think the problem is with frontier because I can't run my ftp server or my email server either.<p>

Any pointers would be appreciated.<p>

Thank you, <p>
