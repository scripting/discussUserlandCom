Following a single thread is fairly difficult here (unless I've missed something somewhere, which is possible).  I don't know if I've mentioned it before, but I like the way that <a href="http://www.lugnet.com">Lugnet</a> does it... at the bottom of each message is a tree you can follow and also the option to show all messages in one thread on one page.
