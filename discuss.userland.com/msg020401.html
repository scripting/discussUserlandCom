And Tim O'Reilly might be more willing to support commercial developers than one might think. As a software and book publisher, has a <i>lot</i> to lose if the GPL takes root more than it has already. Alas, he does not hear much from developers like us. If he heard their side of the story, he might well become a strong ally. Other potential allies are Bill Joy (who worked on BSD in the early days and built SunOS around it), PC Magazine editor Michael Miller, and Jeff Bezos.
