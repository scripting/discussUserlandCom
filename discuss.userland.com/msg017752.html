What is a portal?<p>

What is the difference between a portal and an aggregation server (eg My.UserLand)?<p>

What role does RSS play in defining a portal?<p>

My definition of a portal would be any site where user content is customizable.  So a portal to me would logically include RSS channels since channel selection seems to be the most obvious and perhaps accessible way to customize content.
