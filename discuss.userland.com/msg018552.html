I've loved the Byrds music all my life.  I had no idea he'd been so screwed by the labels, but I'm hardly suprised.<p><p>

Last year I <b>purchased</b> the Byrds' 4-CD boxed retrospective (which is superb), for about $40.  Bet he didn't make any money off that, either.<p><p>

Like I said in this space months ago, the old-line record labels are a bunch of thievin' weasels who have been ripping off you, and artists, for decades.
