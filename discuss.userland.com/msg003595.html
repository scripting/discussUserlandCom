Yes and no.<p>

We've had cable modems here since August 97 (we were beta testers), so we've seen a lot of growth in that time. If you have a reasonably intelligent operator they'll have budgeted to plan for this. Subscriber growth should lead to infrastructure growth.<p>

About a year or so ago, we noticed that things would start to slow down over a few weeks, then we'd have a brief outage, and then things would be back to as fast as they'd ever been. Since then, they've learned how to upgrade without the brief outage.<p>

And yes, our cable system (MediaOne) also has a similar silly subscriber agreement. However, we haven't exactly been subtle about the fact that we've networked everything together, and we've never heard a peep from them in the last 19 months. It's not as if they have the manpower to go door-to-door, looking to see who's running what inside their houses.</ul>
