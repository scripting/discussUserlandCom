Someone just posted a question <A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/39C99EE3.D5D0E553@mac.com">here</a> about it when trying to build the Mac version of Mozilla.  The <A href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/mac.html ">page</A> links to ftp.scripting.com which no longer exists.  I seem to remember a post on Scripting News a few months ago that ftp.scripting.com files got moved somewhere else, but I've spent a few minutes searching and couldn't come up with anything.  (I did find this thread though :-)<p>
