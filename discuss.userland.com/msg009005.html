I applaud the idea that we ought to admit that<ol><p>

<li>Running servers costs money<p>

<li>If we want to do interesting things with them reliably we may need to
have some public servers which we all pay for
</ol><p>

This has added benefits<ol><p>

<li>As a matter of public policy we could decide to allow free usage to some
institutions (such as schools or libraries)<p>

<li>More important, we could get away from the idea (which has nearly
destroyed television) that everything on the Internet is about making money.
We seem to have forgotten that lots of things people want to exchange
information for have nothing to do with making money and shouldn't.  Nor
should such transactions necessarily be supported by mindless and instrusive
advertising (which, if we can believe the statistics, most people don't read
anyway).
</ol><p>

There are lots of good commercial uses for the Internet and there is nothing
wrong with the using the Internet to enable them (remember it isn't so long
since we didn't allow such transactions onto the 'net).  But there are lots
of other things that we need other ways of supporting.  Maybe we should be
looking at how to fund such usage as well as the public policy problem of
funding internet access for the HaveNots.  Now that could be a good lively
discussion!<p>

Best, as always,<p>
