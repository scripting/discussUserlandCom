I would also comment that, while outlining is restrictive, it seems to be a core human (or, at least, Western and I don't think I'd leave it at that) model for organizing information so that it can be retained and communicated easily. Not the only model, but one key model.<p>

It also ties intimately to modes of "summarization" of knowledge and information, another key tool in the all-too-small human arsenal.<p>

We do need tools for jumping nodes but only if we realize that this produces nearly as much cognitive dissonance as it resolves through unexpected connection-finding. And sometimes more.<p>

This might be weird, but think of Joyce's Finnegan's Wake as an example of a node-jumping (breaking?) web. That isn't a knock, to say the least! But one wouldn't want to use Finnegan's Wake as a map within ordinary reality spaces ....<p>
