About the glossary, dream up a feature. Explain how you would like it to work. The site has a glossary, but we don't use it for anything right now. I could write a script that adds all the channel names to the glossary, so you could refer to "Jacob's Angst" and have it hotlinked automatically. Is that what you had in mind?
