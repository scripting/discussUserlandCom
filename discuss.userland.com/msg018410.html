That is entirely other than informal hotlisting and cross-linking (a good thing, to say the least), but isn't that already happening everywhere on the Web?<p>

I'm not ranting but asking -<p>

How purposeful can community be before it subverts its own purpose?<p>

(Related questions: who gets to be the gatekeeper and why? If the gatekeepers are the "group", do group "ratings" generate anything better in the long run than the least-common-denominator stuff that already poisons our culture?)<p>

There is an inherent degree of serendipity in Web-learning that routes around this kind of thing.<p>

Put another way, the "noise" (purposeless-ness) that comes along for the ride is part of the dynamic. Can you have purpose without the noise as well? One person's grasp of "purpose" often looks like a waste of mindshare to someone else.<p>

Serendipity is something more than "sheer luck" but something less than planned organization. I question that you ran into Greenspun, Winer et al through dumb luck. You were "routed to them" by a series of learning experiences on the Web. This doesn't make the clumsiness of the Web something mystical, to be sure, but maybe it isn't quite as clumsy as we imagine?<p>
