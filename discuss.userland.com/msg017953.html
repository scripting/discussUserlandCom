OK, that argument. <p>

There's a difference. I go directly to my users with the software. No middlemen. If anyone's ripping me off it's the users. At this time I don't let all my software out for free, but I do let a large portion of it out for no charge, gratis. I think you even use that software. <p>

Aside from that if I were a musician making no money, with no hope of ever doing so, would I let the music out for free? You bet I would, and I did, in 1995, with Aretha. <p>

If I were a musician I'd record two versions or do two mixes or do a high-res and a low-res version. One is free. Have fun. The other costs money. Go deeper.<p>

I'm not going to ask your question because it's totally unclear what it is.
