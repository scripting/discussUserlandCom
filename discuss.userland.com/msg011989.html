"An example of openness in action with XML is at Userland Software. The people at Userland were heavily involved in XML-RPC and have since been making their servers open for developers to use to construct services. The result has been a growing community of people who help test Userland's ideas and software, contribute to it and provide complementary functionality. Userland has thus got a high profile as a company that knows about connecting applications together, despite its small size." <i><a href="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/turt.mov">Cooool!</a></i><p>

"The way things are shaping up I am thinking hard about rolling my own, because right now I have a need that I cannot fulfill from outside sources. Yes, not Invented Here strikes again, but I can't find a solution. Am I alone in this? What do you think? Do you have any solutions?" <i>Somebody, please tell them about "XML-RPC".</i><p>

Hey XML-RPC is getting <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=99/10/13/0251239&cid=15">rave reviews</a> on SlashDot. <i>Let's go Mets!</i><p>

"People make the mistake of letting Windows NT suggest the default Pagefile size for your system. This is the amount of memory in your system plus 12 megabytes. This just isn't sufficient for today's applications. As a result, your system will perform rather poorly in just about all cases."<p>

Here's some synchronicity. The Wired channel broke <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$12002">because</a> their redirector can't handle commas in the URLs, and they just switched over to <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.vignette.com/">Vignette</a>, which of course puts commas in the URLs. <i>Murphy lives at Wired tooo!</i><p>

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/04/05/HailThis">4/5/97</a>: "The press only knows three stories, Apple is dead, Microsoft is evil, and Java is the future. And they only ask two questions -- Is Apple still dead? Is Microsoft still evil? Let's ask the third question." <i>Replace all Java with Linux.</i><p>

Another quote: "This Java stuff is an interesting distraction, but the future is still the web." <i>Still true.</i><p>
