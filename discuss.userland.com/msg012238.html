Thanks to Mark Kennedy for the <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/FAQ.pl">pointer</a> to the W3C FAQ. It could be infuriating if you need help from a human being, but I don't so it's really interesting how they're doing it. Check it out. <p>

<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-922281.html?tag=st.ne.1002.thed.1007-200-922281">Jeff Bezos</a>: "We spent thousands of hours to develop our 1-Click process, and the reason we have a patent system in this country is to encourage people to take these kinds of risks and make these kinds of investments for customers." <i>Double-talk. If Bezos was pro-customer, he'd avoid using lawsuits to lock customers into using his servers to buy books.</i><p>

Fortune: <a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/fortune/1999/11/08/ama.html">Amazon vs Everybody</a>. "In Bezos' vision, Amazon.com will be the center of the e-commerce universe. Books, pet food, tennis shoes, banjos--whatever e-shoppers want, they can buy it, or locate it, on Amazon.com."<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$12255">York University</a> is doing a major Frontier project, I've seen it, and it's huuuuge. Not surprisingly, they're looking for more Frontier developers.<p>

<a href="http://www.fanas.ch/">Simon Garland</a> runs a Frontier-managed website just down the road from Davos.<p>

<a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg102299.htm">Dan Gillmor</a>: "Y2K -- wow, there's a surprise! I mean, who could have seen it coming?" <p>

<a href="http://news.userland.com/y2kwatch">Here's a page</a> that tells you in gory detail how little time is left is before our reality shifts.<p>

<a href="http://www.pythonware.com/people/fredrik/hotair.htm">A man piloting a hot air balloon discovers</a> he has wandered off course and is hopelessly lost. He descends to a lower altitude and locates a man down on the ground. He lowers the balloon further and shouts "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?" <p>

I have been invited to keynote <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.seyboldseminars.com/">Seybold/Boston</a> in early February 2000. This is quite an honor. I plan to talk about our "Edit this Page" vision for website writing, and our work with O'Reilly and Microsoft.<p>

And there are firmed-up plans for me to go to the <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.weforum.org/activities/annual_meeting/">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos, Switzerland, the week before Seybold. This is the conference that Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Rupert Murdoch and John Markoff go to. What's going on? All of a sudden I'm "in".<p>

And finally there's <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www9.org/">WWW9</a> in Amsterdam in May, where I am co-chair of the Distributed Computing track. This should be a great meeting for the melding of different protocols into a web of applications that cross OS, scripting and economic boundaries. Script writers rule the world! (An old slogan, but still a good one.) No more Uber-OSes. (Another good slogan, still working it.)
