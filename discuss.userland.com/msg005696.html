I've been creating sites and writing scripts in 5.1+ for maybe 3 months. I just recently upgraded to 6.0 because I wanted to get more into dynamic sites in the area of collaborative knowledge construction and access.<p>

My problem is with accessing a suite that is either in frontier.root or some gdb like "suites.root."  I have installed the xfile suite (www.spinwardstars.com/frontier/f5/xfile.html).  It works fine in 5.1.4, but now that I am moving my Web sites to gdbs, the suite macro call no longer work.<p>

Does anyone have any ideas or pointers to good documentation. I can't say that I have a good understanding of scope in the new gdb model.
