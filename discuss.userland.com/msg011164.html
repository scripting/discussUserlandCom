There are many many people doing far more better and interesting stuff than Microsoft, plus a lot faster.  For example, looking at the XML-RPC homepage there are 9 implementations now available for various platforms all without Microsoft's intervention.  Didn't Microsoft help write the spec? Yet they do not have it implemented in any of their products.
