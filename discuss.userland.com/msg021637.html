Interesting idea again.  One consideration is that companies could take out patents to prevent others from using the patent commercially, while the company taking out the patent would have no intention whatsoever to use the technology at all.  I believe that auto companies have done this with engine technologies in the past.  So like you said, would take some creativity to implement without too many loopholes..
