But the name of the channel is a link, in the "choose your news page".<p>

so I open that link in a new window to check it out, before subscribing. <p>

I agree that the list of channels is getting long, and many could improve their little description blurb. <p>

when I find that I like the material a channel is giving me, I usually add the source page to my news favs. A lot of the benefit of the links is the commentary about them, which I don't usually get from the channel table. <p>
