I don't think the issue of killing is central. But a related
effect is important, and this is that killing is final.
People and things are truly diminished when ended permanently.
This is why murder is such a big deal, compared to battery.</i> <p>

Josh Allen: <i>
OK, so this is the main disconnect. We both agree that humans
have an unalianable right to exist. On the other hand, you see a
company being put out of business as the same type of crime as
an individual dying, while I do not.</i><p>

(To nearly agree with your statement, I must change your wording
to either being-put/crime/being-killed, or going/tragedy/dying:<br>
<ul>
<li>being put out of business ... crime ... being killed, or
<li>going out of business ... tragedy ... dying.
</ul>)<p>

Perhaps our disconnect is caused by my expectation that
companies do not die unless they are finished off by
either competitors or really bad management.  I would expect
instead to see companies doing badly to become smaller and
weaker, without going completely out of business.  Basically
I see no reason why an existing business cannot make a good
seed for a re-emerging business after a mistake.<p>

However, a company that was once a thorn in the side might
become so again in the future.  A thorough competitor might
prefer that this not happen.  So when a former nuisance
becomes weak, it might see prudent to finish it off by one
means or another.  However, I see this as immoral action.<p>

Just as an example, the only reason Apple did not go out of
business is because Microsoft showed mercy.  This surprised
some folks, but I knew it was a necessary play on Microsoft's
part, since it would have made the denial of monopoly an
untenable position to present.  If it were not for this
critical situation with monopoly status, I would have expected
Apple to get bumped off.<p>

Note this line of thinking on my part allows you to construct
an ad hominem innuendo, that I now trash Microsoft out of
resentment over past conflicts.  Since I've now done this for
you, I pray you refrain from doing so.  (I find ad hominem
implications annoying unless stated baldly.  They are valid
criticisms when relevant, so they're not always fallacious.)<p>

Josh Allen: <i>
I believe that the natural process of the market killing off
companies and having the humans continually follow the
collective market demand is the best way to effectively
protect the "right to exist" that individual human beings
have.</i><p>

I think the Darwinian metaphor causes a misleading assumption
that companies naturally die off just like individual members
of animal species. But corporations are granular, and composed
of separable resources that can be downsized.  I'd expect
companies to most naturally become weaker and retrench after
mistakes, rather than dying.  So I see the Darwinian metaphor
as a sophist justification for murder. :-)
