I'd agree.  It was amazing to me to find canals in Milan.<p>

<i>It amazes me that such beauty can exist in a city that I would otherwise describe as urban hell.</i><p>

<i>ps: Thanks for posting that great link to the Lonely Planet Guides!</i><p>

They <i>are</i> just very cool and clued-in guides.  I think Dave would like them.<p>
