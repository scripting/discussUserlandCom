Now all the code to implement the discussionGroup is part of mainResponder.<p>

A new table of scripts, mainResponder.discuss.<p>

A new website, makes the discussion group just like all the other tickets.root websites:<p>

<a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/tickets/discuss/">http://nirvana.userland.com/tickets/discuss/</a><p>

This will eventually become discuss.userland.com, probably early in the week.<p>

The alternate home page has a demo of the feature that allows a discussion to start from a news item:<p>

<a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/">http://nirvana.userland.com/</a><p>

It's trivial for us to allow discussions to follow from any tickets.root based item, not much harder for any other site do it, for example DocServer.<p>

Things are starting to tie up at the top level, it's very slow going, every decision is using practically all the code in mainResponder. But I'm doing the work, slowly but surely.<p>

The next step is to come up with a wrapper for all pages, so that you can access your preferences record no matter where you are browsing, edit a message you created, log off (your cookie is emptied out), start a new thread, or whatever makes sense. <p>

That's why the templates are so plain so far, because the wrapper is going to be a very low-level thing and apply to all pages.<p>

PS: The "First Discussion Group" interface will continue to work, until it breaks at which time I will delete it. (It's not going to be maintained.)
