An army is only as good as the infrastructure that supports it. At some point, it will come to the point that he will feel that the loss of his tools of power are not worth the cost.</i><p>

another aspect is that most of the money and power in
serbia is concentrated on a small elite ("100 families")
who currently support milosevic.<p>

destroying the infrastructure is the same thing as
destroying their assets, and it's not clear if milosevic
can hold on to his position if/when he loses their
support...<p>

btw, did anyone even notice that the US attacked Iraq
today?  business as usual, I'm afraid...
