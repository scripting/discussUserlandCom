This is a wonderful idea in general, and your point about Linux companies (<i>It would be great to see some of the Linux companies with their huge stockpiles of cash to make an investment in documenting prior art...</i>) is particularly good. <p>

What do you think we could do quickly? I'm just thinking off the top of my head...could a Frontier website work as a frontend to an IP database? Or a Zope site? Or a SourceForge account? If we can come up with a first-pass idea, I've got time, bandwidth, and disk space. I'd lean towards Zope; it runs on the Linux box I'd be thinking about using...(plus I think it's neat! *wink*). What do you think?
