I'm the guy who decided to risk a fair bit of his
personal money, along with our (Verticality Investment
Group) investors' money, to back Digital Creations. Only
after the money was in their bank account, did we discuss
Open Sourcing Zope, so it wasn't a condition of investment.<p>

So, as a person who stands to lose a lot, I should be one of 
the most concerned about "competitors" using Zope, right?<p>

It turns out that this is not the case at all. I
whole-heartedly welcome your use of Zope, and will do an
awful lot (within reason) to ensure that you are successful
in whatever ways you use Zope. Why?<p>

When we discussed making Zope Open Source, there were a few
key things that everyone needed to be laser focused on.<p>

1) Officially, we were becoming a Services company. The
services are only based upon Zope, and there is no general
"work for hire" at Digital Creations. Specifically, that
meant that the bulk of our revenues would come from
consulting contracts.<p>

2) Zope would remain free, and Open Source forever.
Customers couldn't (and shouldn't!) adopt Zope if they
didn't believe that we'd continue to enhance it at our
expense for as long as there remained a reasonably sized
community of users.<p>

3) Additional revenues would be derived from vertical
products that were developed on top of the Zope
framework.<p>

So, are we (UserLand and Digital Creations) really
competitors? I think not. First, we don't charge for
Zope. So everyone who wishes to buy a "competing" content
management system, Portal Toolkit, Web Application Server,
etc., should buy it. We don't lose any money from that
sale.<p>

But we could lose potential Services contracts from that,
right? Of course. However, we have zero salespeople on staff 
at the moment, and get more unsolicited requests for work
than we can credibly bid on. This highlights the point that
I wish to make (but haven't yet):<p>

In a Services world, there is infinite work available. We
are competing with no one (IMHO). We aren't even aware of
the vast majority of work available out there, and if we
lose a consulting assignment to another Zope shop, good for
them! If they aren't a Zope shop, then we didn't convince
the client that our solution was better, and that's entirely 
our problem, one I won't blame on having competition.<p>

Only #3 above gets into the realm of true competition.
Products. We offer a few add-ons to Zope at the moment.
There's no question that some of our own community of
developers may wish to offer similar add-ons, possibly even
for free. We encourage that. In fact, those that buy the
add-ons from us at the moment agree to a license which
permits us to Open Source the add-on at any time, including
the day after they purchase it. Hopefully, they realize that 
they will benefit from other add-ons that were developed
with OPM (other people's money) and then Open Sourced for
their benefit... So, add-ons aren't a big revenue stream for 
us either, just a small, partial cost recovery system for
some leading-edge R&D.<p>

Larger revenue will come from vertical products. Here too
competition is possible, especially from non-Zope shops. We
welcome the opportunity to display our wares head-on in this 
arena, and if we get beaten, so be it. In this regard, we
have one product (which we don't yet advertise in any way).
It is a web-based workflow engine that is flat out more
flexible than anything on the market, simply because it
automatically acquires all of the strengths of Zope's
dynamic framework! Therefore, we don't offer "workflow in a
box" solutions, but rather a perfectly tailored (custom)
workflow app to a given customer's requirements. We have
deployed one already, and the raves are already coming in
:-)<p>

Again, thank you for adopting Zope for your efforts on
Linux. As you already saw with the XML-RPC collaboration, we 
are more than willing to help in any reasonable way, and we
hope that this effort on your part will be rewarded by many
more people joining the UserLand fold!
