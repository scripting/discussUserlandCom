<blockquote><i>"To suppose that cathedral-style development could manage this trick when the low entry barriers and process fluidity of the bazaar cannot would be absurd. If what it takes is one person with one good idea, then a social milieu in which one person can rapidly attract the cooperation of hundreds or thousands of others with that good idea is going inevitably to out-innovate any in which the person has to do a sales job to a hierarchy before he can work on it without risk of getting fired."</blockquote></i><p>

This is hyperbole at its worst. Eric should go look at the "closed source" projects that yielded high creative results. He'd find that when development works, people's creativity is encouraged, we rally behind the person with a vision, and no one gets fired. Sure there are lots of Dilbert-led companies out there. And there are a lot of bozos doing open source projects too. <p>

Basically, in defending his friends, he has gone way to far in attacking people who could also be his friends. Like I said, he's not a work-together guy.<p>

Now, I'm on a panel with Eric on August 24 at the O'Reilly Conference, talking about open source of all things. I hope to turn his head around!
