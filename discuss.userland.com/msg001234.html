The trial which was thrown out not because of Clinton's testimony, but because the judge ruled that the claim was groundless.  Clinton was not accused of a crime, he was sued in civil court.<p>

Was it the trial before the grand jury that was held at Ken Starr's request?  It seems to me that the grand jury trial was a fishing expedition designed to cause Clinton to perjure himself.  We certainly haven't heard anything more from the grand jury, who actually heard the testimony.  Clinton was placed in a position before the grand jury where he knew he could not plead the fifth for political reasons, which is what any person would do under normal circumstances.  You shouldn't have to testify about your own alleged offenses before a grand jury.<p>

Obviously, Clinton has done some things that by any measure are wrong.  But I believe that the wrong things he has done have been inflated by the partisans who have wanted to remove Clinton at any cost since he was elected.  <p>

We have a means by which we can remove elected officials who don't bear our standards for morality, or who do things we find personally reprehensible, it's called an election.  Going beyond that means to nullify a popular election is an extremely grave task, and I've been appalled that this entire impeachment has been used as a tool for forwarding partisan agendas, rather than as an unwelcome task that bears close scrutiny.<p>

Look at the vote in the Judicial Committee, all of the articles were passed on pure party lines.  I think you'll see the same thing in the trial on Thursday (more or less).  There's something very wrong here.
