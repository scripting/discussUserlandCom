This latest would probably be a good case for a class action negligence lawsuit based on the fact that there are well known solutions (from simply disabling certain enclosures to sandboxing), that Microsoft has long been aware of those solutions, and has not done anything to implement those solutions.<p>

The fact is, it should <i>not</i> happen to any software.  Time to bring that to vendor's attention.
