It clearly shows Apple did the right thing for 8 of the 11 extensions it supports, but did not do the right thing for 3 of the 11.  A version resource didn't list the 3 extensions in question.  Probably just a coding oversight, or a typical cut-and-paste error when updating the program or something.  But if the Apple plug-in doesn't specify that it plays qt, vfw, or aifc files, exactly how should IE guess that it does?
