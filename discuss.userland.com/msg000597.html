It's come to my attention that not everybody is as comfortable with their search engine as I am. I've got two tips:<p>

1) From the popup menu #2 "Select your search criteria" -- make sure you've switched from "Exact Phrase" to "All Words." (Default is exact phrase, which is rarely effective.)<p>

2) You may need to do two searches. Look in #3 "Choose your search category." The default is to search everything except for Support and the Knowledge Base. But -- if you're searching for technical information, much (if not most) of the time you'll find what you're looking for in the Knowledge Base.<p>

So I usually start by choosing "Support and Knowledge Base." If I don't find what I want there, then I switch back to the default "All of Microsoft.com."<p>

By searching twice you search everything, starting with your best bet, the Knowledge Base.<p>
