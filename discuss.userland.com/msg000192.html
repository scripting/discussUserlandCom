Mine was over 26,000 lines long!<p>

I just deleted and recreated it by typing the following in the Quick Script window: new (outlineType, @user.scheduler.log). <p>

Then I did a File/Save Database, and instead of taking 30 seconds it was done as soon as I let up on the menu. <p>

Yay!<p>

Now, of course, I will put that on the list of things to address. There must be something we can do about this. <p>
