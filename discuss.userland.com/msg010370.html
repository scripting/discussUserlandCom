OK, point well-taken.<p>

I added a "sometimes" in there.<p>

BTW, I really believe that's true. I play the game with myself. When I have a criticism for someone else it usually turns out to be something that I am critical of in myself.<p>

Check it out with your favorite psychologist or Buddhist or even a rabbi. It's a pretty common belief. But it is just that, a belief. None of us have a clue how someone else is. But we all sometimes believe we "know" what someone really means. Ooops! There I go, doing it again! (It's been a long day.)
