Most weblogs are not made up of headlines; they're made up of paragraphs.<p>

We're building RSS support into Blogger (<a href="http://www.blogger.com">http://www.blogger.com</a>), but to do so, we have to make the interface much more complicated for those who want to use it, with three form fields for each post, instead of a single textarea. It feels like a bit of a stretch to make most blogs fit into that format. <p>
