They're all available thru the update process, and logged on this page:<p>

<a href="http://developers.userland.com/changes">http://developers.userland.com/changes</a><p>

<b>Motivation</b><p>

A separate virtual domain, one that isn't part of userland.com, wants to have member-based services, running on the same server as userland.com. The cookie for the other service will be totally independent of the cookie for userland.com. There's no way to work around this, as far as the other domain is concerned, userland.com is unreachable. The architecture of the Interet is cool, and it's annoying presence is felt deeply in the bosom of mainResponder.<p>

<b>Solution</b><p>

OK, that's the motivation. Now the solution. If you want to have a site that requires membership, you can provide a #urls table, that links to the member logon pages. The four values that must be present are: <ul><p>

<li>memberCheckMail
<li>memberHome
<li>memberLogoff
<li>memberLogon
</ul><p>

If you also want a discussion group, be sure to provide the URLs for the DG in this table.<p>

I'll post an announcement of the new site in a bit. I want to do some more cleanup and documenting work. I'll also be releasing source for this app.</li></li></li></li>
