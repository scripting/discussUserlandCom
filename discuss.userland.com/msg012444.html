But it has quickly evolved into a syndication hub that combines, or aggregates, the new stories from over 440 channels into a single flow of new items. Hence, My.UserLand.Com is known as an aggregation site."<p>

<a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.xml.com/pub/au/Dumbill_Edd">Edd Dumbill</a> is the new Managing Editor at XML.COM. Edd is a friend of UserLand. The developer of <a href="http://usefulinc.com/xmlrpc/">XML-RPC for PHP</a>, he's always the first to help us test new interfaces. We like Edd because he makes software; having him as a leader at XML.COM is good news for XML. Congrats to Edd, and congrats to O'Reilly and Seybold, the co-owners of XML.COM.<p>

NYU: <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/perlin/demox/Face.html">Responsive Face</a>.

We have a placeholder for ads on <a href="http://www.salonherringwiredfool.com/">SalonHerringWiredFool.Com</a>. I got the ads by taking a couple from each of the four sites (they're actually making money on every hit right now). Of course we want to run our own ads on this page. I'd like to start with charities. If you know a worthy cause that has a standard banner ad available, we'll run it for free for a limited time, and probably will always include charity in our mix.<p>

<a href="http://www.linux.com/ads/">Linux.Com only</a> runs free ads for the Linux community. Here are some <a href="http://www.linux.com/banner_view.phtml">samples</a>.<p>

<a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/stories/storyReader$67">Jim Roepcke</a>: "I loved running my own BBS. That's one of the reasons I was so attracted to running my site with Manila. There's basically a BBS, at least the part of BBS'ing I like, message boards, included in the package!"<p>
