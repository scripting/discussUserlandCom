Well, I never paid much attention to the analysts anyway. :-) They get paid to have lots of opinions, and sometimes the quality suffers.<p>

On a more personal note, I've been wrestling with two aspects of open source:<p>

<ul>
<li>I'm a programmer, and I want to make a good living writing software.</li>
<li>But I'm also a user, and I like the control that I get from open source.</li>
</ul><p>

Can you imagine a musician who wants to make money, but also wants Napster to be legal, somehow? It's certainly not an easy dilemma for me to resolve.<p>

I've been spending the past year wrestling with these issues, and I've reached a tentative conclusion: It <i>is</i> possible to make a very respectable living as a consultant who develops open source software. And open source software is a very effective way to attract new consulting business.<p>

So if you're a programmer, you want to make money, and you don't want to work as a consultant, open source may have nothing to offer you.<p>

But if you <i>do</i> want to spend your time working one-on-one with a few individual users, you can build some great relationships and make plenty of money.<p>

So open source may not influence <i>whether</i> programmers make money. But it certainly can affect <i>how</i> they go about it.<p>

Does anyone else have any contrasting viewpoints?<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
