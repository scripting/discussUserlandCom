(By the way, I agree that Dave should be able to post anything he darn well pleases on his site.)  This way of creating not-quite-independent discussion threads seems odd to me.  Is there some way to post a note that's not anchored to some other note in the discussion server?<p>

What's doubly confusing is to not find my "How to push..." note and its responses listed in the topics.   There's an odd chain of links that could maybe be easily touched up.  On <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">http://www.xmlrpc.com/</a> there is a "leave a message" link at the bottom of the page to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$947">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$947</a>.  Odd that it links directly to a particular message...  If I click the Topics link on that page I get a rather thin list of topics.  Finally, if I go straight to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/">http://discuss.userland.com/</a> I get a list of recent subjects, which seem to have little to do with the list of Top-Level topics.<p>

This isn't a complaint, just an observation or request for enhancement.  At a minimum, I think the link on the XML-RPC page should simply be to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/">http://discuss.userland.com/</a>.  I'd also like to know how to start a new topic or if that's reserved functionality.<p>

XML-RPC looks cool from what I've seen.  Assuming the performance is okay I'll probably discard our homegrown "RPC" mechanism in favor of it.  Even if the performance isn't quite what I'd like, I have some C code that is a modification of Python's fast marshal module that could be easily modified again to speed up the XML encoding and decoding of objects, at least on the Python side of things.  Some Perl wizards could probably then smash that into a Perl module of some sort.<p>

Thanks,<p>
