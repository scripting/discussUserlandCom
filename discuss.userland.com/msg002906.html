How about making the glossary XML-RPC aware?<p>

Normally, user.html.glossary is the "end of the line", as far as the glossary-lookup-chain is concerned.<p>

But how about a #glossaryServer (table) directive, that html.refGlossary (?) would look at it?  The table would contain the info needed to ask an XML-RPC server to try to translate a glossary reference into something else.<p>

This way you could have a global distributed glossary.  In your case for SN, you'd want to host it on the dynamic server, and use it with #glossaryServer on the static server.<p>

There's lots of missing pieces to this idea as I've presented it, but I'm not the XML-RPC guru you are, so if you're interested in this idea, I'd rather see you guys architect it! :-)
