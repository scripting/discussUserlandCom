I wrote it to keep our tech staff up to date on what was happening out there on the wild and wooley internet.  As far as I know it was the first animal of it's kind.<p>

Regarding fair use: I don't think a court case has yet ruled on search-engines and headline aggregation sites.  They will someday.  Our stance is that if someone wants us to remove them from our harvester, they just need to ask and we will.  We have found it to be the case that the sites we harvest appreciate the traffic we send them, and our users enjoy the one-stop-shop.<p>
