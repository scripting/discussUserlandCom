excerpt:
"HARRISBURG, Aug. 19 –- Pennsylvania consumers would be the first in the nation to receive better legal protections and recourse if they purchase a defective computer under legislation introduced by state Rep. T.J. Rooney, D-Lehigh/Northampton.<p>

At a Capitol news conference today, Rooney outlined his bill that would establish rights for consumers who purchase defective computers and provide legal recourse for warranty abuses and ineffective repairs."
