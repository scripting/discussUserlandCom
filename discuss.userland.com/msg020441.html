This is a classic memetic problem. In order even to get equal time, one must create an equal sense of urgency. And the urgency, in this case, is <i>warranted</i>. Stallman's empire -- the hoard of software controlled by the FSF -- <i>already</i> rivals Microsoft's in breadth, depth, and lines of code.
