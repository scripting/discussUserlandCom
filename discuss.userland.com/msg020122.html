They bark, they fart, but they are also intelligent, which often leads to them becoming neurotic.<p>

Have you ever looked a chihuahua in the eye? There's no there there -- dead eyes, like a goat (have you ever noticed that? It's life Jim, but not as we know it).<p>

Ah, but when you look a _poodle_ in the eye, it looks right back at you with a sparkle in its eyes. Or an evil glint, depending on how neurotic it is. The so-called Standard Poodle is especially intelligent, although why they are called "standard" is beyond me, they are the big boys of the poodle world.<p>

And besides, poodle is easier to type!
