None of the new stuffs on Nirvana works on double byte language.<p>

I have hacked around the Discussion Group and make it works with Chinese characters (I don't have a chance to try it on other double byte languages, but I assume that it wouldn't be difficult to make it work). It's not elegant, I have to say. Some of the incompatibilities are very easy to fix. For example, the htmlInterfaces of the discussion group uses "&nbsp;" to make spaces, but the HTML entity wouldn't work in Chinese. So, a solution would be to set an option to use another string as the whitespace.<p>

But there is a much bigger problem underneath. The WSF is generally not double-byte friendly. Just turning on auto url alone probably will break many double byte pages, not to say pages that has macros.<p>

While I understand that there are many things Userland needs to do, but I would like to make a suggestion. If you guys ever want to address this problem, instead of try to patch here and there, please, PLEASE make Frontier support Unicode. And, if XML is such an important thing to you guys, you really should support Unicode anyway.
