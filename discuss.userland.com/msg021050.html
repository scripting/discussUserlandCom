I am a commercial developer because I was an open source developer (resume building). I want to use open source code where it makes sense so I don't have to reimplement it. I push for my commercial code to go open source so that it's useful for others (when it makes business sense to the company). I also push for it to be open source so that <b>I</b> will always have access to it. <p>
