One of their aims is to mislead the reader about the GPL's intent and function. The preamble claims that the GPL is intended to promote "freedom" when it really is designed to hurt developers. If the purpose of the GPL were to promote freedom, it would be as short, simple, and clear as the MIT X license. (This would also "free" the reader from needing a lawyer to understand it.)
<P>
I agree with you when you say that the GPL creates barriers -- in particular, between commercial and non-commercial programmers. This is one of the many reasons why I advocate the adoption of the MIT X License as the standard license for all open source.
