The table of addresses that config.domains.default points to is where I've been trying a host of different values for that table's "default", none of which worked. <p>

When I leave "default" out of the site address table and type in the URL <a href="http://myservername/">http://myservername/</a> I get a listing of the site address table.<p>

Things almost work the way I want, all I need is to find a way to map a pathless URL (just the <a href="http://myservername/">http://myservername/</a>) to a particular page.<p>

Well also, I'd like things like entering <a href="http://myservername/logbrowser">http://myservername/logbrowser</a> to still work. When using this table of addresses, now I can't access logbrowser using that URL (a gdb which is not open).<p>
