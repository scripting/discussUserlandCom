Scripting News bulletins seem like a pretty good feature. Sort of like pushing a "weblog" to the readers. I definitely would want to have this feature for users of my pilot personalized portal. I'd get really  excited if you could put a filter on the news content so that it e-mailed me when something appears in Scripting News relating to a particular topic or subject. Creeping incrementalism? Well I saw this feature in a demo for some portal provider.
