A computer program, or a music file, or any other bitstream is just a (really big) number. But in order to enforce this artificial scarcity, the IP laws say that I cannot tell anyone else this number. The free flow of information is blocked!

Information is easy to copy, but information is often connected to things that are <i>not</i> so easy to copy (such as the labor involved with producing a CD).  In such a case, the information inherits some of the value of the item that it's connected to.
