This time last year I did some work to reverse-engineer the protocol that the myQSL client uses to talk to the mySQL backend, and I implemented a client inside Frontier using the TCP/IP verbs.<p>

As the job I was going to do with mySQL didn't quite eventuate I stopped woking on it before it was compleely finished, but it shoudl only be a few more hours work to have a Frontier function that takes SQL text and returns a result table, if you're interested.
