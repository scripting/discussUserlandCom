"Customre Communication Preferences" is a link to a page where you can do just what you want to; tell them not to share your e-mail address.<p>

So, they've provided you with a means of opting out of communications. They've also informed you when their policy has changed. This is common practice, not cluelessness. Also, the e-mail they sent clearly stated that it was an automated message; how can your lawyer act on that?
