I can not beleive this will hold up.  If it does then all common sense is gone.<p>

Is Xerox , its Stock Holders and the employees of Xerox (and other photocopier and scanner companies) libal because the created the equipment that allows the copyright infringment.<p>

What about VCR and CD-R manufactures, etc.?<p>

Nonsense, the orignal ruling against Napster was wrong, they do not have copyrighted material on their servers.  They only have an index to material, is a card catalog in the library illegal?<p>

Is the CDDB (CD Database at <a href="http://www.cddb.com/">http://www.cddb.com/</a>) illegal, they have the name of almost every CD, it's artist, the track names, etc.<p>

The real problem is our government and legal system need to be educated and shown (again) that innovation is not a crime.<p>
