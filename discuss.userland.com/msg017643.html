Microsoft's closed shop and closed corporate mind are the real reasons they screwed themselves in the court case, will continue to do so during appeal and are likely to do so in the industry when the playing field has been leveled to some degree.<p>

This is the real test of whether Gates really learns from mistakes, but it has to begin with his personal acknowledgement that he made one (and not just an operational mistake but an ethical one, in the old-fashioned cultural sense of that word). He has shown zero evidence of that to date. <p>

If he learns quickly, Microsoft can secure a fair settlement (IMO) and maintain earned dominance (contra unearned monopoly) for another few years, at least. There are plenty of elements in the .gov (not only legal but House-Senate) who will put instant pressure into place for a settlement, but Gates is not giving them even a single bit of "cover" to this point.<p>

You are correct that a Microsoft-offered settlement should include offers to release source code in various domains. Ironically for those who loathe Redmond, this will increase, not decrease lock-in long-term - but it will meet some of the legal requirements.<p>

My gut feeling is that Gates actually does believe he/Microsoft are being unfairly persecuted and that he will resist to the end, in the conviction that the Supreme Court will be "fair" to him.
