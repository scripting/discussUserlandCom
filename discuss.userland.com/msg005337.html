If you like Linux mark yesterday on your calendar. It was a big day. Thanks to Jim Hebert, a Linux fanatic who we had crossed swords with in the past, he single-handedly got the Win32 binary version of Frontier running on Linux. It wasn't that much work! <p>

From his <a href="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/earlyfrontieronlinux.png">screen shot</a>, which got more complete as the day went by, we can see that the majority of Frontier runs fine thru WINE, which is not an emulator. Now I have to go to Fry's and get a copy of Red Hat and work with it here. We were originally thinking it would take a year to get Frontier on Linux. Now, dare I say it, it might be a matter of months or weeks. <i>Remember Murphy!</i><p>

Hats off to the <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE people</a>, btw. What an accomplishment! I think that running Frontier thru the WINE process will make it better. Now I want everyone on Linux. <i>Human nature, I guess.</i><p>

The WINE Is Not an Emulator <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5335">thread</a> continues, with some observations on human nature, invalidating questions we don't want to answer and continued subserviance to Our Lord Murphy, which reminds me, we need a <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5344">religious shrine</a> on the net, with case studies.<p>

I wish I had thought of grabbing this <a href="http://whois.userland.com/$famouslastwords.com">domain name</a>, early on.
