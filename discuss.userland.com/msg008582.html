8/26/98: <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/08/26/allAboutBees">All About Bees</a>. "A lot of people thought when I wrote this piece that the Bees were symbolic of Be Inc. To the best of my knowledge, they were not."<p>

<a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=beos&d=v1">Be IPO'd today</a>. They got their money. <i>All is well!</i><p>

News.Com: <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,84-39481,00.html?tt.yfin..txt.ni">Be Goes Public, But Doubts Persist</a>. <i>My opinion only: There's a niche for Be.

<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/07/20/DD43239.DTL&type=books">SF Chronicle</a>: "'There's rich, there's filthy rich -- and then there's Woodside.'
