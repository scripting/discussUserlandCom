You mention WebSTAR. But in Unix-land, there's AOLserver, which is faster and a better web server than Apache, yet only a handful of people seem to grok that.<p>

Open-source, like many other things, seems to help bring out the worst in people. Herds of people blindly following, and anyone suggesting something better is treated like a nutter or a traitor. (I prefer open to closed source.)
