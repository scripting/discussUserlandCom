The examples he provided have certain economic characteristics which make sense for the coercive use of government powers to fund them - such as defence. Economic cases can also be made for schooling and fire departments (though not as strongly as say defence.<p>

What Dave described ("public" information - to enable application development) did not strike me as the type of goods for which public monies could be justified.<p>

I was also surprised by Amy Wohl description that advertising has nearly destroyed television. A common misperceptioin is that free to air television is provided for us to view - when in fact, the audience is the product that is being delivered to marketers.<p>

That people want to exchange information freely is quite reasonable - it's a whole step further to advocate scarce public funds for that task.<p>

Cheers,
Christopher
