It basically accepts the same format I use to edit Scripting News. For the HTML rendering, it passes the text thru a template without any modification. For the plaintext version, it pulls out the URLs and strips out the <a "http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/href">s. Both versions run thru the website framework, an interesting application, since the output isn't going thru HTTP, it's going thru email. But it works, and macros and templates give me a lot of power to tweak the rendering without touching the script that does the distribution.<p>

We're also doing something interesting with the email sending, it's all asynchronous, another machine on our LAN is doing the email sending. The server sends an XML-RPC message to the mail machine containing a list of all the recipients for each version and the actual text that's to be sent. It's pretty dumb, it just emails to each of the recipients. But I don't have to sit there waiting for the emails to be sent to go on with my work, and the main machine isn't distracted from its job of serving web pages.</img>
