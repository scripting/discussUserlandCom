The problem I have with giving the award to a discoverer like Marco Polo is that someone else would have "discovered" those lands eventually. They may have changed the timing of the events, but it's not clear how much they changed the ultimate outcome.<p>

For most scientists, the problem is the same: if scientist X didn't discover what he did, another would have eventually, at least in our current "human wave" approach to science.<p>

That, however, may not be true for the really original scientific thinkers like Newton and Einstein. Newton seems to have single-handledly sparked the scientific revolution and allowed us to think about the universe mathematically and mechanistically (following up on Kepler et al.), so he sounds like a good candidate
