It gets worse: for some definitions of "rational," it's far from clear that an agent who lived forever would be able to act rationally. In particular, a Decision-Theoretic agent that lived forever would have no basis for constructing a meaningful utility function for any actions (basically, the problem of "why do at any particular time what you can literally put off indefinitely?") and without a meaningful utility function you can't reason Decision Theoretically. There's a great sidebar on this issue in <<a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0131038052">http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0131038052</a>>. In practical terms, this means that someone who is developing a Decision-Theoretic agent of some kind has to factor "death" (the system stops working for some reason) into the utility function for the agent ("it'd be good if I could do X before I die!")
