What's the right way to distribute some program/development in Pike though?  It doesn't seem to have suites, it doesn't really like GDBs (at least I can't seem to convince one to automatically open on startup AND be available for use in scripting... putting a db.open in the startup script seems to only half-work), and I hate to just start modifying things on <I>other</I> people's Pikes willy-nilly.<p>

I'm waiting for the plug-in spec, or some other description of standard distribution technique, before I get too deep into developing for Pike.<p>

In the meantime I've got some other interesting stuff going, so that's OK. "qbullet.smiley"  Maybe even later today it'll at least pop its head out for a demo (though I really should be doing some homework)...
