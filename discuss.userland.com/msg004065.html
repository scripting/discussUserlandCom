It seems to be this sort of thing.  I haven't been deep into it, but I have talked about it with my uncle, who is a novell developer. <p>

It does more than help your computer look and feel the same, it hooks you up with the priters, network services, data, apps, etc. that you need.  The whole thing sounds interesting.<p>

I don't know about any apps for Linux that support LDAP or NDS.  But I've heard It's no big deal to impliment into your product.
