When you send out an email to your subscribers, Manilla schedules a send and writes a message to the log saying it started sending the message.  When completed, it writes a log message saying that the mail has been sent, with xxx errors.  <p>

Perhaps a hitcount log entry could be generated each day.  That way a user like Joel could find out easily how many people are comming to read just the latest update, and how many are reading the whole series.<p>

To save space the whole log could be rolled over after a week or two.  Perhaps then it could be mailed to the owner, or whatever.
