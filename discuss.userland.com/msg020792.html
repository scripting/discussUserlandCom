In European countries (and some others), companies must tell you what data they store about you, provide access to it to you upon request (for a reasonable fee), and handle privacy-sensitive data in ways that are mandated by law. This is overseen by the Data Protection Commissioners, which can audit a company to assure compliance.<p>

We have no such protections in the States; once a company has information about you, they can basically hold it forever, unless you have a binding contract with them that says otherwise.<p>

This is interesting, because it gives European companies (or those which follow European practice, so they can do business there) a competitive advantage around the globe, as more people become sensitive to how their data is handled, privacy, etc.<p>
