<p>If he'd been convinced that 2600 was engaged in constitutionally protected free speech, DMCA or no DMCA, he could have ruled for the plaintiffs.  However, the First Amendment issue was hardly a slam-dunk, and we all knew that whichever side loses this case is prepared to appeal all the way to the Supremes.  So I can't fault the judge for focusing his trial on the facts and letting the appeals courts haggle over the constitutional issues.</p>
