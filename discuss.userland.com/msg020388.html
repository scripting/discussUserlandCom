I can imagine them making a mint off of this.  On the other hand, I can also imagine them discovering that the price that gets customers for the support service is too low to cover the cost of all the phone calls they get.  Back on the first hand, the more work they put into tools that simplify system administration (or at least, that simplify diagnosis of administration problems), the easier it will be for their staff to handle the support jobs.  Back on the second hand, Unix and Linux system administration involves <i>such</i> a rat's nest of /etc files, providing <i>so many ways</i> to hose yourself (I think I find a new one every month :-), that MacOS X may have the last laugh.
