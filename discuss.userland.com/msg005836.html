When the numbers get too far out of whack, return a message saying that ads are how you pay your bills, and suggest that if they want to read the content they must also get the ad. It won't be long until the servers do this, I'm sure of it. It's not hard. (Also, no cookie, no text.)<p>

An even better idea! When the numbers get too far out of whack, just return a text version of the ad in <h1>. That ought to get their attention!
