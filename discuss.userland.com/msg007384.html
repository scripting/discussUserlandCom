There's actually the xml-app mailing list, to quote the announce message sent by Don Park:<p>

"XML-APP is a mailing list specifically for those interested in applying the XML technology to real world applications."<p>

You can subscribe by sending a blank message to:
<a href="mailto:xml-app-subscribe@sunsite.auc.dk">xml-app-subscribe@sunsite.auc.dk</a><p>

Unfortunately the list so far has had quite low usage (especially compared to the xsl-list).  I'd like to see better usage of this list.<p>

There's quite a good list-of-lists at <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/xml/mailinglists.html">http://metalab.unc.edu/xml/mailinglists.html</a>
