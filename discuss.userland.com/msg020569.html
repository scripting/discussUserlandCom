Gave me food for thought. I can't agree with him that the GPL is unethical, but he has a good point that if you want something to be a standard, a license with no restrictions is the way to go. Worked for TCP/IP, HTTP...and people do seem to keep contributing source to Apache, even though it's BSD-licensed.
