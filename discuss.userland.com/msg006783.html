There is:
<ul><p>

<li>The <b>traditional</b> Frontier way, with pages as wp/outlines, catalogs (ie site structure) as tables and attributes in directives.<p>

<li>The <b>tablerenderer</b> version of traditional Frontier storage, where pages and some of the attributes also is stored in tables.<p>

<li>There is the <b>discussion group</b>, where pages & attributes is stored in tables (quite like the tablerenderer version). 
<br>Site structure is encoded into the "inResponseTo" and "responses". 
<br>Time (calendar) is represented in a separate index.<p>

<li>There is the <b>frontier.userland.com style</b> (the manual). Not released to public use yet, so I don't know any details.<p>

<li>There is the <b>Manila</b> style. Not public yet, but xml storage seams to play a large part of it.<p>

<li>Finaly, some people outside of userland seams to have their sites stored in xml, and use <b>xmltr</b> to render them.
</ul><p>

Now I'm pondering on building a content management system. If I want to stay in sync with Frontier development, which of theses formats belongs to the future, and which are going to fade away?</br></br></li></li></li></li></li></li>
