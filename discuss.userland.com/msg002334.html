and we could create Dreamweaver objects to make alot of the techy stuff on this page go away. But in the end we have not really created a usable tool for non-frontier designers.<p>

Look at the Dreamweaver integration for XSSI, Cold Fusion and WebObjects. These are real solutions. Dreamweaver renders the page as it would look if a server servered the page. That's what I'm getting at here. When I type in &#123;clock.now()} into Dreamweaver I want to see "1/21/99; 12:27:51 AM"<p>

If we had XML-RPC in Dreamweaver we can do this. We can tie all of Dreamweaver's tools into Frontier and make it a very smart front end for creating html for Frontier.<p>

I admire the simplicity of your solution. I just think Dreamweaver would have a lot more to offer Frontier if they could converse while the design was taking place, not afterwards.
