The people who use organizers are lawyers, doctors, professors, managers, people who are well-paid for their time. The assumption that the top of this category is $99 is another thing that keeps entrepreneurs out of the market. My beer-drinking friend is an ad guy. If he gets to keep a client because his team is more creative and better organized, is that worth $500 per year per user? If not, he should stick with word processors and spreadsheets as creative organizing tools.</i><p>

Hollywood professionals pay $15,000 to $40,000 for 3D visualization/animation software such as Maya, Alias, etc.  Software that only runs on very expensive SGI machines.  $15,000 for software!  There is an obvious reason why they will pay so much.  But it does seem like a product that helps other high paid professionals do their jobs in ways they otherwise couldn't would be worth $500-$1000 per year.  Maya costs $1,500/year to keep a current licence after you pay the $15,000 for it.  <p>

I may be wrong on some of my numbers here, but the idea is that there is a huge difference between $500 and $15,000, and not nessisarily a huge differnce in income of the professionals of the two categories.
