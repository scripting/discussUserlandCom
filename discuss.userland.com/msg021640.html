My 'guess' would be:<p>

<li>Most inventors lose control of their creation fairly early  in the process.  Thanks to lawyers. <p>

<li>Those who own patent portfolios don't have the good of mankind as a priority.<p>

But the fact that it hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't happen.  I am not aware if there are any restrictions of form governing licensing agreements -- which are contracts.  [I am not a lawyer.]<p>

The issues raised are particularly important when you consider software.  Most of the critical elements of power structure in a society are either process or information [mil/police the exception].  <p>

Both are easily captured in software.<p>


The act of building and using Software is <I>political</I>.<p>

Some examples:<p>

<LI>Presence Protocols [AOL/TIMEWARNER -- shudder!]
<LI>Electronic Commerce
<LI>e Money<p>

etc.
