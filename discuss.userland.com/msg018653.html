Yesterday I took a guess that Gil Scot-Heron's <a href="http://www.scripting.com/mp3s/theRevolutionWillNotBeTelevised.mp3">Revolution</a> is something that could be available freely, I thought it was a very appropriate thing to link to, as a toe-dip.<p>

I'm with Hatch on this, if you won't do it, let's do it for you.<p>
