This is not the case at all and is in fact why the Mac is relegated to such a small niche and MS Office is unlikely to be toppled anytime soon. In fact, in the real world, there is a huge benefit in being consistent with what others are doing whether it be in which OS, programming language, word processor, etc. There are very few situations today where a single individual can work in isolation and get much done. Groups and teamwork are quite important and rely on consistency as much as "out of the boxness". It would be difficult to hire someone whose attitude is "as long as it works for me, that's all that matters".<p>

Also, you make the case that a single Linux interface competing with Windows, Mac, Be, etc. is adequate.
