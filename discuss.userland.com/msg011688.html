Dave, you are partially right. RedHat doesn't have a really distinguish product to sell. You don't have to PAY for RedHat Linux, just download the installer and you can install RedHat Linux over the web, period.<p>

What you have missed is that, they are selling services, not products -- whether this is worth a $5.844 billion market cap is, of course, another story.
