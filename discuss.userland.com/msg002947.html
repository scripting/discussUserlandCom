This plugin causes <i>all</i> requests to get sent to Frontier. This is the same way Nirvana runs behind IIS, by getting all requests.<p>

The filter has been lightly tested, it's beta. You can download it here:<p>

<a href="http://209.181.141.42/frontierMirror/NirvanaFilter1.0b2.sit.hqx">http://209.181.141.42/frontierMirror/NirvanaFilter1.0b2.sit.hqx</a><p>

It includes a plugin and a new script, which will import into user.webserver.actions.Nirvana.<p>

To install the plugin, drop it in the Plugins folder and quit and re-start your server.<p>

In your server admin program, you'll need to create an action called Nirvana that points to the frontier.acgi alias.<p>

Then you need a suffix mapping to map .nv requests to the Nirvana action. (The .nv suffix is invisible to the browser and Frontier: it's just between the filter and WebSTAR. It's not seen by the outside world or by your scripts and websites.)<p>

Then go ahead and try out the server -- it should work as if Frontier itself were the server.<p>

Note: make sure Frontier isn't running as a server on the same port as WebSTAR or whichever server you're running. (Frontier doesn't have to be running as a server at all.)
