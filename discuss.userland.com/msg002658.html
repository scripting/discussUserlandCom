I have created a #search table in that site, as well as made the changes described in <a href="http://developers.userland.com/topics/searching">http://developers.userland.com/topics/searching</a>.<p>

From the Server->Search Engine menu I selected "Index Table" but got an error code 4: Can't find a sub-table named "data".<p>

From some other poking around, I think that is referring to the fact that my config.root lacks this: config.mainResponder.data. What's the fix?<p>

BTW, the menu command "Index Stored Pages" asks for a site name. Is that the name of the site table itself, or the value of #search.siteName?
