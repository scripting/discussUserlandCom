I'm not entirely sure if DOS is a valid comparision in this instance. <p><p>While it is safe to say that Windows 95 (less so than Windows 3.11) is based on DOS its really not as similar, in my mind,  to a Linux/ X Windows system.  My Windows 95 machine required <b>no</b> understanding or awareness of DOS but if I am going to run Nautilus, when it is released, I will need to understand Linux.<p><p>Even if Nautilus is a resounding success it still needs to run on an OS that is decidely unfriendly to install and maintain.<p><p>And I think this is the xrux of the issue. ESR can talk till he's blue in the face about Linux's superiority to Apple and Microsoft (a point I will not contest as its not germaine to this discussion) but until I can send my Grandma a Linux box and she can get the machine up and running by herself then Apple and Microsoft only have to fear losing technically oriented users and perhaps, in the case of MS, users of consumer electronics packages that use embedded OSes.<p><p>
