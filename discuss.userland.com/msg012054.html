The XML file was not being processed for some reason<p>

If I went to the Channel view function at <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1281">http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1281</a> old data was displayed but didn't give any indication of a problem (except that the update date/time hadn't changed) and until my test just now the aggregator(manual load) didn't give any indication of a problem either, but my memory may be faulty for the aggregator. Although I believe that the previous time I tried it, it processed my file.<p>

Just now when I tried to get the aggregator to load my update from this morning I received the follow error<p>

[Macro error: Can't get the address of "rss" because the table doesn't have an object with that name.]<p>

<a href="http://aggregator.userland.com/reloadChannel$1281">http://aggregator.userland.com/reloadChannel$1281</a><p>

Should I just redefine my channel to go to the old/same address hoping that fills in the missing data or is more required??<p>

My XML file is at <a href="http://www.PrivacyDigest.com/news/mostRecentNews">http://www.PrivacyDigest.com/news/mostRecentNews</a><p>
