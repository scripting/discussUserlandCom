Then since you own the copyright on the entire work (as you're distributing it), you can change its licensing terms.<p>

Of course, many people won't want to sign such forms; they do it for the FSF because they trust that the FSF won't take their code and then seal it off.  Getting that kind of trust built for a commercial entity which may be perceived as having incentive to close previously-open code can be difficult.<p>
