For being alive, filled with passion and more importantly - compassion.  For never stopping to believe in me.  For saying yes and being my bride this November 27th and letting me be yours forever more.<p>

My brother - For being a person I can count on when the chips are down, and for being someone to help me see life differently, from a different road to take.<p>

My brother's family - Katie, Matthew, and Brendan.  Lot's of love and a place I know I'm at home.  <p>

Richelle's family - For all the love and support they have given us this past year,  and most of all, for simply being Richelle's family.  It is one wonderful family.  <p>

My mom and her improving health.  Me and her are closer now than we ever were.<p>

My friend Steve, for helping me to 'lighten up' and stop stressing the way I do.  For showing me how to laugh.<p>

My friend Pat for having the heart of gold that he has.  No one I have met is so loving and pure in spirit.  For never being a cynic.  For being a dreamer and a believer.<p>

For my boss Rajiv - I got a great boss!  One of the best anyone could ever have.  An innovator, a thinker, a rebel.  Someone who has a heart and soul in his work and his life.<p>

For my career.  I'm blessed to be alive in a historic time and am working in a career that is certainly one of the most exciting places to be.  It is filled with trendsetters, teachers, inventors and real heros like Tim Berners-Lee, Larry Wall, Jonathan Eisenzopf, Randal Schwartz, Tom Christiansen, Eric Raymond, Richard Stallman, Cameron Barrett, Rob Malda, and yes - you too Dave!  The list is too big and wide to mention.  So many great minds and hearts working together from different sides of the same table.<p>

For everyone who has helped me in life to learn and grow, that list is too large to mention here as well.<p>

To God.  Thank you for blessing me.  I have good health, a good home, a good life, with love.
