More than one article talks about Civil War. This is good. No need to buy earthquake insurance. I'm going to buy plane tickets tomorrow. Definitely gotta go.<br><br>Today we had an all-day all-hands meeting starting at 9AM to talk about the top level of Radio UserLand. Is it a Web writing tool, a Manila-website editor, or the browser and writing tool for the World Outline? Yes to all. Now how to arrange the commands and windows so all its power is comprehensible to a newbie? That's our challenge. <br><br>Fairfax: <a href="http://it.fairfax.com.au/breaking/20001019/A61112-2000Oct19.html">Adobe.Com domain name relocates to China</a>.<br><br><a href="http://www.mindjack.com/feature/p2p.html">Cory Doctorow explains</a> why Intel's P2P workingroup meeting was a dud. My own theory of What Went Wrong is that Intel didn't lie well enough. Like <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera#ellison">Larry Ellison</a> in Que Sera Sera. But a lie is a lie whether you smile or give away warm fuzzy teddy bears. I actually prefer lies bold and in the face, saves the trouble of debating whether they're lies. That P2P needs a centralized authority is the lie, btw.<br><br>NY Post: <a href="http://nypost.com/sports/subwayseries/13383.htm">Red Hot Tix for World Series</a>. "Fans are going to have to dig into their deep pockets if they hope to see the Bombers play the Amazin's. Tickets are selling from $1,500 to $4,500 for box seats, $800 for nosebleed seats in the outfield, and as much as $800 in the bleachers. Tickets in the upper deck and the bleachers have a face value of between $160 to $50."<br><br><a href="http://2020hindsight.editthispage.com/2000/10/18">Susan Kitchens</a> tells the story of her trip to Ground Zero, with pictures.<br><br><a href="http://www.zeldman.com/coming.html">Zeldman</a>: "Network Solutions informed us that a character named Jeffrey Zeldman was attempting to modify the DNS record, and requested that Jeffrey Zeldman verify that Jeffrey Zeldman had permission to make this request."<br><br><a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/02/12/atoughcustomer#jokeTellingCamera">What ever became</a> of the joke-telling camera?<br><br><a href="http://qube.weblogs.com/2000/10/19.html">Luke Tymowski</a>: "Writing about the Qube also requires access to current products. Imagine writing about the great pyramids in Egypt having only seen a picture of one — you won’t get far."<br><br>Luke also says he gets mail saying he's "a loser because they take me to be some sort of Dave Winer <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=flunkey">flunkey</a>." I often wonder if the people who send me abusive email turn to people who are associated with me, people who work for UserLand, or who run sites I point to, like Luke's. In Jeff Shelton's essay <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/zopeNewbies/discuss/msgReader$805">yesterday</a> and Luke's today is a hint that they <i>are</i> getting abusive emails. <br><br>A word of encouragement to people who write publicly, passing on something that was said to me a few years ago by a journalist. Look at the Letters to the Editor page in magazines. You'll see abusive people saying nasty personal things about public writers. This isn't a new thing. If you go through it, you'll be a better writer. Not sure if this is true, but mean readers are a fact of life. Email makes communication easier, and that includes abusive communication.<br><br>
