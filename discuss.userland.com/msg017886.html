Port numbers below 1024 are reserved for "well-known" Internet services and aren't available for use in other applications that aren't implementing the associated protocol. In particular, port 81 is allocated to the "HOSTS2 Name Server" service. <p><p>

Port 8080 is reserved for alternate HTTP services. It is definitely the best alternative to running a HTTP server on port 80.<p><p>
