The paragraph seems to have changed, but I don't cache SN to be able to tell for sure. Anyway, your point was still valid. I imagine that InfoWorld's link policy page got many, many more hits as a result of your exposure regarding their policy. The Slashdot Effect from your posts may not have brought down their server, but the spirit was there...carry on!
