It's the best example of a photography-oriented Manila site, and it's fun! <p>

Ken's <a href="http://tv.cream.org/boredrate/wuname/wuform.html">Wu-Tan</a> name is "Radiophonic Skellington".<p>

6/15/99: <a href="http://www.greatvavavoom.com/stories/storyReader$9">My Uncle Ken</a>. "If you saw my Uncle Ken, you might believe that in a former life he was a professional wrestler. He has a big white beard and white hair, an enormously loud laugh, and is a great story-teller. In his stories he's usually the hero."<p>

When people hear the story of my uncle, sometimes they ask if he's like the Little Feat uncle (down in Puerto Rico) in <a href="http://www.littlefeat.net/TLAH.html#TLAH1">Time Loves a Hero</a>. Yes he is like that. "Left the States many years ago."<p>
