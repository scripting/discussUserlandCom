You are so right, but I am not sure if it will even survive till mid-2000. I basically consider OS X server dead when they announce OS X (they are actually two very different animals). Who's going to re-engineer their products for the OS X Server if they wait a few more months, they can basically do nothing (or make some minor changes to the codes) and have their programmes running on OS X?
