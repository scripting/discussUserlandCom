You mean that having consentual sex with one person
*proves* that he harrassed or abused another person?<p>

I find that a bit... absurd.<p>

Would a competent judge throw out the harrassment case

-- call that a lie if you prefer)?<p>

I haven't followed that case closely, but there must
have been more behind the judge's decision?<p>
