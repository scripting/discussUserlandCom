Even working in a 3rd party SOAP implementation layer was beginning to get more complicated than rolling our own XML-RPC one!" <i>Uh huh.</i><br><br>I added a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$7243#whyItsCool">Why It's Cool</a> section to the docs on betty.smtp.<br><br>If you're interested in SOAP interop, there is a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders">mail list</a> you must be on. We may have an easy <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1398?mode=day">way</a> for XML-RPC implementations to be part of the SOAP interop process. The whole thing is kind of a mess, with BigCo's having private meetings and paying huge money for marketing events. The important thing is to get interop and then if we want to honk the horn, slap each other on the back, and drink a beer that would be fantastic. But first let's get a spirit of cooperative development and teamwork. The beers will happen of their own accord when the time is right.<br><br>Well even the Enterprise wasn't the first space ship (actually it's a fictitious space ship). Lots of pushback, most of it respectful, some not (got it, ouch). Simon Fell and others say they've sent SOAP messages via SMTP and <a href="http://www.wiredfool.com/discuss/msgReader$117">Eric Soroos</a> did it with Frontier last year. Eric has blazed many trails in our land, and for that he has my respect and gratitude. Thanks Eric!<br><br>From the It's Even Worse Than It Appears Department, I got the part about the NG Enterprise being the first version that could be split in two, wrong. John Foster writes to say that the original one could split in two too. They just never exercised the power. It wasn't until Picard that they did the deed. Oh well. Zero for two. Whatever. Make it so. Beam me up. <br><br><a href="http://www.davosnewbies.com/2001/03/26">Davos</a>: "There was a popular myth current in certain circles last autumn: it didn't make a difference whether George W Bush or Al Gore became president, since both of them were centrist politicians with few important differences. The barrenness of this logic is being exposed on an almost daily basis."<br><br>"james kirk"<br><br>
