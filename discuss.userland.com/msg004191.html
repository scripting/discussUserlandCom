Your syntax looks fine. I'm guessing there are some issues to resolve on Netscape's end.<p>

Things to consider:<p>

Make sure your file(s) have world-readable access enabled. Netscape's RSS server needs to be able to read this entire file and index it on their server.<p>

Make sure you use compatible URLs. Netscape has a clearly defined set of rules to follow.<p>

I've noticed that if Netscape's server tries to read a file and can't it will not index it. I found this out when I their server tried to read my RSS file at the same time I was writing to it via FTP.<p>

An issue I'd like to see resolved is one of multiple URLs for a single "entry." Both Netscape's system and Scripting News DTD do not support multiple URLs for one entry. At least I didn't see any examples of this.<p>
