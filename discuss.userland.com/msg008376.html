Starting today that should no longer be true. There was a predictable order to the way the channels were being read, and the story list is reverse-chronologic. Your channel sorted out first because it had a number in the low 1000's and the names are not padded with zeros. <p>

Now we randomize the list so sometimes your links will be at the top of the hourly read, and other times they will be at the bottom and most of the time they'll be in the middle.
