This is the key to playing well with Apple, on several levels.<p>

One level is about integration; Frontier on the Mac plays well with any number of other powerful applications, via AppleEvents of course.<p>

I'm not familiar enough with Windows to know for sure, but I suspect that tying apps together with AppleEvents/AppleScript is easier than using COM on Windows, given that one knows equally little about either.<p>

On another level, namely marketing, fitting in will become easier when OS X is finally released (that the release has been delayed is not, to my mind, a bad thing). It means that I will be able to approach both large and small companies with UN*X based solutions. I can say "why wouldn't you put this box on your network, it's UN*X."<p>

It's a bonus that a) Frontier runs there and b) I can do this on the tiny but powerful G4 Cube, maybe running headless with Timbuktu; six months after the installation, nobody will notice it's there, all they will see is the applications I write. This is a Good Thing, imho.<p>

Also imho, the "It's UN*X" message is no small matter -- many of the larger companies are already predisposed to liking UN*X and historically it has a reputation for being "industrial strength".<p>

Granted, this will depend on OS X being as stable as other UN*X systems, like Solaris or xBSD. We know the history of OS X, it's based on BSD and the highly-respected if seldom deployed NextStep, and we know the engineering quality at Apple is high, so it's reasonable to expect it to be a strong implementation.<p>

<i>But I want this product to be appreciated and used in the Mac OS X environment</i><p>

I want both products to be appreciated in equal measure, by developers and users alike, for their respective strengths.
