Unfortunately, when you respond to these people and ideas you don't respect, you do it with hardly any thoughtfulness and enthusiasm.

Folks, this is what I meant by <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$12450">Too Many Editors</a>.<p>

This is a person who thinks he can invent a "Better Dave".<p>

See the problem? Here's a stranger, someone I have never heard of, offering me advice on how to be more like he wants me to be. If I were to take his advice, and your advice, and everyone else's, then there's no more me, just some washed out amalgram of all your neuroses.<p>

It ain't gonna happen so give it up.
