The FSF has managed to get people and companies to comply with the terms of the GPL out-of-court so far when it has found violations.  Other people (Linus Torvalds, for example) have allowed violations to a certain degree.<p>

I don't think anyone who uses it is especially anxious to court-test the GPL, and so far everyone has been mostly honest about the whole thing.  A determined person could really take it to court, though and then all this theoretical bickering about the validity of it would be over -- well, probably not, but there'd at least be the beginning of legal precedent.<p>
