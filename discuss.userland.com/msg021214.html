And it's weird.  I know I missed my father, but maybe I mourned it when we moved away.  When he was still alive.<p>

I meant to include all of that in my post, but I think I editted it out before I hit the button.<p>

Once again, thanks for listening, and Dave, thanks for creating the space.<p>
