Cringely: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit19990429.html">Hate.Com</a>. "There are more Eric Harris' in more places like Littleton. Their Web pages absorb emotional energy that might instead go into killing people. These cries for help can be easily found with a search engine and a peer counselor. In this sense, the Internet is part of the solution, not the problem. Why would we ever want to shut these pages down?"<p>

<a href="http://come.to/lightyear_media">Lightyear Media</a> has personal web server software for the Newton. This is an example of a Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server. People make fun of this idea, they're silly to do so, shows their ignorance, because HTTP is a powerful protocol, and it doesn't just have to be applied in the traditional client-server model.<p>

"Like eBay, Amazon allows auction participants to post comments about both buyers and sellers, although only feedback from those who complete transactions with an auctioneer can influence their 'star' rating. Nevertheless, knowing that anyone could post commentary about Cameraworld.com, regardless of whether they'd done business with the retailer, worried chief executive Alessandro Mina."
