A big problem with those sorts of services is dealing with bounced e-mail. He does it as a service for his friends and clients, and the public. But I'm guessing he allows the public to take advantage of it because it's an effective way of advertising his services.<p>

But he does provide the source, and he does encourage others to copy his ideas for their platforms, so it's not as though he is being selfish.<p>

It's not really effective as a test of a server's robustness. It is affected by backbones, peering arrangments, ISPs. So you could have a server which is up 99.9% of the time, but if there's a flakey connection between the server and you, it might look like it's up only 90% of the time.<p>

The only difficult part of that sort of service is coping with bounced e-mail.<p>

There are commercial services offering the same features, but they charge (presumably because of the admin headache caused by bouncing e-mail).
