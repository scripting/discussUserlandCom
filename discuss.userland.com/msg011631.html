The <a href="http://my.userland.com/">My.UserLand</a> aggregator is back on the air. Sorry for the outage. There was a bug in <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/xml/compile">xml.compile</a>. An assertion failure that was silent. Fixed. It's churning and interfacing again. <i>Murphy is good and kind!</i><p>

[[UserLand/Frontier/Samples]]New sample: <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$23">Simple String Remover</a>. "I needed this script because I wanted to markup the text on the Scripting News home page with categorization strings delimited by double square brackets."<p>

[[UserLand/Frontier/Samples]]<a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$31">Eric Soroos responds</a> with his version of my script which uses Regex. <i>Excellent!</i><p>

[[Computers/Clones/Dell]]ZDNN: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2344826,00.html">Dell Livid at Analyst Report</a>. "Dell Computer Corp. is livid with an influential computer analyst for issuing a critical report that faults the fast-growing computer maker for allegedly attempting to cover up a series of miscues."<p>

[[Computers/Apple/Macintosh]]Salon: <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/09/30/quicktime/index.html?CP=USE&DN=310">A worm in the Apple</a>? "Quicktime 4.0 is like nothing you've ever seen on a Mac. Has Apple broken its intuitive user interface?"<p>

[[Operating Systems/Linux]][[Operating Systems/Windows]]Linux.Com: <a href="http://www.linux.com/featured_articles/19990929/170/">Microsoft Fundamentalism vs Linux Spirituality</a>. "Microsoft has been and continues to fight for its survival with FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). It also uses power and control to force compliance. It is a top-down organization, struggling to control and monopolize the avenues of information transfer. Its top down model and insistence maintaining itself as the one and only way, is easily compared to fundamentalism. And what do fundamentalists stoop to when challenged by superior knowledge, technique or insight? You guessed it, FUD."<p>

One man's "spirituality" is another man's FUD. By focusing the spotlight on MS, they blow off independent developers and also the Mac, and Solaris, and basically everything else. Proof that not only are there self-centered jerks in big companies, but also self-centered jerks in the open source community.<p>
