It has some great introductory information as well as their new SVG plugin.<p>

I've been going through the demos this morning.  Very exciting.  If you're interested in web graphics and Flash you should check it out.<p>

Maybe I'll try to get in contact with the editor of svgnewbies.  He hasn't updated his ETP site in a while.  Maybe he could use some help.
