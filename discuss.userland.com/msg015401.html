Amazon.com has lots of minority shareholders, and their stock has been falling. In today's legal climate, there's a significant possibly that they will have to defend against minority shareholder lawsuits.<p>

Not defending their patents is probably a good way to lose these lawsuits. If the patents aren't defended, especially against direct competitors, it can be held as an example of management not excercising due diligence. <p>
