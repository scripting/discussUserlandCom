Yes, it's called withholding evidence and journalists are NOT protected, contrary to popular belief. However, as a matter of practice journalists are typically not pressed too strongly on this matter compared to other citizens because journalists <b>do</b> provide a service to this nation - both the citizens and the government alike, and need a bit of leeway for this to function. That's criminal behavior, however.<p>

Civil cases don't require disclosure of any kind. No harm to society...<p>

<i>I'm assuming here (reasonably I hope) that this came out because someone breached their NDA contract.</i><p>

Well, I honestly don't understand why Apple shut down Macintouch. I didn't see the content, but if it didn't involve copyrighted material, then it's pretty disturbing. AppleInsider I <b>totally</b> understand because the content there was copyrighted material. It wasn't theirs to disseminate. <p>

<i>Under current law, works are covered whether or not a copyright notice is attached and whether or not the work is registered.</i><p>

It doesn't much matter how or from whom the material was obtained, it's protected and Apple has the right to take their pound of flesh.<p>

If the Macintouch material was a release against NDA, then there's not much that can be done. If it was an Apple employee, or obtained by other means, then corporate espionage <i>might</i> be able to be argued. That's a much bigger issue, and Apple might be in the right, but it's clearly a stretch. They'd have to argue some measure of intent, I think.
