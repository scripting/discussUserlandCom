I was in a situation similar to you.  I installed LinuxPPC and it automatically boots into KDE and I didn't know what to do with it from that point.<p>

Since then, I have learned quite a bit (and I'm no UNIX guru)
I will tell you what I did, assuming it might help you:<p>

1) bought book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201895498/qid=912742832/sr=1-50/002-9636455-3900036">A Practical Guide to Linux</a> by Mark G. Sobell<p>

(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201895498/qid=912742832/sr=1-50/002-9636455-3900036">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201895498/qid=912742832/sr=1-50/002-9636455-3900036</a>)<p>

2) Check out Linux PPC <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/lppc-cache/1.html">Faq-o-matic</a><p>

(<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/lppc-cache/1.html">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/lppc-cache/1.html</a>)<p>

3) Inside a terminal window use the "man" command to call up manual pages.  For example, if you know a command, but you don't know what it does (like "ls") then try "man ls".  Of course, the man pages are notoriously cryptic...<p>

4) and here's the rest of what I did:<p>

I ditched KDE, which is really only one of several possible X window interfaces.  Now I'm using "afterstep" which is based loosely on NextSTEP.  To do this involved some reading of faqs and consequent editing of obscure text files which contain scripts / preferences.<p>

I set up "netatalk" so that I can mount my linux volumes on my mac over appletalk, and print to my ethernet networked printer (using a localtalk to ethernet bridge, actually) from the linux command line<p>

I believe that apache is on by default, serving web pages after you install linux.  Try connecting to the ip number of your LinuxPPC Mac by using a web browser on another machine (perhaps you can use Netscape on the same machine too) and you should see apache serving html pages which basically contain the documentation for apache.<p>

Hope this helps.  I am a total Unix/Linux novice, but I'm proud to have done quite a few things with my Linux box, and I can see enormous potential there.<p>

Good Luck.
