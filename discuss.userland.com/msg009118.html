I entered "programmer's journal" in <a href="http://search.userland.com/">http://search.userland.com/</a> and restricted it to the DG.<p>

I got the results I wanted, but one (and only one!) of the messages returned (coincidentally, the one I wanted) had the wrong date in the results listing.<p>

It's titled <b>Development Narratives</b> (message #8722) and was posted <b>7/24/99</b> but was listed in the search results as though it was posted on <b>12/22/98</b>.<p>
