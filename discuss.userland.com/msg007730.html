Instead of having the applet try to replace all parts of this page for example, why not just have it worry about the text editing.  In the same way, just have an applet work as an editor for the 'body' field in your web mail site.  A user can still enter the various info in text fields or check boxes but still have the editing ability.  <p>

With xml-rpc, an applet can 'save' the text to Frontier and still have a site utilize the discussionGroup framework.<p>
