(This works ok in whatever flavor of Navigator I have on my machine at present.)<p>

I will not guess why this isn't working correctly in Mac IE, but one possibility is the invalid html; anchors cannot be nested, and they are on this page.<p>

BTW, I like the addition to the site - it makes it much easier to point someone at the permanent link for a specific story - especially since these days more and more content is showing up per day.
