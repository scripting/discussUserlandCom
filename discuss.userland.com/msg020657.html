Even though I had logged in Frontier didn't know about it. Whenever I try to access the site now I get "This site can be accessed by Editors only." The email address I use is not recognised as being that of an Editor.<p>

Where in Froniter can I manually add my email address and password to the membership and also restore my privileges?<p>

Thanks,<p>
