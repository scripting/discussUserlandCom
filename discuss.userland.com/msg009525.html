The service packs for NT doesn't add new features (or aren't supposed to).  You could have gotten the 'new shell' by installing the full version of IE40, but we removed it from IE50 (I'm not sure why, but I imagine that it had something to do with the lawsuite).<p>

Anyway, you'll get the new shell with W2k.<p>
