Recently I've been keep all formatting options in directives. It makes it easy to use site-wide directives to maintain a consistent look, but also allows for customization per table or page. Sometimes it creates a little extra work in creating and editing several directives, but the easy sitewide consistency has made it well worth the effort for me.<p>

For navbar, though, I could imagine need to vary the formatting even within a single page, so I'm not sure this approach would be appropriate.
