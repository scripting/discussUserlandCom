The home web server market has a PC/Mac class machine connected (probably via a second phone line, maybe via DSL or ISDN or cable) 24x7 to the net, serving up a small website.  That machine IS used for the user's own browsing and emailing, but hopefully NOT for "office automation" tasks (word processing, spread sheets) - it's dedicated to the net. [if it is used for personal finances, the owner needs some tutoring in basic information security]  <p>

I read "Linux Don't Blink" to be speaking about that market; maybe I was wrong, but my reply is made within the context of that assumption.
[Ah... Here's the quote from Dave that gave me that idea: <i>"Come out with a low-priced version of NT Server that installs in 15 minutes, and comes up ready to blow dynamic pages out port 80"</i>]<p>

Dave's original sentence in "Linux Don't Blink" that I'm responding to said:
<pre>
    "If Microsoft won't give us the server platform we need, 
    it's sitting right here on Linux, ready to go, for a very
    reasonable price, without any lock-in. (None of the analysts 
    include that in their reasoning, how many dollars is the lack 
    of lock-in worth?)" 
</pre> <p>

If a home user can knock together a relatively bulletproof Linux & apache based web server for well under $1000, and rest assured that there will be ongoing support available because it's all open source, why would they use MS's NT/IIS, or a derivative tuned to the home market, that was NOT open source?<p>

My guess is that the valuation for RedHat's IPO will be based somewhat on the knowledge that people will flock to an open-source alternative so long as it's stable and has the same basic features of its non-open-source competition.<p>

Hosting a home-based web server on an NT/IIS platform's not stupid, but it's just not cost effective, in the short run OR in the long run.<p>

I applaud that Userland's tools work across various platforms; that's keeping you in business.  But which OS and web server a user hosts their home web pages from really is an "either/or" proposition; they're going to choose one and stay with it for quite a while.<p>

Dave scratches at the surface of what I'm trying to get across right in the parenthesis in the above quote; There's a TREMENDOUS value to the end-user in "lack of lock in"; If I could, I'd reword his paragraph to read:<p>

<pre>
   "We have, sitting here in front of us, Linux.  It's ready to go,
   for a very reasonable price, and without any lock-in.  MS is going
   to have to do an insanely great job to succeed in competing with
   it; if their competition remains closed source, it will have to
   out-perform, out-feature, and out-class Linux just to outweigh the
   burden that closed source technology places on its customers." 
</pre><p>

I choose Linux; it only reboots when I want it to.  I've had trouble finding something to build as a contribution back to the Linux community, since every app I've thought of building for it (so far) has already been built!<p>
