There is no provision for steady-state in the above, which is in fact what we do observe in most populations. That is, at some point, resources will constrain growth. Right now, the rate of population growth is slowing. In about 40 years it is projected that we will achieve a steady-state point, where the birth rate matches the death rate and the population remains relatively constant. <p>

It does affect my argument in that at some point the argument for new users will fully balance that for old users as the population will be equal. We'll probably have to resort to ethics or theology or economics or some such thing to help break the tie.
