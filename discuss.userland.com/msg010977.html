While channel exclusion is nice, I want to be able to do things the other way around.  I want to by default exclude all channels except those that I have specifically designated.  Any new channels will be excluded by default.<p>

The problem I have is that all kinds of find but uninteresting (to me) channels keep being added and almost every day I have to go and exclude them.  After doing exactly the same thing four days in a row I am quite sure that this is something that can be improved.<p>

*A view that shows me new items not grouped by hour but since I last checked.  In other words, show me what's new to me.<p>

*A special "new channels" channel.
A new channels channel would let me browse from time to time to see what new channels I might want to include.<p>

Just for kicks I may end up doing these client side in IE 5 but I'd prefer to have it happen on the server.<p>
