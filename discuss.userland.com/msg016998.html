I find that often CNN does not do adequate research before going live with the information. In this latest example, they seem to imply that <b>every</b> computer user is affected. Why can't they say only Windows users were affected? Those of us using Mac's are unfazed by this Microsoft OS fiasco; same for Be's users.  CNN should use its position to be a lot more informative instead of being an <b>alarmist</b> news media unaware of the larger picture in the computing world.<p>
