cool from what I've seen.</i><p>

I have a confession to make: playing with XML RPC
made me realize that I had recently forgotten
something very very important:<p>

Time is too precious to think "<i>hey, that format
cannot handle object instances and recursive data
structures and this and that, and I can sure
invent something better myself</i>" and then
spend weeks arguing about whether we really
need this or that feature...<p>

Better grab something that's out there and put
it to work in a <i>real</i> application.<p>

Who knows?  It might be a perfect solution to
your problem!<p>

...<p>

(And yes, we also just changed from a homegrown RPC mechanism
to XML-RPC in several internal applications.  Like our labweb
server, which now runs what is essentially WebDAV over XML-RPC.
Took less time to write the code than to read the WebDAV spec.
And my head didn't explode this time ;-)
