One thing, though: Stallman, and his followers, and the FSF, don't care if you make ends meet. They want your code, and believe that you are inherently evil if you dare to suggest that you should be allowed to get more for writing it than a day laborer.
<P>
I agree that truly free open source is a gift. But GPLed code is a Trojan horse -- a gift with destruction hidden inside. The press doesn't understand this; naive reporters, working on deadline, take the FSF's misleading rhetoric at face value and are not sophisticated enough to recognize that there are warriors inside the horse. Even <A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/eweek/stories/general/0,11011,2618362,00.html">eWeek</A>, in an oddly un-bylined editorial, seems to have swallowed the GPL bait without recognizing the hook that's waiting inside for IT managers and programmers.
<P>
Truly free open source is a good thing -- a gift given with good intentions. The BSD TCP/IP stack was the gift that birthed the Internet, and BIND and Sendmail made it useful.
<P>
But GPLed software has a poison pill hidden inside, and companies such as Corel are greedily eating it up and beginning to feel the effects of the poison.
<P>
We've got to stop this.
