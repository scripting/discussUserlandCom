I had made some updates to my channel (Privacy Digest) at <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1281">http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1281</a> at approx 4AM (Eastern) and did not see any of the updates in the my.userland.com daily/hourly scans. (I went back to the start of the day), but when I made additional updates the new additions showed up correctly. <p>

BTW the data had been scanned. I went to <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1281">http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1281</a> and saw the content and time of the scan (2:58AM Pacific). All entries in this weblog have processed fine since the hiccup.<p>
