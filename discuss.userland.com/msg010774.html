No no no no.  That's *not* the problem!<p>

"All nines" is 99/99/99, which is not September 9th.  That convention will work fine.<p>

The *problem* is in program with data entry screens that *insist* that the operator enters a date for something, but the operator doesn't have the required information for some reason.<p>

A reasonable program will allow you to enter null values.  An unreasonable one will insist on a value.<p>

What's the poor data entry operator to do?  Make something up!  99/99/99 would be good, but maybe the program checks that what you type is a valid date and makes you do it again if it's not.  So they enter 9/9/99.  It doesn't matter what it is, as long as the data entry operator can recognise it later as meaning "no date" or "invalid date" or whatever.<p>

The program -- and the programmer -- never know a thing about this.  It's purely a data entry operator convention.<p>


It's now 10:40 on 9/9/99 here in NZ and all *my* stuff is working fine :-)<p>
