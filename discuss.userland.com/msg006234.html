WINE requires an i386 architecture CPU in your 
system, no matter what OS you're running it under.<p>


From <<a href="http://www.winehq.com/source/documentation/how-to-port">http://www.winehq.com/source/documentation/how-to-port</a>><p>

   This document does not say a thing about how to port Wine to 
   non-386 operating systems, though.  You would need a CPU emulator.
   Let's get Wine into a better shape on 386 first, OK?<p>

So porting Frontier to WINE != porting Frontier to Linux.
