I was hanging around Ann's house and I thought I was logged in when I posted this message.
To my suprise it showed that it was Ann who posted this Adobe parody thingi.
She is disappoited that it was not her. She would have wanted to be the one credited with this sarcastic prose. But to no avail. Sorry it was me.... marekj. <p>

To Adobe:
If you want to sue Ann for posting this message about your stupid suit please be advised that it was me. Marek J who really  posted it. You are welcome to sue my ass for making this joke on you. You may remove ann's panties first (after all her panties are made by Adobe... Wow, you adobe guys make really colorful seams and thread in her panties.) then you can sue me.
Ohhh..... I am so afraid. Well. you know I have been trained. I grew up in communism. I had a lot of training in being so scared shitless of this big brother thing. Good luck to you in protecting this stupid patent. I wish you all the best in basking yourself in your self adorment of you tabbed dialog boxes. Isaac Newton, if he was alive, would gladly sue you for patent infringment since you are using his ideas in your software. Thanks , Have a nice day and don't let high quality graphic hit you in your ass on your way out of this website. 
Thanks your patronage. We are looking forward to see what other sensless patents you come up with. We'll be so scared..... It will seem like every day is Halloween. We thank you for that thrill cause we did not have halloween in Poland.
Ride on Baby.
