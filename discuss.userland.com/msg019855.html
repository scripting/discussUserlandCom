Linus is a hard worker, but I would always say he was a "student" of Tanenbaum.  We all do what we do standing on the shoulders of giants, and it's really not fair to say that Linus was much taller than Tanenbaum when he was standing so squarely upon those shoulders that made his point of view possible.
