<blockquote><i>When one of these sites becomes popular, the publisher begins to devote 80 hours a week of free labor to moderating discussions, weeding out redundant classified ads, deleting alerts for users whose e-mail addresses have evaporated, answering questions from the confused, keeping content up-to-date, developing new content in response to user questions, etc. The beautiful thing about this is that so many people are willing to devote 80 unpaid hours a week toward helping their fellow human being. The ugly thing about this is that 80 hours a week turns out not to be enough.</i></blockquote><p>
