I've been thinking about it for several days.<p>

Chinese citizens and American citizens regard each other with suspicion and distrust.  How do we change this?<p>

A lot of ignorance and distrust goes away when you know someone and talk to them and interact with them on a daily, personal basis.  You build trust and regard.  You learn their culture and their experiences and learn to see things they way they do.<p>

I'd like to see more programs where Americans travel to China and Chinese travel to the US.  Sure, there is a lot happening now, but we need more.  A variation I'd like to see: Chinese government officials living with average American families and vice versa.  Anything for all of us to get real views and real understanding of each other and get beyond diplomatic posturing.<p>

I'd really like to hear more ideas about how we can use (or how people are using) the Internet to promote mutual understanding through interaction.
