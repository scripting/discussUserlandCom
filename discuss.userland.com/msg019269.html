I called technical support.  Waited on hold for 3 hours and got cut off.  Called sales and they put me right through to Tech Sup.   They ran me down a list of things to try, still nothing, they gave me a new number to call to check on the status of my "Ticket"  <p>

The next day I picked up the phone to call to check and my other line rang, it was Qwest (It's saturday 8:00 AM)  They had me check some things at my TNI  (telephone network interface the box on the wall of my house)  Still no luck...<p>

9:00 PM saturday another call, setting up a time to come out Sunday,  they showed up on time (I was amazed too)  The guy spent 3 hours on a Sunday morning (100+ degrees out) up on the pole trying to find a line that wasn't "coiled".  Now I am running and loving it.<p>

They earned me back, I am happy with Qwest so far (we used to be US Worst too)<p>
