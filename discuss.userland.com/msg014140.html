It's possible that Apple isn't prioritizing DHTML for the same reason.<p>

What got everyone all excited about Java back in the late 1900's (it's fun to be able to write that!) was that it offered a chance to provide more interactivity than HTML, and to provide it on a variety of platforms.  (Delivery of the promise is another thing.)<p>

I think most reasonable people would agree that, while you can build a nice page with HTML, you can do much better with DHTML, and better still with a native application -- Dave has complained about using the Web as an email environment for exactly this reason.  A native application can push pixels better than any cross-platform abstraction, so it always feels better.<p>

So, it depends on the race of network effects -- will the network effects of cool DHTML applications win out over the competing native applications?<p>

(Apple's definitely going for an evil lock-in, though, and it's a shame!)
