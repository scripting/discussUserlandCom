I'm not going to suggest one ISP or another, because no ISP can guarantee high uptime in the face of a single point of failure.<p>

Have you considered becoming multi-homed? You could keep the T1 through PacBell/Conxion, and get another one from someone else. Then when one goes down, traffic can still flow through the other. And as trafffic to the million Manila sites starts to soar, you'd have twice the bandwidth.
