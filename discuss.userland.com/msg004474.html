Anyone who saw my Chinese DG screenshot, please help me. I was trying to tie the Chinese Search Engine and the Chinese DG, but I went thru every single script in mainresponder.discuss and still couldn't find where the DG messages are indexed. Can anyone point me to the right direction? Also, can I overrider the indexing script w/o patching the built-in script?
