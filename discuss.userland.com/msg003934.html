My problem: I need a person to enter information into a Frontier table, so I've built a browser-based front end to make it easy.  I'm using inetd/cgi to capture the info.  One element of this is some html that references existing gif files. I'd like to display the html/gifs in a new window but I can't figure out where to put the gifs in the file system that would correspond to the inetd root. (There are a lot of gifs and I don't want to import them into Frontier if I don't have to.)<p>

Long story short: html exists in Frontier table. It references a folder full of gifs in the file system.  I can display the html, but the gifs are broken because I don't know how/where to reference them.<p>

The Using Inetd page infers that inetd only serves stuff up through the Frontier database. Does this mean the images MUST be imported into Frontier? Or am I reading this incorrectly? Hope this makes sense. Apologies if this is the wrong venue for this question.  TIA<p>

Using 5.0.2b20 Mac.<p>
