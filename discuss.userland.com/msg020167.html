I looked around the net and didn't find what I needed. So I created the code, using the stuff I found as a starting point. I tested it to be sure it interoperated with previous implementations. <br><br>	Then I <a href="http://www.scripting.com/midas/base64/source.html">released</a> the source code. No license agreement. Also no restrictions on what anyone could do with it. Now here's the question.

This apparently small feature has the potential to route around centralized Web directories such as Yahoo and DMOZ. <br><br>	It does this by <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/decentralization/293">decentralizing</a>, giving the power to create and join directories to the people of the Internet. <br><br>	Now the big question is, do they want this power?
