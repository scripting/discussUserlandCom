Did anyone see the Reuters headline late last week about the British military communications satellite that was taken over by hackers? Apparently, they held it hostage, changed its orbit, and threatened to deplete all of its fuel if they weren't paid.<p>

This story was on the wires for about 6 hours, then it disappeared. The story mentioned that the British gov't was declining comment and trying to keep the issue quiet. Whether it was a hoax or someone succeeded in keeping the story quiet, I don't know. <p>

Has anyone heard any additional news on is subject?
