You should be able to use it without knowing the syntax of any particular file format. (You'd still have to understand the concepts behind DNS, of course.) Therefore, it would work in terms of zones and RRs instead of characters and lines.<p>

It should never save a syntactically incorrect zone file.<p>

It should be able to spot common mistakes like Eric's.<p>

It should preserve comments. :-)<p>

What kind of interface it uses (GUI, HTML, XML-RPC, etc.) isn't really important IMO, as long as it's discoverable. (That's the most important thing: Good tools are discoverable; text files usually aren't.)
