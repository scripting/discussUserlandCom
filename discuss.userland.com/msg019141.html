Thanks a lot for the feedback Paul, unfortunately I'm still stuck with "people using Java seem pretty happy with it, and it’s definitely hip, on the other hand a lack of high-profile applications isn't particularly reassuring".<p>

It really bothers me that companies such as, say, UserLand, who appear to have an open, multi-platform development approach that would in theory benefit massively from Java don't seem to be considering it at all.<p>

Guess I'll have to spend more time looking at it to form my own opinion. Drat.<p>

Which are the languages you prefer over Java?
