It's not really an xserver, more of a free cross platform timbuktu type of thing. The vnc server runs on the machine that you want to control, and the client runs on your desktop machine. (Reversing the X server  client-server roles). I've found that Xterms are much better than the windows telnet client, once you figure out how to scroll. <p>

I haven't figured out how to make it use anything other than twm, which is a boring tiny window manager, but for a 486 acting as a server, I don't need much more.<p>
