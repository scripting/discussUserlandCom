I'd like a channel that contains links (perhaps even URLS via wsf) and text (how far a project is, what are the trouble spots, where are the latest reports, when is the next project meeting, etc).  I'm not sure what else I would do but I'm sure it would evolve.  <p>

Next, I'd like to try a channel that displays result from scientific instrumentation...a remote status display.  <p>

The channel should be accessible through a browser hopefully served by frontier (like those on my.userland.com).
