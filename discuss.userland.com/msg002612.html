On 01.06 I went book hunting on the net.  First I check in with Amazon, which said the book was no in stock but would be shipped within 2 weeks.  Then I went barnesannobles, and the book was "in stock"!.<p>

Great.  So I order the book.  Next day I get an email from barnesandnobles saying thank you for your order, we currently DON'T have your book in stock, but it will be shipped within 2 weeks, to which I replied (and cc'd amazon.com to make a point in commerce):<p>

Dear barnesandnoble.com<p>

I must say that as a first time customer I am VERY disappointed.  What is one to think?  That your website information is not to be _trusted_?<p>

The ONLY reason I placed this order w/ you & not amazon.com is because
amazon.com had _clearly_ (honestly?) indicated that this book would be
shipped in 1-2 weeks; you however had _clearly_ indicated 1-2 DAYS.  In making this decision (based on the availability of the product) I also had to forgo the added services offered (at the same price as yours) offered by amazon.com.<p>

Looks like I made the wrong choice here.<p>

FYI:<p>

IF you KNOW that an item is available for shipping, _that_ is the
information you should post in your site;  if it is not, then DON'T SAY SO.
IF you must "anticipate", then prey, <I>use the technology at hand</i> and do a DB Lookup on your inventory when you serve webpages which I am sure are dynamically generated.  If they are not, then get on with the program!<p>

In short, try to be <I>accurate</I> and <I>factual</I>.  Anticipation & guesswork is <I>NOT</I> what I am looking for in an eCommerce outlet:  i.e. TIMELY and FACTUAL information regarding the services offered.

On 1.28 (!) [that's 22 days later folks] I get another email from 'service' at barnesandnobles.com saying that the book is on "back order".<p>

At which point I canceled the order.<p>

(p.s. this is not an endorsement of amazon.com's service as I have not yet used their service)<p>

(p.s.s. The book, 'Primates : The Amazing World of Lemurs, Monkeys and Apes', is STILL marked as in stock, as of today!)
