There's the problem, anyone whose posts are deemed objectionable is going to make a lot of trouble for the people who are still there.<p>

I think I want to start a magazine, with a small group of friends, and see what happens. It's not intended to be democratic or open, just something fun for some people, not all people.<p>

See there's no opportunity for punishment in that model. Hey, I'm allowed to go out to dinner with my friends, or go bowling with them, why can't I have a website with them? Rhetorical question, of course I can.
