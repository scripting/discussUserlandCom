<p>    So I think the important thing here is that Userland provides us with a good framework, where base logic is well separated from implementation, and implementation is well separated from design. This will allow us to try out our own favourite interfaces.
<p>	As far as I can tell the separation is good in Nirvana - but there is still work to be done in this aspect. More dokumentation would help a lot, hopefully this will come with the release.
