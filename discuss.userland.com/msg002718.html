I found this in the RPC Debugger page:
   The XML text is sent to a script running on betty.userland.com. It
   sends the call to the server indicated here:
   Server:nirvana.userland.com     Port:80   
   Ken MacLeod is running a Perl server at biff.bitsko.slc.ut.us, port
   8000. 4/14/98.<p>

1. Anybody knows which language is used to develop the server on nirvana.userland.com? Is it also perl?
2. Can I use c++ or Java to develop the server instead of perl? How can I call them through a xml message without using CGI. (this is my major concern). To make a more clear, for example: <p>

I have a XML message which contains remote procedure name and parameters, after a XML parser on the server side, we get the name and parameters. Suppose the procedure is implemented by C++ or Java on server side, how can I call this procedure from the point after the XML parser(where procedure name and parameters are already available)? (CGI is not allowed to use)
Help please!!!<p>

3. Anybody have some idea to use XML with CORBA/IIOP, anybody see some advantage of this method?<p>

Thanks a lot.
