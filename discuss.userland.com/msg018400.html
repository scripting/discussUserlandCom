  my first post... thanks in advance for reading...  the following is my vision... something similar to this already exists in the form of epinions.com , photo.net etc but not exactly - please advise<p>

<b>Background</b> - A <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$17729">vision</a> has hit me.<p>

I have learnt a lot about the web ( esp. life,living, etc ) in the last 3 years from:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.photo.net">photo.net</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.useit.com">useit.com</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.scripting.com">scripting.com</a>
</ul>
to mention the top three of my mind this moment. And I think that most of everything else worthwhile I already know ( need to know ) in this lifetime is linked from these sites :-)<p>

<a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$37">Joel</a> states <i>I suspect that if you read all the books that I've read, you will come not only to understand me, but you'll start to think like me, too.</i><p>

How true! I am trying to think like Phil, Jakob, Dave and others who inspire me with their contributions on the web.....<p>

<b>Vision / Idea</b> I have been looking at yahoo.com, webring.org, epinions.com , amazon.com , google.com too... Why are they successful ??? Why does everyone like these sites more than others ??? It is probably ONLY because of the brilliant minds of the people who manage these sites... and the features available<p>

Please see <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/books/building-community/">Building an Online <i>Purposeful</i> Community</a><p>

My vision is to learn from and contribute to an online community that allows ALL human beings to participate ( something similar to epinions.com... but the key object is people )<p>

<b>Fundamental point</b> : Please see <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/hotList">http://www.weblogs.com/hotList</a> (The 100 sites most-linked-to by the Weblogs)<p>

I am thinking of a similar "hotpeople" list or a wwwOfRealPeople.net ( along the lines of photo.net )<p>

Key Features
<ul>
  <li>list of people: name, email, personal website, interests
  <li>everyone should be able maintain a list of "peers" and assign "my best" , "recently met" and comment... on them briefly on "why they like them" etc<p>

  <li>( i can list the other features if you are interested)
</ul><p>

Output
<ul>
  <li>currently, it has been sheer luck that i have come across Phil Greenspun, Jakob Nielsen, Dave Winer on the web -> But with the availability of this community... it will be easy for us to educate people... anyone ( kid, student, employee, employer ) can learn from the best minds in the world based on his interests
  <li>we can easily come out with a list "10/100/1000 most influential people" on the web, on photography, designers etc
  <li>...
</ul><p>

I have been thinking about this idea for some time now... and it is better now than later...<p>

Do you like these ideas ?<p>

It would be great if someone ( or many ) can help me realise this vision<p>

Once again, Thanks for reading, Kishore.<p>

ps: I maintain a "hotpeople" list at <a href="http://kishore.editthispage.com/people">http://kishore.editthispage.com/people</a> - I am just trying to think of the best way to maintain all our lists<p>

"let's make things better"
