I'm not so sure. The key points that BizTalk is founded on are:<p>

1) People/businesses are much more likely to come up with different XML schemas to represent their data that settle on a single one, especially since most would prefer a simple high-level, narrow-domain schema that's easy to use and relevant to their task rather that a low-level, wide-domain schema that can be used for any data representation but looks complicated, especially since wide-domain schemas don't, most of the time, make translation and extraction easier but just push it further up the schema ladder.<p>

2) Since 1) means it's unlikely that people are going to settle on a single complete data schema to use, it's probably better to come up with a system that accepts that, and gives people a way to a) access and publish the many available schemas and b) encourage ways to translate between those schemas.<p>

3) XML developers want to deal with relevant data, not with transport or parsing.<p>

While I think that the wrapper schema that BizTalk represents may, to a small degree, contradict point 1), I think it's a worthwhile tradeoff for point 3).<p>

I also think that you shouldn't worry about BizTalk being a direct competitor to XML-RPC (at least, not as a spec or service - product lines are something else). If query-reponse is implemented in Biztalk (and looking even deeper into the docs they talk about something similar) then XML-RPC could be able sit on top of BizTalk quite happily, and BizTalk components could theoretically make XML-RPC more popular (since it could take away the burden of transport implementation from those needing to create XML-RPC services on a platform).<p>

My main problem with BizTalk is not the idea but that it's meant to be an open standards body that acts as a hub for collection and publication of many different schemas from many different businesses - and we're meant to trust Microsoft with running it. Microsoft has talked in the past (most notably in the Halloween docs) about commoditisation of protocols - would you put your protocol in Microsoft's hands?<p>
