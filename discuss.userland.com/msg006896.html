I want to build a table in local storage within a script, and then copy it to the clipboard as a table, so I can later paste it into another table. The reason I'm doing this is that I can't be sure which of a dozen tables I'll be pasting it into (otherwise I'd just build it right in the destination).<p>

I do this with the following snippet:
<pre>
local(tempTable)
new(tableType, @tempTable)
new(stringType, @tempTable.text)
new(dateType, @tempTable.date)
tempTable.text = "test"
tempTable.date = clock.now()
clipboard.putvalue(tempTable)
</pre><p>

The problem is that when I paste, I get an item named "pasted binary" that's a binary object (of kind binary[tabl]). I can manually convert this to a table, but it seems as if there ought to be a way for this to happen automagically.<p>

I'm using Frontier 5.0.2b19. Anyone have any suggestions? Ideally I would be able to set the name of the item as well as making making it paste as a table.<p>
