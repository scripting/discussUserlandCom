Check out <a href=http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/index.html>WinVNC</a>.<p>

Or check out VNC for Linux, Solaris, Macintosh, Windows CE, etc, etc. All at the same link.<p>

This does the exact same thing as desktop.com, does it today, is multiplatform, and runs in any browser that supports Java through a microscopic java app.  One client for all platforms.<p>

A Linux system admin w/ some skill could replicate Desktop.com in, I don't know, less than a week, using VNC.  He'd probably have to license it, but it would cost less than reinventing X windows in ActiveX...<p>

I have this functionality today, except I run the server, and can access it from any machine I'm likely to encounter.<p>

VNC comes from the Oracle/Olivetti Research Lab, now owned by AT&T, and seems to be the software core for the network computer we never saw.<p>

Oh, and VNC is open source...
