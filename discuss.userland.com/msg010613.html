Midnight rolled on by and I didn't notice a memory drop.  A few minutes later, I noticed that the 30 megs had been consumed!  Whoa!  So I started to dig!  I checked the daily log and noticed that I had an errant call to the SE (search engine) indexer.  I'd left the call in the everyMinute scheduler the last time I was tinkering with the SE.<p>

We'll see if this takes care of the memory usage situation.  I'll keep you posted.
