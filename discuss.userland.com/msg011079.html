If they somehow forced it on the users' screen, that'd be one thing. But those using Junkbusters and Third Voice do so by choice (they downloaded and installed the software). I understand where it could be frustrating for a web designer (I know), but it's not my say how a collective userbase decides to view my content as long as they don't trick eachother into thinking I intended it that way.
