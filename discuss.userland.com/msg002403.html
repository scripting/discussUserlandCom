The problem is you might not know, if you're a casual infrequent user, why the software is displaying the messages for March 12, when it's now July 31. I agree that a frequent user (like myself) would figure it out quickly and appreciate what it's doing. It's the newbies I don't want to confuse.<p>

I know a lot of people step thru messages by clicking on Next/Prev, but I'm not sure how to get them to the first-message-they-haven't-read with just one click.<p>
