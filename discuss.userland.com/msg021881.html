OK, so how does Wednesday sound for a Scripting News dinner in NY? Some place with a TV set and lots of room and good food. We're going to get loud. I think <a href="http://adamcurry.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$27">Adam Curry</a> will be joining us from Amsterdam. Where should we have it? I need some help here. I'll be staying in Manhattan, of course.<br><br>

Hey on the <a href="http://www.groove.net/">Groove site</a> they're saying the announce date is on Tuesday. Excellent. I'm going to be at their launch event. <br><br>

Thanks to the NetDyslexia guys for doing a <a href="http://fast.weblogs.com/">version</a> of Weblogs.Com that works well with Netscape 4. <br><br>
O'Reilly's P2P <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/q/p2p_category">directory</a> is a fair start. Not sure if things break down that way. I cringe at the description of Radio UserLand, it's so much more, but it's our fault, the website hasn't kept pace with the software. I was glad to see Manila included in the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/t/84">Writeable Web</a> category. <br><br>
On the <a href="http://www.xml.org/xml-dev/index.shtml">XML-DEV list</a> we're talking about practical startup projects for the Semantic Web. It's a good way to get to the core of what people think it is, to remove the abstractions, and look for a way to demo it. Perhaps the project that O'Reilly has started would work better as a Semantic Web directed graph, because just in the things I know, I see the taxonomy they've chosen falling down. Shouldn't Jabber and BXXP be in the same class as XML-RPC and SOAP? I think they're on a continuum. And shouldn't <a href="http://www.ebxml.org/">ebXML</a> be there too? <a href="http://www.icestandard.org/">ICE</a>? The more I think about this the more I think it's about organizing all the current projects on the net that are trying to do something new. And I don't see an obvious place to put <a href="http://www.groove.net/">Groove</a>. (I'm such a tease.)<br><br>

Today's song: <a href="http://www.steelydan.com/nightflyrics.html#GOODBYE">The Goodbye Look</a>. "The surf was easy on the day I came to stay on this quiet island in the bay. I remember a line of women all in white, the laughter and the steel bands at night."<br><br>
Looks like <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$microsoft.com">someone hijacked</a> Microsoft.Com? Wes says no. Someone registered a long sentence-like domain name that begins with microsoft.com. I'm confused. Not a big surprise. Happens a lot when you get to be my age.<br><br>
