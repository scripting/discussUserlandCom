With open-source on the upswing and everybody and their uncle putting up web pages, to name a couple of key trends, more and more people are becoming potential users of such a system.  A truly elegant solution could be one of those "killer apps" you hear about...<p>

In that context, it's important for the system to be as automated as possible.  The two categories of automation available from a Frontier solution that come to mind are search engines and discussion groups. However, for this application, I don't think either are perfect.  <p>

Search engines are good for some people, some of the time.  If you know what you're after, and that's all you want, then there's nothing else you'd want instead.  *But* if you don't know exactly what you want; well, it's hard to browse through a search engine interface.  You have no idea how much content is behind it, or what the structure(s) might be.<p>

Discussion groups allow great commenting, and you can follow threads.  However, the structure is organic, the information grows in a non-structured way.<p>

What *I'd* like from a samples/utilities resource is search capabilities *and* a well designed and highly maintained user interface structure.  Now, I know that that second option has traditionally cost a lot, people- and time-wise.  But what if there were a way to design, extend and contribute to a site collaboratively?  Set up the initial design, perhaps, but then allow the navigation and structure to be modified by contributers somehow.  How?  I don't know - perhaps changes would have to go through a small number of "editors"; or open up all changes in a safe "upload-area" similar to what BBSs do, until they're approved.  Changes could be logged for easy review.  It would be a community resource, organized and maintained by the community, but governed by a "benevolent dictator(s)".  <p>

I don't know much about Frontier beyond static publishing and some CGI-style programming, but from what I've gathered from Scripting News and the mail lists, this would be do-able.  <p>
