What a great story and takes me back to my first job in the computer industry.<p>

In August 1982, I was hired as the Customer Support Manager for Omega MicroWare, Inc., publishers of LockSmith and other Apple II disk utilities.<p>

LockSmith was the premier copy program of the day for Apple II's. It had ways to nibble-copy disks, edit specific headers and trailers of sectors, and manipulate parameters to overcome almost any copy-protection scheme. Omega MicroWare sold tens of thousands of copies of LockSmith in the early 1980's.<p>

In fact, Visicalc was the number one program that users bought LockSmith to copy. In those years gone by, many software publishers would not provide a backup or replacement copy of software if the disk became unreadable. Because the Copyright law allowed a user to create a backup copy of software for their own use, Omega MicroWare had a fantastic market niche. <p>

However, we followed a policy and would not publish LockSmith program parameters for publishers that provided a free backup disk or replacement policy for registered users. Many CEO's called me to complain about LockSmith parameters until I told them about that policy. Some changed their tunes afterwards and some continued to complain. The telephone 'hold' button was a marvelous tool in such cases. :-)<p>

Omega MicroWare published pages of program parameters for our users that covered every game and major Apple II program at that time. The copy-protection wars were fought with customers caught in the middle. Eventually, copy-protection stopped being done and it was a good thing. Far too many users were having trouble running non-standard DOS used by copy-protection schemes.<p>

Omega MicroWare wasn't the only game in town. I remember working the 1982 AppleFest in San Francisco and meeting a guy who had a hardware solution to copy-protection. He had created a Apple II board that allowed a copy-protected disk to be loaded into memory and then he had a button attached to a cable that  issued a non-maskable interrupt to grab all memory allowing boot-traces and disassembly to take place. One could then write out modified memory to a disk effectively removing the copy-protection.<p>

Those were the days. :-)<p>
