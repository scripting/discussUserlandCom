The person of the millenium should be someone from the beginning of millenium, someone whose contribution was felt thru the entire period. That would set an optimistic tone for the young people at the beginning of the next one, which is coming soon!<p>

I also think there need to be categories. And that the number one person should be someone who we feel made a *positive* contribution, and leave space for the most influential person who made a negative one.<p>
