I'm not so sure about this. It <i>is</i> difficult to get your site listed as 'cool' or featured at the top of a category, but it seems to me that all that's required to get a simple listing is to submit a link and a description via CGI. The last time I personally did this was before Yahoo did their re-org and added all the chat features (about a year ago), but I didn't have to do anything special to get a listing at that time, and others I know have had similar experiences.
