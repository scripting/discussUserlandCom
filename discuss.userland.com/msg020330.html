You could certainly lose the power to steer the ship.

Frankly, I see no benefit to you if you make your code freely available under <i>any</i> license. You're not hurting for development resources; you wouldn't be using it to promote something else for which you <i>could</i> get paid; there isn't a whole lot that people could do with it if it were open source that isn't already being done with it. You might want to open up the technical workings more, and/or step up efforts to provide a free SDK and/or free hosting. But giving away the farm would not benefit you, IMHO.
