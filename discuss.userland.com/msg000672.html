I agree that Martin Luther deserves consideration. But my personal choice for Person of the Millennium? Sir Isaac Newton.<p>

Newton contributed to *so many* fields of inquiry, from mathematics to mechanical physics to optics to astronomy; one has to go all the way back to Aristotle to find another scientist/naturalist of similar breadth, vision, and influence. (Galileo might have come close if not for his inquiries being cut short by the Church.)
