I see 36 reads of the original DG message, of which 17 ended up clicking through to my site. Additionally one person came through using the news.userland.com/discuss interface.<p>

I see 143 reads of the report itself, and about 800 extra hits on my site as a today. About 300 of those are the one link (text + 1 image), the rest are people poking around for a while.<p>

Of those, perhaps 5% are AvantGo users.   This surprised me, but on reflection, the SN home page is syndicated to AvantGo format, so it's not too surprising. Scalable content is good.<p>

The conclusions? Write something interesting and get it on this microportal/weblog/whatever this is, and you will get some traffic.<p>
