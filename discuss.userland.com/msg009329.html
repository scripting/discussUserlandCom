I suppose it should be no surprise, but you'd think with 3 billion bucks to spend on development and testing their systems stand up on their own. I think it speaks powerfully that MS doesn't think their products CAN make it on their own, without FUDding the competition.<p>

The very reason that Linux works so well is that you have so many people (read: in so many environments) testing and developing the OS.<p>
