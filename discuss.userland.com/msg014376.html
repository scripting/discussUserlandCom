as you are looking for a place to do a live session in Europe - I propose that you come to Karlsruhe, to the "Zentrum f&uuml;r Kunst und Medientechnologie" (Center for Arts and Media). Which is perhaps THE Frontier place in Germany (apart from Andr&eacute; Radkes desktop, perhaps).<p>

What do you have here? For your presentation: The "Media Theater" which is an auditorium for about 200 people with state-of-the-art stage technology and live streaming capabilities (both RealAudio and Quicktime) for audio and video. Next door, we have the "Hochschule f&uuml;r Gestaltung" which is a university for media arts, philosophy, art's history. There's Deutsche Telekom and several other telecommunications companies in town, another art's school, an engineering university. You could have a very interesting audience - artists, business people, designers, programmers - both live and on the internet. (BTW, Karlsruhe is in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland, Frankfurt is only an hour's ride away.)<p>

Currently, we are re-designing the website around a set of SQL and Filemaker databases, completely with Frontier and Manila. We have several avid Frontier developers (two Support Associates: Tom F&uuml;rstner, formerly at ORF Online; Christoph Pingel, formerly at Digitale Informationssysteme - remember "Brockhaus" and "Radio Regenbogen" and some articles in c't? -; and some very talented newbies), perhaps the biggest Frontier developers pool in Europe, and we are growing. <p>

About the institute: ZKM is - as far as I know - the only "physical" institution in the World that is dedicated *entirely* to New Media and the Arts; you will hardly find anyone in the international media art's community who has not yet been here. The current exhibition here called "net_condition" (which is featured under <a href="http://www.zkm.de">http://www.zkm.de</a>) is perhaps the first "real" exhibition about net.art and similar fields.<p>

We think that you, as a pioneer of Macintosh and Windows programming, outlining, web logging, scripting, have to contribute something very essential in this setting, preferably as an official part of net_condition. This will definitely be a win-win situation, and we will do everything to make it a successful event for you.<p>

So please allow us to kindly invite you to come to Karlsruhe in February!<p>

Best regards,
Tom F&uuml;rstner and Christoph Pingel
