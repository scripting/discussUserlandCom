Is Dan Quayle smart? Of course he is. Brilliant--quite possibly not, but anyway, the connection between extremely high intelligence and superb general leadership is dubious, to say the least.<p>

If most people thought about it, I believe they would conclude that, if they spent many/most of their waking hours in the public eye (i.e., the reportorial cross-hairs), they too would furnish adequate "evidence" that they fall somewhere on the idiocy scale between "bumbling fool" and "total moron".<p>
