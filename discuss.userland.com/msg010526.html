Nice! That's a really clever, lightweight way to get a newsfeed.<p>

Our affiliate software is designed for people who want multiple channels and a (large) local database of news. It's based on Zope and XML-RPC. I spent this morning optimizing Zope XML-RPC so we can move large batches of news in just a few seconds.<p>

We're trying to make everything simple and customizable. I'll start posting information to <a href="http://linux.userland.com/">http://linux.userland.com/</a> if anyone would like to follow our work.<p>

Cheers,<br>
