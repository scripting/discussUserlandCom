Reading the piece, I want to thank him for the evangelism, but I have to correct some of the statements here, because they could lead to misunderstandings.<p><p><p>	<i>"XML-RPC specification first promulgated by Winer and his community of developers has been released for public consumption"</i><p><p><p>	Actually the specification for XML-RPC was a <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$555">collaboration</a> between Microsoft, Developmentor and UserLand, in March-April 1998. There were minor enhancements to the spec as the Python implementation came on-line in January 1999, but since then the spec has not changed.<p><p><p>	<i>"Scripting News makes an XML-RPC-compatible version of its daily news feed available for other sites to use via the new IAC mechanism. There are a number of sample implementations of the XML-RPC protocol. "</i><p><p><p>	This is not true. We make an RSS version of our daily news feed available. This has nothing to do with XML-RPC. We have an XML-RPC based feed of over 400 publications. That has everything to do with XML-RPC.<p><p><p>	<i>"UserLand's Winer is a member of the IETF's HTTP Working Group"</i><p><p><p>	Not true.<p><p><p><h4><a name="2">That's it</a></h4><p><p><p>	Otherwise it's a great article, thanks!<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
