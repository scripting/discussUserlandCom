You got me.<p>

Thanks Paul, for bringing me back to earth! ;-)</i><p>

Thanks for taking the comment in the spirit in which it was intended!<p>

Jim: <i>I admit that I haven't checked out any of the games in the open source community. I'm sure the engines you have cited are as good or better than the commercial ones.</i><p>

Well, by their nature, they're evolving, and some have been around longer than others. I cited the two that I happen to feel are most mature and feature-impressive and, perhaps not coincidentally, that have relatively robust concrete game efforts around them.<p>

Jim: <i>But there is alot more to a game than just the code. I just can't imagine how the open source community could create a game with the depth, consistancy, and playability of Diablo. Maybe I don't have a very good imagination.</i><p>

I should share my bona-fides here: once upon a time I worked at a little company called ICOM Simulations, Inc. that did a series of graphical adventure games for the Mac: Deja Vu, Uninvited, Shadowgate, and Deja Vu II. I was a playtester for Shadowgate and lead developer for Deja Vu II.<p>

Much later on in life, I worked for Activision. I wrote a quick-and-dirty utility for the Mechwarrior 2 team, maintained the Mac port of the MADE story-game engine, and was one of only two programmers who did the port of "Spycraft: The Great Game" to the Macintosh. So I've been around the game development industry for a while.<p>

There's considerable truth to your observation, I think. In particular, I feel that having a distributed development team would present significant hurdles to achieving the cohesion that a good game exhibits. But I don't know that this is absolutely true, either; in particular it seems that once a game engine (and perhaps the initial set of scenarios/maps) is largely in the bag, there are more opportunities for far-flung artists, level designers, and coders to create new levels/scenarios/maps/etc. for the engine. This must perforce be at least true to some degree&mdash;witness some of the more ambitious third-party "mod" or, even more so, "total conversion" efforts around highly popular game engines such as the Quake or Unreal families.<p>

So I think the issue is one of effectively launching a distributed cooperative development effort once you've found a group of highly talented, extremely motivated people who won't find the geographical distance from their teammates an insurmountable burden when the confusion/boredom/ennui sets in after, say, six months of development with nothing concrete to show for it (which, unless your name is John Carmack, tends to be how game development is).
