I have a HTTP server running on my laptop. MSIE is also running on the laptop, with no net connection. Using localhost or 127.0.0.1 I can construct URLs to talk to the server:<p>

<a href="http://localhost/xxx.html">http://localhost/xxx.html</a><p>

Using HTTP to connect the two seems inefficient. My server is also a COM server, couldn't MSIE send the same bits to me over COM and wouldn't it be a lot faster? <p>

<a href="com://Frontier.exe/xxx.html">com://Frontier.exe/xxx.html</a>.<p>

For Mac users, this would be like having a browser send Apple Events to Frontier instead of HTTP requests.<p>

It could be that I'm missing something or it might already be there.
