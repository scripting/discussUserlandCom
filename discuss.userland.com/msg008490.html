It usually results in a blank screen. This happens here at work with our Pac Bell 10MB SMDS conection on a T3, and at home with my 50k connection. I noticed that when I was doing a big download at home it happened every time I tried to load from discuss.userland.com. Just thought you should know. <p>

This can't look good to new customers of your upcomming products, if they are being deployed in the same manner.
