Wow.  I'm just going to sit under that one for a while, and let it sink in into my bones.<p>

That's one of those statements that just radiates truth, is completely obvious, and yet I just hadn't seen it before.<p>

I can easily recall many times where I got pissed off because I wasn't taken seriously, and I can recall many times where people have gotten angry with me because I didn't take them seriously.<p>

Playing like adults doesn't have to be hard, and taking each other seriously is the first step.<p>

Wow.<p>
