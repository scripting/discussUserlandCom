It might be worth revisiting this issue of Java performance.  You might find a few surprises - especially with regards to servers.<p>

Have you seen the story regarding the Jigsaw webserver in PCWeek, which Dave pointed to recently?<p>

<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,389496,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,389496,00.html</a><p>

Their preliminary performance results put it in line with Apache's performance.  Curious - since Jigsaw is implemented in Java and Apache is in C/C++.  This does not however, address reliability concerns.<p>

You'll also find that servlet-based web pages abound, and are quite scalable.  Naturally, the Java Developer's Connection (a Sun site) uses servlets and has a fairly heavly load.  Additionally, it uses a Java-based server, the Java Web Server.<p>

You'll also find Java lurking behind NetObject's Fusion, on the server side.  Fusion servers have never been flagged as poor performers.<p>

Additionally, it is my understanding that the Knight-Ridder newspapers serve up all of their on-line classified adds using server-side Java running against a Java OODB.  They claim to have tried several other implementations with inferior results.<p>

Finally, if you must have as fast as possible performance, check out the Java compiler from Tower Technologies.  You'll get code that runs at 98% the speed of C++.  This is a tiny penalty to pay for increased programmer efficiency.<p>

I wanted to make on other point.  You claim that Java performs just like a scripting language.  This is not true, especially in the presence of a JIT.  That partilcular characterization is not fair.<p>

In the end, I'm a big fan of scripting languages.  I use them to prototype the utilities and web applications that I then implement in Java. The performance card is way over-played.  It is not an issue on the server.<p>
