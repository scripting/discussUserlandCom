<i>Meanwhile the open-source crowd is giving away great software and making money anyway.</i><p>

That's one of things I like about the open source crowd--so few people are actually anti-business. When IBM decides to make money by supporting Linux, most of the developers are enthusiastic. When RedHat makes money selling CDs (and hires a bunch of developers at a good salary), Richard Stallman approves of their actions.<p>

There are two common attitudes in the community:<p>

<ul>
<li>"All software should be open source. Since I want all software to be open source, I'll pick a program that I need and write it myself." I respect these people because they're consistent. If they want something, they're willing to work to get it. Stallman and Miguel de Icaza (the Gnome guy) belong to this group.</li>
<li>"Not all software needs to be open source. However, I really like open source sofware, and I'll write some when I have a chance." Linus falls into this category, as do I.</li>
</ul><p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
