<b>Questions<ul></b><p>

<li>Why would Amazon be interested in this flow of information?<p>

<li>Who has more registered customers than god?<p>

<li>Who sends emails to users telling them that they would be interested in buying such and such because we know you are interested in this and that.
</ul><p>

Who cares anymore? I guess Paul Nakada is right (he's quoted at the end of the DN piece). They know who you are when you're browsing. When you go to a weird site that goes into the big database. I can still get riled up about this but it doesn't last very long. Whatever!
