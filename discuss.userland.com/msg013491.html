On that level, and on syndication, it's like Frontier. It also does ecommerce and reporting, et al.<p>

The edit this container idea is pretty neat and it seems Userland could tap into this multi-part page edit idea.<p>

Fig Leaf Software just presented Spectra at Builder Live and Allaire released the press release today apparently.  So there ought to be more info about it soon.<p>

Like the matrix, you must experience Spectra to understand (much like you must experience the immediacy and relevance of the new frontier web apps).<p>

PS - I have used Frontier to generate CF code.  I don't think it's possible in v6 with the dynamic rendering due to hardcoding of the .wsf extension (or inability to use a .cfm extension).
