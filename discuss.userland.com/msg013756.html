as far as your code over the phone, i don't know, i am no programmer.  what i can tell you is that, yes java is supposed to be supported on most major manufacturers phones, either directly or indirectly.  by that i mean, even if they don't support it, nokia, motorola, etc. have licensed the palm OS.  several are also doing work with epoch, the OS from psion.  bluetooth and jini, in laymans terms, from what i can tell, similar on the surface but i have no idea what is happening below.<p>

as far as email to the phone... more like picking it up from the phone.  as far as SMS (short message service) goes, yes it is like email and you send it right to the phone.  when you "send" it, instead of putting in and email address, you put in a phone number and boom, it's gone.  the folks from nokia told me a couple of statistics that i thought you might find interesting....<p>

finland's population is about 5.1 million people.  they are approaching 70% of the pop. has a cell phone.  teeneagers send an average of 10 sms messages a day.  average lenght of an sms message is 160 characters.  many younger fin's don't know what a check is due to most of their banking is done electronically.<p>

and just in case you are interested, AT&T has a new service out with a new phone (or it can be done with a pcmcia card) that uses their cellular service, but has an IP address assigned.  a friend of mine just got it over the weekend.  as i find out more, i will let you know.<p>

if you have any other specific questions for the new and upcoming wireless world, let me know.  if i don't know the answer, i can find someone that does.  myself and many folks that i know are involved in this new wireless world.  i will also gather links for later and add them here, but i wanted to respond while on travelling today.
