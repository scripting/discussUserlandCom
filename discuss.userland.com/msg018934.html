Sorry guys. You get 0 points each, and a negative 100 points for lack of teamwork. How could it be that a developer such as myself can't save a stinking GIF to a file on my local hard drive. It's 2000, not 1995. According to these companies, the Web likes green tints, or I didn't really pay for the software I paid for.<br><br>	It's very late.<br><br>
