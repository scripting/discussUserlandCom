I really like the discussion forum, except that I don't like the threaded messaging system. More accurately, I don't like the interface to the threaded messaging system. Since messages are nested, I'm always clicking on my back button, 2 or 3 levels at a time, to get back to where I started. I also miss responses this way.<p>

I think an excellent addition would be a 'flat' reading mode, that would compile every child response, and responses to those responses, etc, into a single page, with dividers. I didn't think I'd like the concept, but I really do! Check out <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=99/02/23/1325255&pid=0&threshold=0&mode=flat">Slashdot.org</a> for an example of 'flat' mode. The link points to a particular story on Slashdot that I'm reading in 'flat' mode.<p>

I believe it would be pretty simple to implement and I'm a believer in offering lots of different interfaces to the same information. Whatever the user wants (within reason), they should be able to get. But as a developer, I do know that sometimes, the user doesn't really want what they THINK they want. I really do want this. :)<p>

Just a thought for a nice feature.
