The downcast heads of the two sons on the left communicate their subservience; they're on autopilot, waiting to hear their father's orders.
<P>
The two sons on the right are more interesting. The youngest son (Gates) has been seated next to his father because he's the black sheep of the family, the loose canon, the one who can't be controlled so easily. Dad keeps him next to him so he can get him in a headlock if he needs to. But at the moment he doesn't need to; son Gates is engaged in what is, for him, a relatively mild act of rebellion: busting some rap, laying down rhymes with a rapid-fire delivery and appropriate inner-city hand gestures.
<P>
The son on the far right is scared of his brother Gates, and really wishes he could be sitting on the other side of Dad, with his other two brothers. You see, every time Gates gets to the end of a verse, he punctuates the rhyme by slugging his brother in the arm. In the picture, Gates is just about to do that again, and his cringing brother knows it.
