A <a href="http://www.wickedintellect.com/beta/fblogger/slide_Blogger.swf">weblog</a> rendered in Flash. The guy who did it is obviously a first-rate geek and not a very great designer. A blade of grass popping through some very fertile ground. Writers, geeks and designers. I want Scripting News beautifully rendered through Flash by the end of this year. I'll do the writing. <i>Please?</i><br><br>The new POTUS is a Mac <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/dubyasComputer.jpg">user</a>?<br><br>I'm working in a really interesting direction this morning, building my own personal My.UserLand running in Radio. I just got the first page working in a rudimentary way and am blown away by the performance. I'm now convinced this is the solution to the scaling issues in syndication. Rendering on the desktop. Give the user a lot more choices, and all the source code (infinite choice). Input is a stream of various syndication formats. Output is the same, with added human intelligence. We all get to be editors, find readers, be part of a distribution system of information. I think we're about to pop through on the next level of moving ideas around the Internet. (And giving them places to "stick" -- that's what directories are for, you know, the timeless weblog thing, the Mind Bomb for early Y2K++.)<br><br>What is a Mind Bomb, again? It's defined <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/08/26/mindBombsForY2k">here</a>. "An idea that's so strange or powerful that it explodes in your mind.

"'The company is maturing,' says Mr. Scott. 'The next wave of growth will come from the server side, with Windows 2000, but we need to see how they are doing with that in the longer term.
