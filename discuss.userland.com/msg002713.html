The piece had started off really fast, with lots of events happening very quickly, but gradually spaced out over periods of time - based upon the same fibonacci series that drove the micro structure of the piece.<p>

Well the piece had been in a 7 year beat of silence, when he told us about it, and would then be pausing for another 13 years, until it eventually went into a section - that would only begin in 35 years - and that's just for the first beat of the section!<p>

Ahhh time - what a glorious comcept.
