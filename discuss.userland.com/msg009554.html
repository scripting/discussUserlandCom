The OS needs to make life easy for browser developers, the browser developers need to make maximum use of native OS resources. When this happens, good user experiences happen.<p>

MSIE 4.5 is a very good example. It's rendering engine is slow and has a few warts (def: makes MP3 playback skip on a 300MHz G3) but it LOOKS like a Mac application, links to OS features (the Sherlock menu, reportedly gone in MSIE 5/macintosh) and interface conventions. It also has some handy outline features in the Favorites and History areas. On the interface side autofill for forms is a blessing no browser should be without and URL Autocomplete (based my favorites and history, NOT on marketing agreements) is very handy.<p>

If MSIE 5.0 on the Mac can add features (Auction Manager !) and retain a Mac look-and-feel for any widgets they add (and Carbonize the code) for feature parity with the Windows version, MS should have the best browser on the "market."
