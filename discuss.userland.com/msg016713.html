I call it the 'everything-but-kitchen-sink-solution'. WebObjects shares this space along with some MS apps as well. <p>

It comes down to how you answer the question: "What can I do with this?". If your answer is along the lines of "I don't know, what do you need done?", you've joined the club. It's a great club to be in - having tools so powerful and flexible they solve a wide range of problems (and Frontier is king of this space, IMO, and why it has to me more traits of an OS than of an app). But marketing such a thing is hell on earth. Why? Because most people don't want tools (which Frontier is), they want solutions, which Frontier isn't. <p>

Solutions are very hard. There is such a HUGE gap between identifying a problem and identifying a solution and few people realize that. Tools help those that can see a solution but need something in order to build it - but they see the path to follow. Solutions help those that can only see the problem. No path lies before them.<p>

Enter Manila and Pike. These are solutions. They address specific needs. They too are flexible but only in a way that is relevant to a specific goal. Frontier seems to not have such a goal, which is why it's such a damn good thing to build off of.<p>

Dave might not agree with that. His view might be different. But looking in from the outside, that's what I see. (Dave, I'm trying to help with this 2-way thing... ;-)
