Well yes, and no. It's pretty easy to hold a USA-centric view if you're in the USA, but the rest of us out here aint likely to see ADSL commonly in use much before 2002. In any case as backbone bandwidth increases so do the number of users. I agree the last-mile is getting wider in the USA with ADSL implmentations but not out here in the rest of the world, where ADSL and cable modems are all way too expensive.
