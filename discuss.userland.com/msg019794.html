<i>the Nautilus architecture is in place to totally remove the necessity of a conventional filesystem for users who don't want to manipulate it. We won't drive that to the interface for 1.0, but post-1.0 almost all the underlying stuff is in place and will be tied in.</i><p>

This ties into a fun bit of Macintosh history:<p>

I read somewhere (perhaps in "Insanely Great"?) that the Macintosh had a query-based filesystem prior to the first version of the Finder. I've heard it called the "20 Questions" interface. :-)<p>

I'm really happy to have some non-Unix developers lending a hand with Gnome. The Unix world has gotten many things right, but doesn't have a real depth of experience in building good GUIs.<p>

Cheers,<br>
