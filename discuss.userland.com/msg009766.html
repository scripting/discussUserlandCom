That battle was fought, it's over, and it's not the point.<p>

The point about Evolt is not one of intellectual property, but rather that the medium worked. It has been said in the past - "It's my forum, and the rules are mine, if you don't like the rules, start your own forum with your own rules".  With the internet, you _can_ start your own forum with your own rules.  The barriers to entry are your strength of belief and your intellectual capital. <p>

We didn't like a rule, so we created something that we did like. If there is to be any discussion about MJ and Evolt, it should be one about the system working.<p>

It's a good thing.  Learn from it.  It's an example of the power of the Internet and what can come out of it.  Talk about that.
