Set up a system where people make something like an escrow deposit, like $50, that is immediately charged to their credit card.<p>

Then, at any future date they can stop by the site make a micropurchase. Maybe a single MP3 is $1, but you can get 6 for $5. When your escrow runs out, you put more money in, probably with an incentive to put in larger amounts at a time.<p>

You can get your escrow money credited back to your credit card whenever you want.<p>

The vendor gets his money upfront, and can earn interest.<p>

If there was a way to get this to work across multiple vendors, then you'd really have something!
