There are a few typos (SOAP doesn't run over IIOP, for example) and there are some things I say that I have no idea what I meant. Also the interview was done in December and some things have changed, but for the most part it still accurately reflects my point of view. Best line: "Can we date before we get married?"<br><br><a href="http://roguemoon.manilasites.com/soap">Julian Bond</a>: "There's a revolution going on beneath the surface of the internet.

A common practice is to use structs to return a variable amount of information from a procedure. Apparently WSDL has no way of representing procedures that work this way. <br><br>	Second, he's written <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1355">sample scripts</a> that allow a workstation to emulate Radio's <a href="http://radio.userland.com/howToUseRadioWithManila">outliner</a> in editing a Manila site. We'd like to see two specific projects come from this. An editor that runs on Unix, perhaps emacs or vi, that through Apache, allows a user to create and edit stories and update the home page of a Manila site in the same natural way that Radio works with Manila. The other project is to write a .NET application that allows the CLR to be a great editor for Manila text in the same way. Do they have text editing tools in .NET? Would you like to use them to edit a Manila site? This is the next wire in the <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/11/30/bootstrapping">bootstrap</a> process that leads to interop. <br><br>	What's interesting about this is that you don't need to implement the whole <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/manilaRpc">ManilaRPC</a> suite to get this very important level of functionality between server-based content management and better-than-the-browser text editors on workstations. <br><br>	All you'll have to do is emulate the functionality in other scripting environments. Then we'll have a very important kind of interop, between writers on all these platforms. That's when we become transparent, when the technology ceases to be the most interesting story, when we're delivering benefits to real people. This is what <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/02/19/internet30">Internet 3.0</a> is about.<br><br><b>Gratuitous product shots<a name="gratuitousProductShots">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/03/14#gratuitousProductShots" title="Permanent link to 'Gratuitous product shots' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Gratuitous product shots' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	If you scroll up and down Scripting News you'll see shots of all our products, Frontier, Manila and Radio. Our designer Bryan Bell has done an inspiring job in adding reality to these all-electronic products. Now, a final shot of all three products together. I guess this amounts to advertising. I hope it's not too crass or commercial. <i>Enjoy!</i><br><br>	<a href="http://www.userland.com"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/groupbox.jpg" height="185" width="350" border="0"></a> <br><br>
