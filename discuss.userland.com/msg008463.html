Myuserland.root is still available is the examples section for developers to build on; I downloaded it again today, and noticed that myUserlandWebsite is not in the root. As I said, I understand that you are developing the web interface beyond what was originally released, but would it be possible to rerelease the <i>original</i> web interface code? I have found it very difficult, going through the myUserlandSuite scripts, without a reference as to how the various scripts are used. I don't think I'm asking for the crown jewels, just something to learn from.<p>


Thanks,<p>
