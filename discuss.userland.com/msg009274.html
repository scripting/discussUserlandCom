IMHO that won't work. Unlike the robots.txt which was intended to be read by programs and had a form easily parse-able by programs, the deepLink.txt file is for *users* -- most deep linking is done by users and not by programs. There is no concept of a "well written" user and its too easy and tempting to take whats there for the taking.<p>

IMHO the only way is enforcement through server side action on the part of the web master owning the site. Since there is a technical solution to this kind of problem, I can't see any merit in Universal's lawsuit. Like copyright and patent violation, deep linking should be prevented by active and vigilant enforcement if that's the intent of the owner. I expect the lawsuit to be thrown out on the basis that Universal did not take the elementary steps to protect itself adequately.
