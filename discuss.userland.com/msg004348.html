There is a lot of very formative discussions going on with the engineering team building the embeddable editor in Netscape which would really benefit from your input.  Such things as "how to make text bold"? meaning do you just add <B&gt; tags or change the stylesheet, and what about other styles effecting that piece of code? etc. etc.<p>

Input there would be really helpful I gather.
