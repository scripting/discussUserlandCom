When they were first introduced (1994? 1995?) I remember thinking that they were essentially useless to me because the main things I used the internet for (e-mail, ftp, web authoring) were unavailable because of the lack of Hotmail, etc.  I think that the feeling was pretty common.<p>

Now, on the other hand, you _can_ do most of the things you want directly on the web; I use them fairly frequently while travelling internationally (along with internet kiosks at airports).  Perhaps perceptions have not yet caught up.<p>

P.S.  I am currently in London for a few months on business -- if I am near Victoria Station at any point I'll pop in and check it out.
