Ones hears quite a bit in the Linux world that "KDE is a Windoze clone" (this being, of course, an incredible insult).  When one is looking for Windows, though, this can be a blessing.  It's really no accident that the  most user-friendly Linux distribution (Caldera 2.2) and the upcoming ultra-user-friendly Corel distribution both use KDE.<p>

If you do run KDE, you'll find yourself with a Win-like taskbar and a (Unix-like) panel.  The panel has four interesting buttons for you: the K menu ("start" menu), an icon of a folder with a lightening bolt through it ("Disk Navigator"), an icon of a folder with a little house on it (your "Home"), and an icon of a book with a light bulb on it (Help!).<p>

The K menu is nearly totally an equivalent to the Windows "start" menu.  Press it to access all KDE apps.  The Disk Navigator is patterned after the Mac Finder.  Click on it to see what I mean.  Clicking on the Home icon (or any icon with a folder on it) will pop up the file manager/web browser (kfm).  This is very similar to Microsoft Explorer.  The help browser access both KDE help (which is not all that bad) and traditional Unix help (try "man:xterm").<p>

All paths in KDE are done as URLs.  Since KDE is network transparent, you can access any file anywhere on the net with any KDE app.  For instance "kview http://206.204.24.3/snimages/daveAndPenguin.gif".<p>

You can access a terminal with "K-menu" -> Utilities -> Konsole.
