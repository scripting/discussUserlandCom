They were the same program.<p>

One combo that did this was the Navi/GNN/AOL server/press combination.  If it had had performance, it might have been a good competitor. The editing was not a separate window, it was just a toggle switch. The big thing that was, was it that there was no difference between a local file and a file on the server. I think the stuff got more complicated by commitee, and evolved into web DAV. (And AOL server could have dynamic web pages from a database using tcl. it was/is cool [and buggy, not backed by enough money, etc]).<p>

It is obvous that it takes a good programmer to write a good text editor. Why is BBedit so great? because the programmer who writes the program, uses it. Now how many programmers actually maintain a web site? Until someone who understand the needs, writes a program, nothing will seem elegant.
