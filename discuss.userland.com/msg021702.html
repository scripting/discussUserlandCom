in vagueness, you may be right</i><p>

Vagueness is also useful when being over-specific is
either wrong or careless.  Being specific can be wrong
when one really means to be more general, and a reader
misses the point.  Also, being very specific can be the
same as showing all one's cards, which amounts to
carelessness when someone else wants to spin the words.
By not saying everything, one can easily unspin most
attacks by saying still more.<p>

I'm vague myself lots of times.  I'm sure I must abuse
this more than I should.  But it also gives me more scope
to be funny through understatement, so I don't mind so much. :-)<p>

Joshua Allen: <i>-- I cannot fathom why people would value this
(beyond laziness, maybe?), but you seem to be right.</i><p>

Maybe the opposite of vague in this context is strong, rather
than specific.  Making strong statements is to be valued.  Folks
often make much weaker statements than they could.  It might be
laziness, or fear of getting too close the edge of places
where one looks foolish.<p>

Okay, but even though I like strong statements, I might not
have any such in some context, but I want to write anyway.
I think being vague for starters is a good way to open
negotiations with other folks.  That way one can use dialog
to vector in on a message one could not reach in one jump.<p>

Joshua Allen: <i>The whole point of a good vocabulary is that
it allows you to communicate more effectively, using less words.</i><p>

Yes, and I like to evangelize the use of more short and single
syllable words by using them myself more often.  I think we
should keep all the four and five letter words in play. :-)<p>

Some longer words are much more vague than shorter words.
In particular, many words of Latin extraction have roots in
common with many other words, and they can also have a large
number of meanings.  Such Latin words can easily subvert a
carefully chosen word with unintended vagueness, because a reader
must discriminate meaning in actual usage from other options.<p>

(I often weigh word efficiency in syllables rather than word
count.  A piece of text can look long but read very fast.
So using fewer words need not always be the main goal.)<p>

Joshua Allen: <i>Ability to express a great deal of meaning
in a short sentence is a hallmark of a well-designed vocabulary
(and for its domain, I think street-language does rather well).</i><p>

Yes, but vocabularies have side effects.  Words are often strongly
associated with certain contexts in which the words normally occur.
So using a word can invoke the context willy nilly.  One might
end up telling the same story told the last time a word was
used, just because readers can't turn off normative expectations.<p>

One can't always use words in perfectly a la carte fashion as
one might expect.  As soon as one says 'beanstalk' one can end
up telling a giant story whether wanted or not.<p>

Joshua Allen: <i>Generally used language in middle-class America
is shrinking, though, and I am alarmed.</i><p>

Yes, and it's disturbing.  I wonder if it's related to the
consumer culture.  (Should I leave it as an exercise to guess
why I might say that?  I'm thinking about 19th century written
correspondence culture in particular for contrast, when folks
were personally limited by vocabulary in expressing themselves.)
Maybe a dwindling vocabulary is the way to streamline the mental
roles suitable for couch potatoes (this is just a cynical joke).  <p>

Joshua Allen: <i>
Maybe people don't have big thoughts to express anymore?</i><p>

Maybe something like that. The idea of big thoughts provokes
the memory of reading Thomas Carlyle (spelling?) many years
ago.  The way he used words was crisp and intriguing, and gave
me a panicky feeling the world might have gotten more stupid
since he was alive.  But I think he was just a great writer.
