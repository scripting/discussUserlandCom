I had this same feeling right around the great link color contraversy on Scripting News. It took me a little while to figure out exactly what went wrong, and by that time, the whole thing was decided. The visited/unvisited colors switched.  They were put back, but their meaning was reversed. <p>

To this day, it takes me an extra look to remember if I've visited a link. I'm almost over it, to the point that changing the colors again will completely mess me up. <p>

It shows what subtle perceptual cues can do to comprehension and speed reading.<p>
