Music is information. Easily offering and finding music files is facilitating distribution of music files, hence, distributing information. The only part that's missing is the "free" part, although I could argue that by "free" I meant "easy" or "simple".<p>

In any case, I'm really not that interested in Napster itself; whether it was intentional or not, Napster has been very effective in promoting the concept of ubiquitous, peer-to-peer file sharing into the consciousness of the Internet community. And we shouldn't blinker ourselves: the issues being faced by the music industry are already being faced by other industries, resulting in my suggestion that an ID3-like tag be appended to file formats for video, graphics, and even text.
