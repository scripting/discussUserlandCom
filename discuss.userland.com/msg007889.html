The SBS says it is DESIGNED for companies with 50 or less employees, but it offers no client licenses.  <p>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusinessserver/productinfo/pricing.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusinessserver/productinfo/pricing.htm</a><p>

From MS's BackOffice SBS site, "A Client Access License (CAL) is required for each client computer that accesses Small Business Server, including those running Microsoft Windows&#174; 3.x, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT&#174; Workstation, Windows 95, and Windows 98."<p>

Also... "These Client Add Packs are unique to Small Business Server; you may not use them with any other BackOffice products such as standalone Microsoft Windows NT Server machines. A Small Business Server CAL is needed when accessing any service from the server, whether it be file and print or access to the SQL Server database."<p>


Here is Pricing from the page...<p>

BackOffice SBS 4.5 (with 5 client licenses) $1,499.00
Add-On 5 Client Licenses  $299.00<p>

This seems like a terribly good deal, except that the client access licenses are for The BackOffice Small Business Server software only.  This means if you buy a seperate SQL server, these Client Access Licenses don't apply to them.  <p>

Also, you will still need to buy the $2,999 per processor license to use the SQL server in an Internet environment.  The SBS doesn't get around this need.<p>


MS Licenses are structured in such a way that if you buy a license for a group package, it applies to the WHOLE group, and can't be broken into its component packages.  Thus, if you buy 5 Licenses for MS Office, you have 5 License for Office, not 5 for Excel, 5 for Word, etc.  If you have 3 Users using Word at the same time, and 2 Using Excel at the same time, you have used all 5 licenses.  The same works for Back Office when purchased as a package.
