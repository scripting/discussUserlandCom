I guess we're going to learn all about British Telecom now. Maybe this will be the case that gets the Web organized around the patent issue. It sure didn't happen with Amazon. I think I'm the only one who won't buy from them. But don't forget to include Amazon and Priceline with all the michegas about BT. And Firedrop and anyone else that has a business model based on a paper patent monopoly.
