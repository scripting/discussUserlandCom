Could you take a moment someday soon and describe just what all is "exposed" for folks to use? Like all the xml streams, the DG, alternative ETP views, syndication streams, etc. etc. <p>

All this stuff is exposed, but I think not many folks know about it.  Not to forget mailtothefuture, salonherringwiredfool, xml-rpc tester, etc. etc. <p>

It would be nice to have a central location to find all these "feeds" which you have available but not particularly obvious.<p>

For instance, when we were talking about sidebar stuff, you mentioned that there was a static rendering of every syndicated RSS site.  I'm sure many folks would love to know how to tap into that!
