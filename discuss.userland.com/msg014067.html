We get lots of comments about what people don't like, but it would also be helpful to get pointers to interfaces people *do* like.<p>

Say what you like about the interface, and tell us what you don't like (so we can focus on the good stuff).<p>

We're having a full-week planning meeting next week, and this is something I want to get educated on before we make decisions on what to do or not do.<p>

Thanks for your help.
