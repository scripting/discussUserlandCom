This certainly isn't the case.<p>

There also seems to be a rather arbitrary distinction between software development done on a consulting basis, as a service, and development done for commercial software. I fail to see the difference, but Stallman seems to see one. If time spent working on software should be uncompensated, what difference does it make who the customer is?<p>

Peer recognition is overrated, anyway. I wonder how many open source contributors feel like they got 'paid in full'? It seems to me that the vast majority of open source contributors are essentially anonymous, outshined by a few high-visibility stars.
They might get their name in a README, but does anyone <i>really</i>
remember them?<p>

Hm. I wonder if Open Source, in a way, is based on self esteem problems of programmers...
