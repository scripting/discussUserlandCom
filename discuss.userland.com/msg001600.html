"Are there any plans to allow calling directly from UserTalk to Active Scripts without using com.callScript? On the Mac, the language of each script is stored in the script object. Would it be possible to do that on Windows?"<p>

Good question. It's theoretically possible to do -- as you point out, the mechanism is already there in Macintosh Frontier to choose the language from a pop-up menu.<p>

But it's a step-by-step process. The first step is to make sure com.callScript works and see how people use it. Then we can decide whether or not to integrate Active Scripting in a way similar to OSA on Macintosh.
