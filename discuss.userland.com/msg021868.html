His son Alex, 5, is for some other transplanted New Yorkers -- his home team Giants." Note the NY point of view. Very arrogant. <i>Makes me homesick!</i><br><br><a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2840">Brent Simmons posts</a> some tips for Radio UserLand people who edit Manila sites.

Sorry dude, having a clear-channel radio station and being the southern-most and western-most team for a few years <i>means nothing.</i> However there is an interesting subtext in the piece, the idea that Mets fans might prefer a subway series. I find the idea dangerous. I'd prefer not to risk it. Bring on the Mariners. <br><br>But the Cardinals might have a philsophy after all. "I'm from Missouri," is a great one-liner.
