When you open Pike on your local machine, you open a connection to the proxy.  This connection stays open.<p>

When you click on the Pike button in Manilla, it sends the editing info to the proxy, which matches it to the connection your local Pike program is running on.  <p>

This way, the Pike program can have a firewall-friendly, always open, connection.  And the servers can behave just as they always have, only they send their info to the proxy(which forwards it via the constant connection to Pike on your machine)  <p>

Pike can then talk back to the server the regular way.(through port 80)
