I've tried to replicate the elements of the demoSite, but I must have missed something. One difference I see is that there is a #navigator in demoSite's table, and I don't have one. Is it a user-entered thing or is it generated by the code? Another difference: demoSite's #ftpSite has method = file. I'm using http. <p>

Or, to get at what I want to do, what do I need in order to display a new page after pressing Submit on any prefs. panel which just says in big bold text "your preferences have been saved"?<p>
