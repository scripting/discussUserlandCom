"The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) in Microsoft's Windows DNA 2000 provides developers with an advanced technology for building Web services and linking heterogeneous components over the Internet. SOAP provides an open, extensible way for applications to communicate using XML-based messages over the Web, regardless of the operating system, object model or language used by particular applications. Nouveau's support for SOAP allows developers to easily access CORBA applications via XML."<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11331">Eric Soroos</a> on next-generation email. He talks about using XML-RPC as a pipe for flowing email. This isn't the first time I've heard this idea. It's intriguing, because sometimes I think it should work the other way, that XML-RPC could use SMTP or POP as its transport. No reason you can't send an XML body for a mail message. But if it flows thru XML-RPC I can access email thru my object database and outliner. I think this is where email belongs.<p>

<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$535">Hannes Wallnofer</a>, the lead developer for XML-RPC for Java, proposes an approach to the "attributes question".<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11339">We had our</a> first big crash on Nirvana. It was going to happen sooner or later. Now was as good as time as any. "qbullet.sidesmiley"<p>

For Frontier users I wrote a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$1537">narrative</a> of the recovery process, and included a set of three scripts that automate a lot, but not all, of the work. As usual, full <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/enclosures/view$1537">source</a> is included.<p>

<a href="http://my.userland.com/default$2">My.UserLand.Com</a>, also running on Nirvana, seems to be fine. It missed a few hours, but it caught up.
