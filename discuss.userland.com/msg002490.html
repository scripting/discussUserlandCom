As I understand it, it's a protocol by which a computing resource
can manage a distributed task. At last year's Java One conference, they demonstrated Jini by computing the Mandelbrot set on the Java rings (see <<a href="http://www.ibutton.com">http://www.ibutton.com</a>> given to each participant. When you attached your Java Ring to a terminal, it would ask the central server for a pixel to compute, compute the pixel, and return the result. Jini provides the protocol that controls how requests flow through the system.<p>

Note that using Java lets a request, expressed as a Java applet or application, to execute on any computing hardware that supports a Java VM and a suitable network interface. In the fractal demo, the Jini server was, presumably, a Sun server, while the actual computation took place on a Java VM implemented on a single chip micro (8051, if I remember correctly).  The Jini server sends the Jini applet to the "device" (software + hardware + Java VM) to execute the Jini request.<p>

You could probably do the same thing with Frontier, or provide Jini servers, written in Frontier, that broker Java/Jini applets.<p>
