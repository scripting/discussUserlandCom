Rogers is right that the web designer never is in complete control of
a web site design, and rightly, never should be. Browser preferences
(background color, font settigns, etc.) are there for a reason. By 
over-riding these user-specified settings with HTML and CSS, you are
breaking a crucial rule of usability. <p>

Give the control back to the user

okay. I have a question. Why do people feel this way? Do they feel that designers have nothing to contribute to the content?<p>

Obviously the design is very important, because there is a desire to control it. As a designer I see this as a lack of trust, and I'm not quite sure how to feel about that.
