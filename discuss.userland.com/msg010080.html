I would have posted something similar last night, had sleep-dep not kicked in ;) There's been a discussion locally on what  PC makers has to learn from the car industry, in terms of sales practice and the quality of product that they provide.<p>

Someone made the point that we're at a stage which approximates to the early era of assembly-line automobiles, and that we're facing all the problems that car buyers in the 1920s had to deal with. There's no standard operating interface (early Fords had foot-pedal gears); there's no consistency of product, there's very little come-back if something goes wrong. You're expected to know how to get into the workings of the machine to fix things.<p>

You'd think that the PC clone vendors would learn from history, but perhaps they simply have to go through the same stage of evolution.<p>

It's an interesting debating point: what if computers were sold like cars? After all, an automobile is just as complex a piece of kit as a PC, and yet the frustrations associated with car ownership are of a very different kind to those suffered by PC owners.<p>

And yet that makes me think of the worst aspects of the car-buying experience: the commission-driven sales-staff; the red tape; the general atmosphere of the experience. What if you could buy a car as you do a Dell PC? <p>

Sir Clive Sinclair (the inventor of the most popular British 8-bit machines in the 1980s) has said that he thinks there's something fundamentally wrong-headed about the modular way in which PCs are built: what you gain in upgradeability, you lose in performance and reliability. We're still in the era of the kit-car.
