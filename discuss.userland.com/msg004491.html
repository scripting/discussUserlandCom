The Windows version runs great "out of the box" so to speak with all but a half dozen or so configuration settings defaulting to that most commonly used. Those that need attention identify your document root, give it your machine name/IP, etc. and those few items are handled via a single very well commented configuration file.<p>

Give it a try...it's really quite tasty.<p>
