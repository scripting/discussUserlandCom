I just hit Ctrl-B to edit bookmarks, and deleted all the Netscape portal stuff and the AIM button.<p>

You can drag-and-drop the little bookmark icon just left of the word "Location" in the location toolbar onto the Personal Toolbar (folder) to put your own bookmarks there.<p>

In "Edit Bookmarks", you can even create folders in the Personal toolbar folder, so that you can have categories of bookmarks in your toolbar.  When you drag and drop onto a folder, it opens up so you can position your bookmark inside it or put it in a sub-folder.<p>

Another nice thing?  You can put JavaScript in your bookmarks.  I have a bookmark called "Open" on my Personal Toolbar, and the URL for the bookmark is: (from memory)<p>

<PRE>javascript:void(window.open())</PRE><p>

I also have javascript bookmarks that resize the Netscape window to 640x480 and 800x600 sizes so I can see how my pages look in those screen sizes.<p>

I suppose it should be possible to do all sorts of neat things with javascript bookmarks, but that's as far as I've taken it.<p>
