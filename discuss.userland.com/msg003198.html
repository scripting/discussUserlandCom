Using the Discussion Group software as a learning tool is pretty overwhelming for the less experienced Frontier developer. There are usually many different ways to achieve the same end, so it's difficult to know if the given architecture (placement of items in ops/apps/www folders) was necessary or simply a matter convenience or personal preference.<p>

As UserLand winds down the development in preparation for release of Frontier 6, I humbly suggest that a skeleton sample website/application be included. This sample application wouldn't have to be as complex and functional as the DG. Instead, it would illustrate how to achieve a basic set of typical design goals.<p>

Here are some suggestions off the top of my head:<p>

<ul>
<li>one or two static pages
<li>dynamic pages
<li>dynamic pages with forms, one that returns you to the same page and one that moves you to a different page
<li>a dynamic page that grabs some data from a public server (eg. a stock retrieval)
<li>page(s) that are open to the public
<li>page(s) that are restricted by membership
<li>a page that grabs data via xml-rpc
</ul><p>

There might be a few more things others could suggest.<p>

Instructions for simulating a hit and stepping through the responder would be helpful (I know there are comments about this in the developer docs, but packaging it with a sample website would be convenient).<p>

For this sample, I think we would also benefit from a deliberate inclusion of more script comments than usual. Documentation close to the code. Once in awhile, throw in a statement like "you could also accomplish this by doing...".<p>

In some respects, preparing such a sample is not an easy job -- there is no clearly defined target to shoot at. But I think many of your current (and potential) customers would appreciate it.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li>
