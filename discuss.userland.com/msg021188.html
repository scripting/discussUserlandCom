That's your right. But I do.<p>

I don't care about RSS because you do it for me.  And I'm sorry about that comment.  I didn't mean for it to come across harshly.<p>

Things I've learned from Dave. <p>

Think win win and really mean it.  
Zig when they zag and really do it.  <p>

The whole level of confrontation is frustrating.  It bothers me when I see admirable people getting slammed, personally, about a technical specification.  Forking is always an opportunity.  But what is really important about RSS is flow.  <p>

You manage quite a lot of flow through your site and tools. Whatever syndication method you implement will be implemented by others, because lots of people believe in what you do.  Me included<p>

thanks<p>
