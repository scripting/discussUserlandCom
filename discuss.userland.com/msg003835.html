I support what you're doing, except I don't like the blue background on your <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/web/awards.html">page</a>! ;-><p>

Anyway, not sure what you mean by a web-based database that sort of magically knows how to make sense of behind-the-times sites like www.fortune.com. I guess in a sense it would be turning what's in Lawrence's head into a script and running it somewhere and then linking thru his server. I'm amazed that he has the patience to run down their articles. I prefer to let the links break, and know that my readers are smart, and that they'll figure out that I did the best I could. The only other alternative is to not bother, which is my usual solution for poorly managed sites.<p>

So, maybe you could explain more what you have in mind for the web-based database, and maybe someone around here could build it. <p>

Further, a parsing browser need not be that far away. With MSIE embeddable at least on Windows, and with Netscape open sourced, it might be possible to create a highly customizable browser. I am assuming we will get there someday in the stuff we're developing now, it works nicely, but it'll be much nicer when Frontier and the browser are the same environment.
