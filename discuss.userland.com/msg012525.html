My question for you guys is -- does anyone have any advice about the <b>best</b> way to pass this information on to someone who cares at Microsoft?  I've never been able to figure out how best to do that.<p>

For those that are interested, here are the two problems:<p>

<ol>
<li>IIS does not log file deletions.</li>
<li>In the W3C Extended Log Format, IIS screws up the server port number field.  (When, during passive FTP, a server sends to the client the port number that the client should contact to open an FTP data connection, it does so by breaking a 16-bit integer into its two eight-bit components, converting them into decimal integers, and sending them that way.  IIS, when it writes to the log, puts the two eight-bit components back together BACKWARDS.  Funny, and if you're interested, I can explain more and show examples.)</li>
</ol><p>

Thanks a ton in advance...<p>
