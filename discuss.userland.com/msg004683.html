In his WebInformant article entitled "Beware Microsoft's XML," David Strom wrote:<p>

This is already potentially misleading, if Mr. Strom intends to suggest that we may _have_ to use Office 2000 to author web pages. One of the advantages of using XML is that it is, in effect, impossible to "hide" the DTD used to generate a given document. So even if (as is quite likely) Microsoft were to create their own DTD for web-based documents, there's nothing they could do to prevent that same DTD from being used in other tools.<p>

I'd argue with this, at least in the sense that this paragraph conflates multiple issues: to upgrade an entire company's PC's from Office 95 to Office 97 _could_ be as simple as having an intranet-based software installing and tracking system capable of upgrading an entire network's PC's overnight. Marimba is an example of such a system. This has little to do with the evolution of the Office file formats.<p>

The use of XML as a metalanguage to describe Office 2000 documents by no means guarantees that future versions of Office will be backward compatible any more than Office 97 was backward compatible with Office 95. It's still very likely to remain a one-way street.<p>

Unintelligible to whom? The "naked code" presumably means that the text itself is unintelligible to human beings. So were the Word 95 and Word 97 and Excel 95 and Excel 97 and Powerpoint 95 and Powerpoint 97 file formats. Only HTML has had any pretensions of being human-readable, and as Mr. Strom himself has indirectly pointed out, one major reason for this is that it doesn't encode much information: it has historically been extremely difficult to present HTML across platforms (however you define the term) with any level of visual fidelity beyond getting the words, images, etc. of the content itself in the right order (for some loose definition of "right.")<p>

Mr. Strom is making the persistent, pernicious error of viewing XML as just HTML that sufficiently savvy developers can add their own tags to. As I've written before, this is a poor lens through which to look at XML. XML is a metalanguage for creating custom markup languages. One such markup language is HTML, but there is a literally infinite number of others that can be defined within the confines of XML. In fact, a good approach to constructing a web site--as more people are becoming aware--is to represent the data in some other XML-instantiated markup language such as RDF, and to use a tool such as XSL to generate HTML from the RDF upon request. That way you can have a wide variety of software processes--some interactive, some not--operating upon the data itself, and have a different layer that generates a human-oriented presentation language such as HTML from the data.<p>

It's not at all clear why this would be a bad thing--on the contrary, my overwhelming reaction to this idea is "it's about time!"<p>

Again, it's far from clear how this follows from using Microsoft's XML DTD's--I would expect to see WordPerfect supporting Microsoft's DTD's just as surely as they support reading and writing Word 95/97 files.<p>

Once again, this is only a problem if the other tools can't use Microsoft's DTD. Microsoft has already done a remarkably good job of becoming "the single document interchange vendor for everyone," as Mr. Strom notes earlier in his article. So what changes with their XML DTD? Nothing--except, in fact, that it makes it _easier_ to develop tools to manipulate Microsoft-format documents--unless, that is, the tools you're using are your human eyes.<p>

The industry needs to move away from "ordinary HTML v3 documents" on the web as the web continues to evolve to become less and less like a very poor broadcast medium and more and more a set of interconnected pieces of software. Human beings need a door to come in through, yes, but once past that door, machine interchange of data becomes a paramount concern--one that HTML can't address.<p>

Again, the irony here is that Office 2000 doesn't bring any advances in file compatibility--XML, in and of itself, doesn't bring any advances in file compatibility. Only to the extent that there is a consensus as to DTD's are there compatibility benefits, and it's obviously too early to say there's a consensus to use Microsoft's DTD's. (I'm not naive--I have no doubts that once Office 2000 ships, that consensus will evolve almost instantly.)<p>

But Mr. Strom's concern ultimately seems to stem from the fact that HTML doesn't encode data; it only encodes some very vague presentation guidelines and is thus all but trivially human-understandable. That's obviously been a strength in terms of the promotion and explosive growth of the World-Wide Web: anyone with a text editor can be a publisher. While XML-instantiated documents do lean towards changing the "text editor" to "document processor," it will remain the case that anyone with a decent XML-based document processor can be a publisher _and_ we'll have derived the additional benefit that Internet-based sites (Web-based or otherwise) will have a means for expressing their _information_ in a fashion that other Internet-based sites (human-based or otherwise) can profitably manipulate.<p>

If there's anything that we need to beware of, it's the insistence that we never allow a computer to elevate its approach to some process that was initially in human hands beyond our complexity horizon. The fact that we could, in the beginning, understand HTML doesn't mean that we should forbid the use of XML, XSL, CSS, DSSSL, DHTML, and whatever else allows us to create a longer lever online and gives us a place to stand.<p>
