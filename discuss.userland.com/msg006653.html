The "Save" does HTTP PUT, so there's no FTP, and the save dialog browses the web server's space.  An author can apply permissions to pages or subtrees.  Finally, pages that are saved can be archived (so you can see old versions, or undo a revision) and have the text indexed, so that you can search the contents of the site.  NaviPress, which gave rise to AOLpress, was originally conceived as a publishing system that used the web as a UI metaphor.  It was ahead of its time when it came out.  Now, WebDAV has done a lot of what AOLPress was trying to do then.  BTW, AOLServer makes a lot of the AOLPress features easier to use, but it's not essential -- most of the features work pretty well with other servers, such as JigSaw.
