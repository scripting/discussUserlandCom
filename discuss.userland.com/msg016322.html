A news-oriented home page, three subordinate pages. Easy for new people. I asked Doc for permission to point to the site with the understanding that this is just a mock-up. We're mainly interested in knowing which  browsers it breaks. With these caveats, here's the <a href="http://docsnewsite.weblogs.com/">test site</a>.<br><br><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16351">Unusual phone call</a>: "They want to get together to talk about the history of this business, but they don't want the usual story, the folklore so often repeated, Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Marc Andreessen, etc."<br><br>WSJ: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/158521.asp">Stocks jump amid tentative rebound</a>. "Stocks rallied late Monday to close near the day’s highs as investors stepped cautiously into the market after last week’s dramatic losses to seek out some bargains."<br><br>Oddly, this <a href="http://www.liberty.org.uk/cacib/">British site</a> is hosted in the US. Apparently some British person doesn't like them, and that's enough to get them knocked off. <br><br>Keeping the record up to date, today we sent payment for May to Conxion. I sent this <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$577">email</a> to Steve Martin explaining why.<br><br><a href="http://www.conxion.com/" title="End users and Wall Street punish e-businesses that crash."><img src="../images/blackholebrain/skullzilla.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0"></a>BTW, I just thought I'd add this: Conxion Sucks. And so do the members of the press who didn't care whether our ISP shut us down over things I said on this site. There's a special place for people like that. We'll turn the Web into a high-integrity environment for journalism with or without their help. Imagine if the ISP for the San Jose Mercury News shut them down because he didn't like being called on interfering with their independence. I wouldn't lift a finger to help them. Well, maybe I'd lift *one* finger. ";->"<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/financial/columns/041400norris-column.html">NY Times</a>: "There's financial alchemy for you. Take one big profitable company. Dissect it. Get two unprofitable ones trading at absurd prices."<br><br>I just got an <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/zapletFromFiredropUsersGroupMeeting.gif">email</a> from Firedrop inviting me to a user's group meeting. Of course the email was a zaplet. Nice! But you have to sign a non-disclosure agreement. And look at the message carefully. They included the email addresses of people they were inviting. <i>Patent pending!</i><br><br>You know what's wrong with patents? What if you patent something and no one uses it? That must be a bummer. There were only about 35 names on the Zaplet email. One was from Uruguay, so it wasn't just local people. And the names were all over the alphabet, so I don't think it was just all the D's. I imagine the $50 million sitting in the bank and them sitting around wondering if they could pay people to be excited about their product. Send everyone to DisneyLand? Would that require a non-disclosure?<br><br>An EditThisPage site that <a href="http://post695.editthispage.com/2000/04/17">uses gems</a>.<br><br>William Crim: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16352">Is there or isn't there a "Digital Divide"?</a><br><br><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16342">Chris Langreiter loves</a> REBOL.<br><br><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16328">Jacob Levy</a>: "There are many more sellers than buyers."<br><br>Jacob points to the Smart Money <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/marketmap/">MoneyMap</a> Java app. Fantastic.
