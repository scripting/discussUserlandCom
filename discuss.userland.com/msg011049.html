My other idea was to run all the links you click through the proxy, so it keeps a persistent history of the pages you visit. Or at the very least, keep track of the last time you visited a certain bookmark. I really miss that on my bookmarks page - if I'm moving between Web browsers, I often want to see "the last time I visited Scripting News was 8 hours ago" or something, because I tend to forget. One thing I think would be really useful (and I don't know why any browser don't do it) is to make the visited link color slowly change back to the active link color as the page has been visited longer and longer ago, and is about to expire from the persistent history.<p>

Anyway, lots of ideas, little time for implementation, wish I wasn't so busy. Sigh.<p>
