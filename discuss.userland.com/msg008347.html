When IS imposed a VCS on us that was web-based, all it did was discourage developers who already didn't need a reason to resist the whole concept of VCS. This was an intranet app, but there really was no reason to webify it -- and there were perfectly good client/server options available, but no, everything has to be coming out of your browser.<p>

Can you imagine how quickly developers stop checking in source code as frequently as they should, when they have to go to a bookmarked page, log in, navigate, wait for page loads, click a file upload button, and file-nav to their file, then click submit and wait for a response?<p>

Back around '89-'92, my employers were always begging me to get the data onto their laptops, so they could work on the run. They didn't want to connect to servers to get data -- it was an impractical way to work.<p>

Today, these same guys are hyped about webifying the very same apps (leaving their data on the server) because everyone else is doing it! (I shouldn't mock them, I've got a yahoo email account.)<p>

And hey, you don't have to write a client -- so it'll cost less!<p>

I don't know if anyone has ever factored the PHB factor into TCO.<p>

Hey on a related note, I caught this link from Cafe au Lait Java -- <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,38716,00.html?st.ne.fd.gif.e">browser clients are putting on a little weight</a>. There goes the cross-platform glory of the web. Seems like trying to be platform neutral by considering yourself an internet developer may be harder than I thought.
