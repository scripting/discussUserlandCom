But when I first became aware of Xanadu, I hoped that I would someday get to see it.  I'm looking forward to browsing the code, especially the Smalltalk code.
<p>
I notice that they complain about ParcPlace's ridiculously high runtime licensing fee prevented just releasing the Smalltalk code.  I wonder if they know about ParcPlace's new "non commercial" versions of their products.  They're all full commercial releases, free for the download.  Now the ONLY charge is for runtime licensing.  Meaning that all of us in a hurry to see things like the Enfilade stuff could just get a non-commercial copy of VisualWorks and load in the current Xanadu code.
<p>
I'd really like to play with THAT.

Oh yeah.  ParcPlace is now <a href="http://www.objectshare.com">http://www.objectshare.com</a> .
