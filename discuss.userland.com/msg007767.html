The bottom line is that if the market deems it, someone will create a browser/writer. Certainly, someone could do it now with IE5. You can add a browser COM object to a lightweight text editor, and there you go. In fact, Microsoft pushes the idea of adding the browser COM object to applications, and vice versa (customizing IE5). I bet one of the many hackers visiting these boards could do it, if sufficiently challenged.
I would also argue that, as bulky and cumbersome as it is, you can use Word 2000 and IE5 in a way that comes pretty close to an integration of the two processes. If you save a Word 2000 file as an HTML file, it retains all its style information by using XML namespaces. No one can accuse Microsoft of elegant solutions, but it works.<p>

That said, from what I've read of Dave's posts, it's not really what he's looking for. I would think the ultimate solution would be cross platform. Maybe Java, if the various VM porting headaches could be resolved. Again, if there's demand, someone will do it.
