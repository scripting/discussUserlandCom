Let's grant that raw file sharing makes for an uninteresting biz model. Big deal journalism - not. As if Napster or its VCs ever believed that themselves.<p>

But enough of Napster.<p>

Radio Userland starts with the necessary p-to-p precondition (access to shared files or, more precisely in this case, shared playlists, weblogs, email and chat from distributed servers - let's leave mp3s as an undefined issue) and enables users to add "intelligence" to the files.<p>

Perhaps this is an element (the element?) of what Dave implies by P = people ....<p>

or<p>

P = People = Value-Add(Intelligence)<p>

Let's grant the possibility that there ain't money in intelligence. As Dave has pointed out, the curious way that the Web frustrates classic money-making schemes isn't necessary a bad thing.<p>

Minimally, applications, even in the simple form of enriched players that augment free players, can be sold.<p>

Editing tools can be sold. Programming environments can be sold. Web servers can be sold. Radio Userland, therefore, can be sold.<p>

As for the bigger fish:<p>

If, no when, the Web converges on a model for distributing music (whether classic, heavy-handed watermarking, tips or ?), Radio Userland will be ready to play because it is agnostic on that side of the revenue model.
