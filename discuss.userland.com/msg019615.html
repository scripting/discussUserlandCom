I was doing a "Save-a-Copy" on a bunch of roots and one especially large GDB ended up in the "themes" folder in my "ops" folder. I didn't know this had happened. However when I restarted, Frontier promptly hung. It took a while to figure out what was causing the hang.<p>

[Request] Can manilaSuite.themes.scanFolder check for/ignore any large guest databases that just happen to fall into the themes folder? Any way to idiot-proof this?<p>

Clay -- bad things happen before that second cup of coffee.
