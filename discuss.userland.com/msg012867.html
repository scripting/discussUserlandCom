If any of you have a burning desire to work with us on this immediately, post a response. We could probably get a couple more sites going now. <p>

What I'm really looking for are weblog sites that can cover the scripting languages and runtime environments that I don't cover on Scripting News. That's most of them, of course, I basically know Frontier, and that's about it.<p>

I had this flash this weekend, I don't know why it took me so long, but we has the perfect space on Scripting News for sites covering each of the interesting environments. Look down the left edge, I could stack up to 100 links, starting with Perl, JavaScript, AppleScript, Tcl, PHP, Cold Fusion, etc.<p>

Tomorrow I'm going to put up the first of these links, Luke's site.<p>

That's all I'm going to say right now. If you're on the Frontier-users list, you already know what site I'm talking about. ";->"<p>

Things are really coming together now. Lovin it.
