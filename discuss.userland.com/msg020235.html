However, to be ethical, a license must not contain the GPL's poison pill. The purpose of the GPL is to advance a specific agenda which is harmful. It is therefore <i>never</i> appropriate or ethical to use it. I fear that too many developers have followed, like cattle, along Stallman's path without recognizing where it leads.
