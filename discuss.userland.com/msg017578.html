You're not so weird.  I have used a similar question: "What is it that you are most afraid of saying?" that has helped me make quite a few breakthroughs in trying to work through my own personal bullshit.<p>

I would bet that saying what you are afraid of hearing is very powerful, reducing what was once a very large monster into a tiny little flea.  And then you can recognize it, laugh at it, and leave it behind.<p>

I wish I could remember to do that more often.  Especially after a particularly bad weekend, which has me struggling to stay positive this morning.<p>
