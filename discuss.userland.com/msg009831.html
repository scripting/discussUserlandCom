The intent is to provide a full-text equivalent for the abbreviation so that, for example, a search engine can index the full-text instead of the acronym itself. Or perhaps a text processor could do the 'right' thing with any acronyms it finds, i.e., replace the first instance of the acronym with the full text followed by the abbreviation in parens, and replace any subsequent instances of the full text with the abbreviation.<p>

The LANG attribute specifies the language used in the TITLE attribute.<p>

See also <ABBR>, which has the same attributes.<p>

Plus, if the browser supports it, you can view the expansion in a help balloon, in the same way that IE handle the TITLE attibute in an <A> tag.<p>

The spec says some thing about enabling possible future browser technologies, so perhaps iCab's support for the tag simply means popping up a help balloon.<p>

The future is now, and it's name is iCab! ;o)<p>
