Guess who had to build that sucker?<p>

Since I had the pic, I uploaded it to my prefs at <a href="http://prefs.userland.com/">http://prefs.userland.com/</a>. I don't see the picture anywhere.<p>

This could be very savvy editorial control; my picture might scare away visitors! But it might also be a non-functioning feature or it might even be broken.<p>

Am I supposed to see my mug staring back at me somewhere?<p>
