Really complete set of functions. I like it alot.  However, very slow over 28.8.  Next week I'll be able to try with faster connection.  <p>

I'm a typical non-programmer user.  I bounce around alot and would like to access my tools over the net.  I use a personal db to track work notes- it would be lovely to pull that up into an My Home frame at will. Forget launching (or never quitting)- just click.  Someday things will be that fast and transparent. Meanwhile, the beauty of personal portals is wysiwywant-I know a lot of my clients are clamoring for that, along with a comprehensible config interface.  You're doing it.  Thanks
