If there was a way to change email addresses, I sure didn't find it. The whole account appears to me to be keyed off email address.<p>

Now, we could let you change your email address, but when you log in you'd still have to use the original email address to identify yourself. Otherwise we'd have to let anyone who wants your data to have it. Would you like us to do that? (I won't do it.)
