It really mucks with the "back" command in the browser.  If you go to a page that has been redirected using this technique, and then hit the back arrow, you go back to the redirect apge, and thus back to where you began.<p>

Luckily the newest versions of Navigator and IE allow you to skip back over a site in the history list, but it's still kind of annoying.<p>

But it's probably the best you can do at this point.
