When you edit a page in a Manila site, if you're the type of person who doesn't like to look at HTML tags, now you won't have to.<br><br>	Hey it's shipping.

Each database can have data, <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$689">nodetypes</a>, HTTP <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1028">responders</a>, XML-RPC <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1075">handlers</a>, SOAP <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/soap">handlers</a>, a suite of scripts, a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier/gifs/hiersharedmenu.gif">menu</a> of commands, a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1356">thread</a> that runs in the background and a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1006">Website Framework</a> website. Every trick the pros use. And the really cool thing about Tools is you don't have to link these babies into the right places in Radio.root, that's done <i>automatically.</i> It's never been easier to extend the environment.

A courier. Please sign for this. On the outside of the envelope, "Attn: Service Agent". It's from Wilson Sonsini, a famous Silicon Valley lawfirm. Service agent! (I'm being served.) Not a good thing. <br><br>	Should I sign for it or not? Maybe Conxion is suing me? Maybe I've infringed on a patent? As I open the envelope I wonder how my life is changing.<br><br>	All for naught. I forgot to send back my release for the <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/000926/ca_critica.html">merger</a> of Peer Logic with Critical Path. It's a late notice. Easy to deal with.

Instead, the ebXML initiative chose MIME-XML technology to wrap and send the message."<br><br>	This wasn't a surprising development. The goals of ebXML, as far as I can tell, are much more complex than those of SOAP. Further, the things that ebXML does that SOAP doesn't, put it squarely against BizTalk and <a href="http://www.uddi.org/about.html">UDDI</a>, all the extras Microsoft and the B2B vendors are adding to SOAP. (That's probably what the "too closed an architecture" comment is about.)<br><br>	These are of no more concern to me than the things ebXML does. I am not a B2B technology vendor, and I'm happy to have compatibility with Microsoft's software at the SOAP level, for now; and I think that some parts of Microsoft will produce software that our stuff will connect to. <br><br>	I'm looking for a mass market, something like the Web browser was in 1994, but coming from <i>lots</i> of independent developers working together. I get excited when I hear that people like Philippe Kahn and Rohit Khare (and three other genius-level developers who must remain nameless at this time) are building user-level products around SOAP, and nothing more than SOAP. <br><br><b>SoapWare<a name="soapware">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/02#soapware" title="Permanent link to 'SoapWare' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	SOAP is a remote procedure calling protocol, as I see it, it's not doing the same things as ebXML. I'm sure their goals are noble, and the software and services they deliver will be useful, but I'm interested in the Internet as a creative environment, so I see SOAP differently, to me, it connects user-level tools into clouds of content. My vision is far more focused than the Dot-Net vision, and the (apparently competitive) ebXML vision.<br><br>	It can be so simple, just do the things we were doing with COM and Apple Events, but do it over the Internet. No lock-in. Happy users. And to open source developers, this can be a basis of friendship. IBM's SOAP implementation is open source. Let's get all the environments wired up and validated, and start building great reliable clouds for all the users who will soon be running SoapWare on their desktops.<br><br>	(I checked, SoapWare.Com and SoapWare.Net are taken.)<br><br><b>Random notes<a name="randomNotes">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/02#randomNotes" title="Permanent link to 'Random notes' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.quicktopic.com/4/H/RJxvUjWnrveKSCunnsa">Jim Flanagan</a>: "The Internet interprets Dave Winer having a bad day as damage and routes around it."<br><br>	Our servers are getting pounded by spiders again.

The Tools feature gives the users a chance to think about what I'm thinking about.

FoRK is a free-wheeling list. It's a good place to bring tough issues, you'll get flamed, for sure, but a large number of smart people are there, and the list cuts through the BS pretty quickly. The CMS list is quite different. I mostly listen there, to get an idea of what system developers are <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cms-list@camworld.com/msg00480.html">thinking</a> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cms-list@camworld.com/msg00486.html">about</a>, I've learned a tremendous amount just from lurking on the list. <br><br>	Perhaps there's a need for a CMS vendors list, also professional, where vendors talk among ourselves about standards and other issues we can address as a group.<br><br>
