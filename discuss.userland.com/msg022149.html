He also posted a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xml-rpc/message/2415">message</a> on the mail list inviting developers to work with him on these new tests. It may be confusing at first, but it's worth it, imho. Please ask questions. We want to build a set of matrices like the ones <a href="http://jake.soapware.org/currentXmethodsResults">we have</a> for SOAP that show results of pair-wise interop testing. Bugs show up this way, it leads to interesting discussions, new questions about what interop means, and ultimately better software.<br><br><a href="http://www.craigburton.com/2001/04/15">Craig Burton</a> has a fantastic Java-based tutorial for creating directories with Radio and Manila.<br><br><a href="http://www.macworld.com/2001/04/16/seybold-osx.html">MacWorld</a>: "If everyone's so committed to OS X, exactly where are all the products?"<br><br>Globe and Mail: <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/gam/Managing/20010416/MGCARR.html">Firms underestimate power of blogging</a>. <br><br><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/04/16">One year ago today</a> we were wondering if it was just a correction. <br><br><a href="http://www.mattgoyer.com/resume.html">Matt Goyer</a> is looking for a job.<br><br><a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1626?mode=day">Chris Langreiter</a> did an XML-RPC interface for an online image database. <br><br><a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1625?mode=day">Michael Montague</a> is doing a version of Emacs that can edit Manila sites through XML-RPC. <br><br><a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1627?mode=day">David Detlefsen</a> is working on connecting Python to Manila through XML-RPC. <br><br><a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/theXmlRpcMan">The XML-RPC Man</a> gets his own page. <i>Arf arf!</i><br><br><a href="http://www.evhead.com/longer/trellix_essays.asp">Evan Williams explains</a> his deal with Trellix.<br><br>Devxpert: <a href="http://www.devxpert.com/tutors/wsdl/wsdl.asp">Introduction to WSDL</a>. <i>For VB programmers.</i><br><br><b>A weird idea<a name="aWeirdIdea">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/04/16#aWeirdIdea" title="Permanent link to 'A weird idea' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'A weird idea' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	Here's a weird idea. Let's be nice to someone today. Ask them how they're doing. What's up with you? Listen. Tell someone you like them. Did I ever tell you how much I enjoy talking with you? Go for a walk. Look up, what do you see? Greet a stranger. Hello there. Pet a pup. Hello nice doggie. Want to fetch something for me? Good job. You're a smart dog, yes yes. Make this day about someone other than you. That's my plan.<br><br>
