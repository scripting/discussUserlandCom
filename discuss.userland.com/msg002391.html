I will be teaching a Frontier course on February 1-2 (this one is full).  One of the things I want to cover, first thing on Feb 1, is what Frontier is all about, and why it's worth choosing and using.<p>

Below is a series of questions I would like to get opinions and perspectives on from as many people as possible.<p>

The questions are:
<UL><LI>
<b>Why is Frontier a powerful content-management tool?<LI></b>
<b>What other packages have feature-sets comparable to Frontier, and how much do they cost?<LI></b>
<b>Is Frontier better than other products in its price range?  If so, why?<LI></b>
<b>What can you do with Frontier that you can't do as easily (or at all) with other tools?<LI></b>
<b>What are the best resources on the Internet for Frontier software and knowledge?</b>
</UL><p>

Thanks in advance for your help and positive energy,<p>

Jim Roepcke</li></li></li></li></li>
