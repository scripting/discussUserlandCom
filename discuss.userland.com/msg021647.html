Gnutella worked fine until the Napster trial, at which point things slowed down badly as users migrated across. Right now, the best alternative seems to be the alternative Napster networks listed at <a href="http://www.napigator.com">http://www.napigator.com</a> -- what might be interesting is an overlaid system, which centralises the search mechanism, but uses Gnutella's distributed capabilities as a metasearch in order to locate those central servers.
