<li>
Neither results in royalties to artists/RIAA
<li>
Used Record stores buy an apparently unlimited supply of albums, then resell them. Napster allows access to an unlimited supply of songs.
<li>
Both turn people on to music that they would not otherwise buy, at prices that are less than a normal retail cd.
<li>
Used record stores have a markup, and their cost of sales are not nil. Napster has no markup, nor does it have cost of sales. 
<li>
Used record stores have turned a profit, and they deal in real world goods. 
<li> Used record stores have a better selection of non-popular music (at least in seattle, and compared to a couple recent napster searches over the weekend)
<li>
The RIAA would rather not have either of them in existence<p>

thoughts?<p>
