I can't really say that I want to do that, I would never use such a client, and that makes it really hard to support (for me anyway). I'll gladly point anyone to the 3 lines of code that require OS 8.6, and they can build off my work to make a client that is happy working all the way back to 7.x systems.<p>

The one gotcha is that the xml tools osax requires a PPC. This might pose a problem for some people.
