<i>Sybase comes with the Redhat distribution. I think DB2 is also available free for Linux but couldn't swear to it.</i><p>

For a few months this fall, most of the major commercial databases were free for Linux. Here's how it happened:<p>

<ul>
<li>Informix (I think) released an educational version of Informix SE. Their press release bragged about all the students who would use Informix.</li>
<li>Almost immediately after, Oracle released an unsupported demo version. I guess they didn't want all those students to be using Informix. :-)</li>
<li>All the RDBMS vendors except Microsoft announced Linux support shortly thereafter. Again, a lot of these were unsupported free versions. The database companies thought that Linux was for advertising to students and after-hours hackers, not for production systems.</li>
<li>The database companies started getting phone calls from major accounts, asking about Linux. It seems that a number of very influential IT managers wanted to be running Linux.</li>
<li>The database vendors issues a second round a press releases, announcing real support for Linux. Some demo versions were quickly replaced by not-so-free production versions.</li>
</ul><p>
