spec needs some extra clarification.  You could
interpret the spec as saying that it can be either
a <value> or an <array> or a <struct>, but the
example doesn't support that theory, and it
says that each <param> must have a <value>.<p>

Does it work better if you convert the longlats
to integers?<p>

As for the comment, note that the spec requires
the client to provide a "User-Agent" field.  One
could argue that it's enough to provide the version
info in one place...
