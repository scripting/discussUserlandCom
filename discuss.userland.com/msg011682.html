At least one (free) browser, HyMinder(?), supports this: On your screen, Doc A has hyperlinks to Doc B, but if you look at the source of A and B, there are no links--they are all in Doc C. <p>

I've heard rumors that the question of whether to include this feature is what kept the XLL spec (now XPointer/XLink) from being released about 2 years ago! Of course, the question was whether it was technically feasible, not ethically correct.<p>

This kind of linking seems to make ThirdVoice-like setups a certainty. So it's a good thing we are debating the ethics now, whle they are still rare and small scale.
