Thanks Dave for all the spirited writing and the community you built around Frontier, Scripting News and Davenet in these last four (four? five?) years.<p>

Thanks all you from Userland for the great software and sheer power you give us.<p>

Thanks to all Davenet and Scripting news readers (famous or not) who enrich the site and all the discussions with great and enriching opinions instead of the more common flame wars on other communities.<p>

Thanks to all involved with the Open Source movement for working so hard developing great software just for the love for it.<p>

And finally thanks Jon Postel for all he's done for the Internet.<p>

Happy Thanksgiving,
Vitor Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o
Brazil
