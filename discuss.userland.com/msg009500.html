From my trawling on the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">US Copyright Office website</a>, the apparent answer is yes, that it would be a copyright violation.<p>

From the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/circs/circ01.pdf">Copyright Basics</a> circular (warning -- a PDF file lurks at this link), copyright is immediately affixed to a literary work (which is supposed to be very broadly read -- the Office even says that computer applications are considered literary works) at the moment of authorship, even without a little (C) symbol or anything like that.  Only the original author has copyright on the work, and thus has the right to directly control republication and reuse.<p>

Granted, there are exceptions to this -- like the Fair Use exception.  But to claim that exception, you generally can only quote small passages for the purposes of comment; members of the press have been allowed to quote entire tracts, but then that would mean that the standard press handling of requests for confidentiality would also apply here.<p>

Very interesting question indeed...<p>
