We're going to use the wizzy HTML editor to get HTML tags out of the way of people who just want to write and are intimidated by HTML. <p>

Since MSIE is the only browser that offers this capability, and it's also the most widely used browser, it's a no-brainer <i>first step.</i> But I hope it's just a first step, we want Microsoft to have competition, so when Mozilla/Netscape are ready and when we have the development resources, we want to offer a choice of renderers.
