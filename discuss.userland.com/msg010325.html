the blue & milky-white.<p>

I was sort of expecting the gray; the iBook's orange and blue
are turning up everywhere (Gap clothes, IKEA lamps), along
with greys, which Apple hadn't shown yet. There are actual
annual trade books which cover the colors that will be 'hot'.
I expect that's where they found the iBook colors.<p>

I'm left wondering why the Cinema Display is so much more expensive ($1k?) than SGI's version of the same thing. Perhaps it uses a larger LCD to display the same number of pixels.
