I've had another squiz at it, and...<p>

I'm still getting the same error. A couple of things have changed:<p>

-- I've updated my manila.root to get the fix to getScriptingNewsXml.<p>

-- Just to make sure I'm not a total idiot, I ran xml.compile over the xml file. This gave me no errors, and built a table, which contains two subtables, one for the ?xml header line, and another for the scripting news node and its children (header, item, item, item...).<p>

This is totally hunkydory, AFAIK, so I'm stumped.<p>

BTW, is "the guy" me? I don't think I said bug anywhere, and I'm pretty sure that my HTML wasn't broken, except for one incident with <IMG&gt;</IMG&gt; tags, which I ruled out by removing the images. No hard feelings or anything, it's just a bit confusing.<p>

How should I proceed from here?
