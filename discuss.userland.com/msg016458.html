I personally agree that Word isn't writer friendly - but it's close enough for most people to accept. One distinction in this comparison is that writers often don't have any say on anything but the content of their writing. The result is that the tools for an artist often impact the final product very directly (they are used from start to finish), where for a real writer, it's merely a middle step before that content is handed off to something else - be it the webmaster, editor, layout designer, etc. So you'd need to include such products as brainstorming, layout, production, etc. tools to build a comparable market to the artistic market. When you do that, you find that MS doesn't play a very big role at all and there is a great deal of diversity there.
