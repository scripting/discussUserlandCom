Leeme recap and see if I got it.  <p>

You want the cookie to be for userland.com, not just for nirvana.userland.com or discuss.userland.com.  <p>

If that is the case, then this is from Netscape's developer's homepage about cookies.<p>

=====<p>

A CGI program uses the following syntax to add cookie information to the HTTP header:<p>

Set-Cookie:
   name=value
   [;EXPIRES=dateValue]
   [;DOMAIN=domainName]
   [;PATH=pathName]
   [;SECURE]<p>

[snip- clipped some mundane stuff]<p>

DOMAIN=domainName specifies the domain attributes for a valid cookie. See "Determining a Valid Cookie". If you do not specify a value for domainName, Navigator uses the host name of the server which generated the cookie response.<p>

[snip- Here is the text of "Determining a Valid Cookie"]<p>

Determining a Valid Cookie<p>

When searching the cookie list for valid cookies, a comparison of the domain attributes of the cookie is made with the domain name of the host from which the URL is retrieved.<p>

If the domain attribute matches the end of the fully qualified domain name of the host, then path matching is performed to determine if the cookie should be sent. For example, a domain attribute of royalairways.com matches hostnames anvil.royalairways.com and ship.crate.royalairways.com.<p>

Only hosts within the specified domain can set a cookie for a domain. In addition, domain names must use at least two or three periods. Any domain in the COM, EDU, NET, ORG, GOV, MIL, and INT categories requires only two periods; all other domains require at least three periods.<p>
