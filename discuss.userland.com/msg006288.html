What matters to me is that they got rid of the Unix philosophy, with its arcane filesystem layout and kludgey X server (among other things).<p>

However great the various Open Source benevolent dictators may be, many of them are hard-core Unix people, and it's very difficult to get along with them if you don't like Unix. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the Unix philosophy, but I just <i>don't want it</i>. It might be interesting to see what the Linux community's response would be to a non-Unix-like OS based on Linux; that would be a real test of maturity IMO.<p>

For device drivers, I like the idea of having backwards binary compatibility. I like the idea of being able to install drivers without having to compile anything. Any OS that doesn't provide that is going to annoy me.
