After going to a concert, the first since using Napster, I've been exploring Sting music released after The Police split up. Some wonderful stuff, like Fields of Gold. What a beautiful song.</I><p>

If you're a big Sting fan, (like me) you should check out some of his videos as well. <A HREF="http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=3667">Bring on the Night</A> is probably the best, but there is another (I can't recall the name at the moment) where their performance of "Roxanne" is really wild. The audience goes nuts and pulsates like one huge organism.<p>

(added later) I'm pretty sure the tape with the cool performance of Roxanne is <A HREF="http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=112313">Sting - Soul Cages Concert</A>.<p>

"Bring on the Night" was made shortly after the breakup, so you can feel some of the uncertanty of whether he will make it or not in the various interviews. He had some awesome musicians with him at that time. (i.e. Branford Marsalis)<p>

You got me in the mood to listen to "A Thousand Years"!<p>
