without discussion chris langreiter, the young weblogger from Tyrol, Austria is one of the sparkling stars in europes weblog-heaven. because of his very fresh and universal writing style his weblog langreiter.com , dressed as wiki-wiki-clone written in REBOL, attracts more and more users every day. A beautiful piece of code called vanilla.<p>

very early chris adopted his rebol-server to talk xmlRpc. knowing this i approached him 10 days ago with the request to further improve his RXR-Rebol-xmlRpc interface and surprise, surprise  over night he practically extended his wiki-server in a way it became the perfect xmlRpc client-server environment. <p>

so over the weekend on my side i completed a vanilla suite developed especially with Radio Userland in mind. in accordance with the manila.verbs suite it is now possible in a very elegant and efficient fashion to publish with RU directly to chris' fabulous wiki-server. <p>

look at this <a href="http://on1.zkm.de/vanilla.jpg">screenshot </a>and then visit <a href="http://www.langreiter.com">http://www.langreiter.com</a> and you will realize how well RU and vanilla work together.first you load a list of all existing wiki-spaces from the server, listed by name in an outliner. then you load the content of specific space with a rightClick-command. when the content is inside your RU odb it's easy to edit the wiki-snippets and send them back to the wiki-server. I had a lot of fun developing this interface, cause RU is extremely cool and to work with chris means real fun. i enjoyed it.<p>

on the other side i am convinced it will be now very easy to connect RU to wiki-wiki servers implemented in other languages than Rebol. overall using RU as a perfekt wiki-editor could broaden RU-userbase enormously.<p>

by, by, tom <p>

p.s.: there is more in the pipe, stay tuned
