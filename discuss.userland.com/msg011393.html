We wanted to comment on a few of the specific issues [as for the "is this a good or bad idea/implementation" question, we'll step aside:-)]  Any inaccuracies on our part are primarily due to sleep-deprivation...<p>

We're working on getting our API together and putting it out as quickly as possible - the earliest will be "later this Fall," which is about as specific as we can be.  Otherwise, it seems people here are experiencing the frustration of our incomplete Beta - we're pushing hard to get cross-platform/cross-browser support, get our new Web site up with our Privacy Policy, etc.  We certainly share Philip Suh's browsers frustration, but we think we're close to expanding our support - the main reason we stuck with just JavaScript/DHTML was to have the possibilty of being available on all platforms.<p>

The speed and responsiveness of the system is our main focus these days, as you can imagine.<p>

Thanks for the curiousity in what we're up to - we're a work in progress like everything else on the Web and are trying to get better everyday.<p>
