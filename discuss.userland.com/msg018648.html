I've been trying to put into words my feelings over that ..."article", but I think you nailed it for me.  I hate posting "me too"s, but I need to say... "me too".  <p>

Before reading your post, only foul language came to mind, and that's why I've held back from posting myself.  Trash journalism exemplified.<p>

There is a book called Data Smog by David Shenk, that I would highly recommend, that hits this topic very well.  You may come away disagreeing with Shenk's analysis but it gets your brain cells churning which is never a bad thing.<p>

Speaking of Data Smog, Scripting News, for me, has always been a tool to cut right through it.
