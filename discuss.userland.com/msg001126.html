At first I thought I'd use that book alot when I was learning Windows programming, but it turns out I didn't.<p>

In descending order, the books that have most helped me are:<p>

Programming Windows 95 by Charles Petzold. It's really about Win32, not just Windows 95.<p>

Inside Visual C plus plus by David J. Kruglinksi. This book is largely MFC-oriented, but it's still cool. With MFC you can do things quickly.<p>

Inside COM by Dale Rogerson. Lots of COM info. COM is pretty central to Win32 programming. My favorite chapter is 11, which talks about IDispatch interfaces and Automation, the behind-the-scenes of the Windows scripting.<p>

Inside OLE by Kraig Brockschmidt. You might call this the Big Book of COM. (COM, OLE, what's in a name?)<p>

ActiveX Controls Inside Out by Adam Denning. More about COM, OLE, and ActiveX.
