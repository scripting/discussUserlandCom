In some sense, this isn't that different from what might be possible with Mozilla in the near future. This is why some people are labeling Mozilla as a "platform" instead of just a web browser.</i><p>

So, perhaps this is a tacit acknowledgement that integrating a web browser control into an operating system, for use in more tasks than just surfing the web, is a good idea?<p>

Or would it be too difficult for this group to say that Microsoft was rather visionary in this respect?
