The user interface allows you to add one url at a time, but please don't allow this to scare you off.  You are perfectly welcome to submit , via GET or post urls in the form:<p>

<a href="http://goxml.com/pexe/se/s_qry.cgi?URL=...&EMAIL=...&CATEGORY=...&DESCRIPTION">http://goxml.com/pexe/se/s_qry.cgi?URL=...&EMAIL=...&CATEGORY=...&DESCRIPTION</a>=...<p>

..Just make sure the values are url encoded if using GET.  I added several urls myself using a script I wrote in a couple minutes.  We will make such tools available asap for those of you with large xml collections.<p>

We also have an XML format, which would allow you to catalog your collection in XML.  If you did this using the format we specify, submitting that one page would in turn have all referenced XML pages indexed. We are currently testing it and will release the specs as soon as we are sure of its integrity.
