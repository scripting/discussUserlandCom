Not that I've put much thought into it, but off the top of my head I think all that's needed is a list element in the user's record that contains all of the message numbers that user has read.<p>

When a user reads a message, the message number is added to the list if it doesn't already exist there.<p>

I think that's how EBBS works, but I could be wrong.<p>

What else would be needed?<p>
