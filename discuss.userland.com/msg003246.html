In between servers the protocol should be push based to allow for real-time updates; end-users should be able to sort and cull messages based on poster, topic, keyword searches and such; to save on bandwidth the topology doesn't need to be a strict many-to-many; and so on...<p>

And all of a sudden it hit me that we're just talking about reimplementing NNTP, if you want to get fancy we could add the changes Elf Sternberg proposes <A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/elf/elf/projects/covenant/index.html">in his call to Balkanize Usenet</A>.<p>

Everything's a rehash.
