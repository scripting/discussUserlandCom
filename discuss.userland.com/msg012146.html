Let me explain.<p>

I think software is inherently a mixed bag. I think it's stupid for one platform to dis the others. It's stupid because it's a losing proposition, yes even for Linux. It's still true that most people don't use Linux. Given that position, it should actively welcome offers of compatibility.<p>

However, when it comes to print vs web, I think that was over a long time ago. I still do occasionally pick up a magazine at the grocery store, but it's very occasional. For me, I don't need print. Yes, I do dis pubs that print, and feel justified in that. And I have even more disdain for pubs that *only* do print. Esp ones that serve communities that can be as arrogant as the Linux folk. (Yes, I know there is no such thing as Linux, and there are no Linux folk, just like there is no IETF.)<p>

About the web, dear Zac, I am a radical. <p>

About OSes and scripting environments, I am a peacemaker.
