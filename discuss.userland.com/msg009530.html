In Win98 and Windows 2000 (as well as with IE 4 with ActiveDesktop), the explorer supports forward and back (exactly as with IE) so every navigate is effectively a push.<p>

I realize that it would be nice to have more explicit control so that by default opening a folder icon created a new explorer window but if you right click and choose "hoist" that it navigates the current window.  I'm pretty sure this could be done with a shell extension.  If I can find the time next week I'll see about doing it.<p>
