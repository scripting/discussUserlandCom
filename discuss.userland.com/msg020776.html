I found a couple of references to the keyboard on the Web.  One <A HREF="http://www.systembuilders.com/image/superwk.txt">price list</A> still contains it:<p>

<PRE>KB-IB-13H6689          IBM ADJUSTABLE KEYBD (PS PLUG)                   238.35</PRE><p>

From a mailing list post I found out that <A HREF="http://www.goldtouch.com/">Goldtouch</A> designed the IBM keyboard, and they now sell a similar keyboard of their own:<p>

<IMG SRC="http://www.tifaq.org/images/goldtouch-kb2.gif"><p>

It has several changes from the keyboard I'm using:<p>

<UL>
<LI>There's no huge adjustment knob at the split point.
<LI>The home/end/page up/down, insert and delete keys have moved from above the Backspace key to the left side of the keyboard.
<LI>There are Windows and contextual-menu keys (placed in weird positions).
<LI>The left inverted-T arrow section has been removed, but both Control and Alt keys are bigger. On my keyboard, Control and Alt are the size of letter keys, which actually isn't as much of a problem as it might seem.
<LI>There's now an embedded numeric keypad as with most laptops.
<LI>The row of keys containing the space bar is closer to the side of the keyboard.
</UL><p>

Other than that, it looks very similar to the keyboard I'm using, down to the labels on the keys.  I'd guess that the "feel" would be similar too.  It's about $120.<p>
