We actually didn't do any iCab testing, specifically, but I knew that it had CSS support, so I figured as long as I kept things simple we would be ok.<p>

Unfortunately, I'm not sure that I'm able to make the change to the font in the footer quite so easily. The font cascade wasn't chosen by me. In fact, I wanted to use Verdana as the primary font (with Geneva, Arial, Sans filling out the cascade), which reads just find at 9 pixels, on almost all monitors. I was told this was too boring, and a nice serif font like Georgia should be used. And when these suggestions come from the Office of the President, you kind of have to take them seriously... ;-><p>
