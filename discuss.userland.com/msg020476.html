Destroying choice is as bad as -- no, worse than -- being able to raise prices, and is equally actionable under antitrust law.

Let me see if we can narrow down the subject of dispute:
<p>
If the FSF could achieve a long-term <i>financial</i> benefit from the way it distributes GCC, I agree that you'd have a predatory-pricing case against it.  However, it doesn't have such a benefit.  You claim that they are engaged in predation because of the long-term <i>ideological</i> benefit -- that is, the possible elimination of non-open-source C compilers from the market.
<p>
If you think the FSF's behavior is <i>immoral</i>, that's your right, and I won't dispute it.  But what grounds do you have for saying that the FSF is acting <i>illegally</i>?  What companies in a situation similar to the FSF's, where their allegedly-predatory behavior <i>could not bring them any long-term financial gain</i>, have lost antitrust suits?
