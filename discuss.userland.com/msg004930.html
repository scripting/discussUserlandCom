This is the perennial question, we tried doing a Frontier Runtime in the early 90s, but it's impossible to draw a line that works. <p>

              We invariably become limited to using functionality that's only in the runtime. <p>

<b>              We want to build on all the functionality that's in Frontier. 
</b></i><p>

A "Linux runtime" frontier could be as simple as porting Frontier by stubbing out all the GUI calls.  Leave 'em in the code, but turn them into NOPs.<p>

I'd rather see a full GUI Frontier on Linux, but a runtime version would be great too.
