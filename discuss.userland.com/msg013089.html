And while more memory (I have 64meg) would probably help, the speed increase was very noticable, especially when I generated the whole site. BTW my bus speed is 33.2 mhz.While I was serving my site static from a WWW hosting company. I did usually leave Frontier up for long periods to compile the links I collected for my weblog. My aDSL connection was to unstable to use my system as a server except for testing.<p>
