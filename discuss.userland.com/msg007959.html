If you're interested in the actual facts, Eric Raymond's site has links to some exhaustive statistical studies showing that violent crime goes down when more people _legally_ own and carry guns, and that legal gunowners are safer overall than nonowners. <p>

You're right that owning a gun is a very serious responsibility. There are solutions. Gun safes are very secure and allow very quick access with a keypad. A lock on the trigger guard is cheap (my local sheriff's dept sells them for $5) and will at least prevent it from being fired, and can be quickly removed. <p>

Another responsibility is training, for legalities, safety, and skill (to keep you from hitting innocents). No one should buy a gun who is unwilling to invest serious time and money in practice and training.
