The director/shockwave method is interesting, what do you see...using the new multi-user capabilities to tie into a XML structure that the facilitator could create in frontier?  In other words a game that has one main player that everyone can watch, but the "game" is really the technographers output that he is creating from the meeting that he is facilitating via telephone conference call.  This seemed like a possible solution to me.
