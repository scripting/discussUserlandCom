One of the Web developers on my CNET Builder.com Web conference advisory board swears by Java servlets for server-side stuff. His primary reasons:<p>

* cross-server compatibility. When he writes a servlet, it can be deployed on IIS, JWS, Netscape, WebSTAR, or any other servlet-enabled server (and he claims to have proven this)
* speed. He says that while a servlet is slow to run the first time it loads into the server's memory, it is blazingly fast from that point.
* reliability. Biggest advantage to him. He says all he has to say to people who have been developing scripted CGI for server-side stuff is "No memory leaks" and developers flock to the servlet model.<p>

He has in fact apparently used sedrvlets on a fairly large handful of extremely high-volume Web servers and sites with nary a glimmer of a problem.
