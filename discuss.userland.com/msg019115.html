I just integrated basic QuickTime functionality (graphic, movie and sound display) into our application (MacLinkPlus Deluxe) with very little hassle - not too much code to thow up a controller with the familiar QuickTime buttons and in no time I was playing the Beach Boys as MP3s via QuickTime via MacLinkPlus. Nice. <p>

As QuickTime is enhanced the users have access to more formats and improvements without depending on our software.<p>

MacTech also recently ran a series of articles about using QuickTime.<p>

Good luck - what you are doing is coooool!<p>
