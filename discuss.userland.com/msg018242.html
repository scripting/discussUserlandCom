Would it be fair to say that you're developing a DTD or XML Schema for outlines? And that not only could XML-RPC and SOAP take advantage of this structure, but various W3C technologies could also be applied? For example, using XSLT to transform from outlines to other XML document types (XHTML etc.) would be really cool.<p>

Also, could any outlining software which understood this structure be used as an editor/reader?<p>

All of this looks like its adding up to several giant steps in the right direction.
