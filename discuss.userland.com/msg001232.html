Extensive background checks are done. Anything like adultery will exclude that person.<p>

Why is this? Because it is very easy to blackmail someone who engages in this activity.<p>

Is it so much to ask that the President of the United States be subject to the qualifications?<p>

You say:
"He was protecting himself in a situation he felt was independent of the health of the country - obviously that didn't end up being the case, but that is more the fault of the  ravinous media and the opportunistic opposition."<p>

I argue that no situation for the President is "independent of the health of the country." Suppose that this situation was never uncovered. Suppose that any foreign power did uncover it. Might give them an edge eh?<p>

Something to think about. Hope you have a good day.<p>
