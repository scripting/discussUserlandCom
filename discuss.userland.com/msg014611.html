; )<p>

as far as i know there is an egroups blocking option to reject messages from a given mail address from being posted to the group (assumed that this measure was not taken already):<p>

the egroups manager of the xml-rpc list can change the posting option for member montgomery in the members section of the manage menu to the setting "override: disallow this member to post".<p>

i hope that might help!<p>
