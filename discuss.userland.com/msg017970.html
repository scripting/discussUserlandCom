Of course this is part of the labels' justification for taking the lions share of the profits. They're the ones risking the money up front, and paying studio time, engineers, graphics people, marketers, etc.<p>

Most bands cannot come up with the money it takes to record, mix, master, and press the CD and jackets and distribute the product. That's the weakness the label can exploit. So where is all of that money going to come from? Internet distribution only (potentially) answers the distribution problem. Someone is going to have to stick their necks out and risk substantial capital to get the music recorded. Good engineers, producers and others who work on recordings 'on spec' are rare, mostly because they've gotten burned so often in the past.
