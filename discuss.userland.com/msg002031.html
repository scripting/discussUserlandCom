Not that I have any inside
information, but it appears that scripting in OS X should be
exciting, especially since it looks like Yellow Box apps will fit
into OSA quite nicely. (So the scriptable app set will include both Carbon and OpenStep apps.) Combine that with a modern OS and interoperability with the Blue Box and it's going to be easier for Mac scripting users to move to OS X than NT.
I'd say you, as a Mac scripting
provider, can view this an opportunity, not something
to get upset about.<p>

From the little I've seen from the end-user client side, scripting in Windows should, in theory,
be just as pervasive as scripting on the Mac.
My credentials: I am familiar with MacOS OSA and AppleEvents, but
I have also done plenty of real implementation with OLE Automation,
especially as it is embodied in MFC-based ActiveXs that provide scripting
interfaces (IDispatch).
Scripting within
an application, or just to one application, has been pretty well
supported since OLE Automation was introduced in OLE 2. If you drink
the MFC kool-aid, you get a reasonable amount of scripting support
as well, although the relatively new ActiveX Template classes might
be a better fit for existing applications not based on MFC.<p>

However, it was not until recently that OLE Automation got the sort
of scripting-engine-side features and places to plug in (script providers, &c.) that
MacOS OSA has had for quite a while.
For example, the lack of a script engine abstractions means that
apps in the Microsoft orbit use VBA, Lotus ones use LotusScript, and
other parties must fend for themselves or adapt yet another
party's engine.
As a result, cross-application
scripting has suffered, especially for the kind of ad hoc integration
that is so easy to do on the Mac, or, if you just want to pipe streams
around, in Unix environments. There is nothing stopping  a programmer
enabling this stuff in Windows, but it's just not in the culture of Windows. Big apps tend to support automation, and ActiveX's do, too,
but a lot of medium-sized apps and most of Windows' own utilities do
not.
