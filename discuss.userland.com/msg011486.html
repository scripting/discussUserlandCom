It doesn't feel like I've been invited into your home. Like they say on TV, "Thanks for inviting us into your home."<p>

Is this wrong? Should I wipe my feet before I visit your site? Consider from the point of view of every jerk who views your site (or "visits" it!).<p>

As for the destruction of the web if TV catches on, like the destruction of UseNet and email by spam, I think this is both true and exaggerated.
