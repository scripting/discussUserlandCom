The OS battles are over.  All this Linux talk is because people are bored of talking about Portals.  As soon as something else comes up - you won't hear about Linux anymore.  And the whole Open Bazaar thing is falling apart - as they'll all starting adding their own features to Linux to make a buck. <b>Somebody's got to pay the rent.</b> So you're watching the real-time unraveling of Open Source.<p>

The chip batles are also dead - unless you want to play Pentium II clone games with AMD.  Have you seen the spec for the new Sony Playstation - now what does Amiga think they have that would beat:
<ul>
  - 300Mhz RISC<p>

  - MPEG-2 + ACs and DTS<p>

  - Playstation compatibility<p>

  - and excuse me - Sony as a marketing partner?</ul><p>

The only bad thing about the Sony system is that:
<ul>
  - it's not bundled in a PC (hopefully they'll figure that out soon)<p>

  - it's not ubiquitous in set top boxes<p>

  - there's no TCP inside of it</ul><p>

All totally solveable problems BTW.<p>
