I found the following code at the Dynamic Drive site. However, when I apply it to any of my pages it disables the colours for the background, text & links. How can I avoid this happening?<p>

here's the code I'm using:<p>

<script>
<!--<p>

*/<p>

function fullwin()&#123;
window.open("../index.html","","fullscreen,scrollbars")
&#125;
<a href="//">//</a>-->
</script><p>

<form>
<input type="button" onClick="fullwin()" value="Open window">
</form><p>

It has also been suggested to me that I remove the <form> tags and the button between them and insert <p>

onload ="fullscreen()" <p>

into the <body> tag. When I try this, the background & text colours appear as normal. However, when I open the page it keeps on opening over and over again - in fact the screen just looks like it's flashing - and the only way to stop that is to hit Ctrl+Alt+Del. And when I do that, I get a list of 20 or 30 attempts at opening the page and I have to click on End Task for each of them in turn until I can eventually return to normal display. Obvously I don't want this to happen, I just want the page to open once in full screen with all its colours! If I try the page with the open window button again, then it opens just once as I want - but still without the colours! Any advice anyone has on this would be most welcome!
