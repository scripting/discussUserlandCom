I found out one way to see how I am presented to others -- click on my own name in the header of this message.  Raising the next gripe: there should be an edit button right there!<p>

I also didn't enter a favorite OS, but it filled in "/"...  While for other things I didn't fill in it seems to just suppress that info. (?)<p>

Finally, the information is requested in several forms.  I added several URLs to my personal statement (or whatever it's called) because I didn't know it would be asking for URL info later.  (And the question about server IP address is not very clear.  It's a different world than I'm used to for sure!)
