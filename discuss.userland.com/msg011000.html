Or, of course, you could use Server-Side Includes (SSI) to do the assembly on the server side, but still on-the-fly. I don't think the included chunks have to be from the same server. Whether or no, you could use a CGI to get them from anywhere. This would be the most compatible, as the browser would not have to do any page assembly.<p>
