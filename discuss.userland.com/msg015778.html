This is false.  Spectra has a VERY rich Syndication model built on an open source initiative: WDDX. (www.wddx.org)  It is also in use by many content partners, including Moreover.com.<p>

Spectra relies on ColdFusion for it's flexibility, which is one of the most robust web application languages around.  It's flexibility is definitely a HUGE strength.<p>

Just wanted to add my two cents.  Both products sound very good, and Frontier's price certainly beats out Spectra's. ;-)<p>

Spectra was written to compete with very high-end systems like Vignette StoryServer and BroadVision, which run in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to implement.  Since its debut, at last count 160  customers have bought Spectra, that's versus 550 customers total for Vignette.  I think they have a good chance, given their track record with ColdFusion, and given their company roadmap.<p>

I am in no way affiliated with Allaire, I've just studied these systems a lot and wanted to offer a little more info.  ;-)
