An extreme example of this is something like procfs on Linux, where if you do 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' you can see information about the processor. Exposing a mini-version of the ODB as a filesystem could be low-overhead. Think of being able to treat a .root file as a directory tree! Complete integration into the OS.<p>

I didn't go to the OS X File Systems talk at WWDC on Friday, but I'm sure it'd work the same way as Linux or FreeBSD. They mentioned getting smbfs up and running easily, which is encouraging.<p>
