The line was down 7.8% of the time.<br><br>I think I'm going to visit Conxion's office with a big pair of scissors and cut their line to the outside world. I'll reconnect it periodically so that they are only down 7.8 percent of the time. That should be OK with them, based on their lack of response to the 43 emails that Track-PacBell has already sent to Conxion, including their CEO Antonio Salerno. <br><br>Conxion makes bold claims on their website about uptime. "If we’re down for 26 seconds, our customers get one month of hosting free. Compare that to the industry standard: one day free for 15 minutes of downtime." <br><br>By either standard Conxion owes us a lot of free hosting. <i>Our line has been down for 185 minutes in the last two days.</i><br><br>BTW, Conxion chose PacBell as the T1 vendor, not UserLand, so the finger pointing is pretty ridiculous. It would be like UserLand sending its customers to Microsoft when there's a problem because we use their C compiler to build Frontier.<br><br>
