Will there be more O'Reilly stuff or will Matt's efforts be entirely on-line?  It would be a shame if printed reference material weren't part of UserLand's strategy (at least in some third party format or perhaps downloadable and printable).  Books go places where computers (at least for the time being) can't.<p>
