How difficult would it be to make a "Userland Netcenter" or a my.tembel.org?  Seems like anyone could support Netcenter channels on their own site.  Does the agreement restrict this at all?<p>

It looks like the engineers may have tricked the lawyers a bit on this one.  If the Netcenter rules are too restrictive, and other sites can compete with it directly, all of the good content will be on the other sites.  It can only be a matter of time before they're forced to relax a bit.
