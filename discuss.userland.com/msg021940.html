I'm not sleeping through it. ABC News just reported Bush's lead at about 200 votes in Florida out of not quite 6,000,000. It looks like there will be a recount for sure (required if the race is within 1,000 votes in FL if I understand corerctly). And there are still something like 30,000 uncounted out-of-country absentee ballots.<p>

It may be days...
