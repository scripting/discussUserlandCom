You won't load the same drivers, and hence won't "assemble" the same kernel at boot time, if you run a different distribution. So, yes -- the Linux kernel itself has forked.
<P>
The reason why this is done via modules is because of the particular version of the GPL under which Linux is licensed. While the vendors must share their changes to the static part of the kernel, they can fork it via loadable modules, and so they do. And they do it this way <i>specifically</i> because of the license.
