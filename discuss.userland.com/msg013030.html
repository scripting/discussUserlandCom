What do you think of <a href="http://www.bradlands.com/dww/about.html">A Day Without Weblogs?</a> <p>

I've been playing with weblog search engines this morning, came across some interesting stuff. <a href="http://www.linkwatcher.com/blogsearch.php3?query=search">Linkwatcher</a> apparently searches just the text on the weblogs, doesn't index the stories pointed to by the weblogs. Few weblogs have their own search engines, and those that do don't go deeper either. Our experimental <a href="http://newssearch.userland.com/default?m=25&s=1&q=hamsters">news search engine</a> does go two-levels deep, btw.<p>

NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/arts/online-encyclopedias.html">An Encyclopedic Mirror of What?</a> "For Britannica, though, the greatest risk may be not in technological excess, but in Internet access. If income depends on e-commerce, will emphases change to court clicks? Will as many resources be devoted to a rarely consulted scholarly entry on, say, Baroque opera as to a popular and commercially supported entry on, say, rock music?"<p>

Red Herring: <a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/1999/1113/news-transmetanew.html?id=userland">Drilling Deeper into Transmeta</a>.
