So clear up my options, I'd have to know about things, which are not self explanatory, and which I could not figure out by reading manuals...<p>

Can I make an XML-RPC call from a script in an HTML page? (preferebly VBScript, but maybe in a more platform independetn way) <p>

I want to call a Frontier script, which performs some functions in the Windows Shell when I click a certain link. The link should not chage the document.location.href value.<p>

I heard that IE5 is able to make XML-RPC calls. Is that right?<p>
