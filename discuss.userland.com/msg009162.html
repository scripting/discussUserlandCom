When you use gooey, you are immediately able to join in an existing "chat" going on for each website. Whereas with Odigo, you have to inititate a conversation with silent icons, who happen to be at the same site as you but might not want to be bothered.<p>

I think Odigo would be killer if it took on aspects of Gooey's way of chatting.
