<i>Red Hat produces a value-added Linux distribution that has features, ease-of-use, and brand recognition that sum up to a product that other distributors cannot match. That's why they're valued at $5.8 billion.</i><p>

<i>Dave's point of view is that if Third Voice catches on and is integrated into browsers, average users won't know that it can be turned off. Maybe so, but many users will realize they can turn it off and that Third Voice comments have nothing to do with the actual website. As long as Third Voice doesn't allow people to go into your servers and change things, you're safe.</i><p>

And, of course, no one's going to let Third Voice go into their servers.
