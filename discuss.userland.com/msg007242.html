<B>Origins of WBI</B>
<BR>
So around Christmas, 1995, one of us wrote the first version of WBI in about a week --- in Perl. It was quick and dirty and slow, but it did it all. It was even multithreaded. Of course, we hadn't come up with the name WBI yet, so it was called the Memory Browser, which later mutated into Personal Web Agent (PWA). This last name clung to us for many months. We went around and gave many demos, showing off history and traffic lights and other simple functions to IBM executives and others.<p>

And after much anguish, we hit on the name WBI by flipping the 
letters IBM over and having the audacity to pronounce it "webby".<p>

WBI is a product of the <A HREF="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/user.html">User System Ergonomics Research group</A> at Almaden.</br></br>
