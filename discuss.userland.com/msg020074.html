I was sure he would be. When I first used it yesterday I told Brent I hadn't been as excited by a demo since using VisiCalc for the first time in 1979. Double-clicking on a discussion group heading and seeing all those <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/usingRadioUserLandAsADGBrow.gif">cowskulls</a> made me giddy. It's the kind of experience I live for. <br><br>	I think it flustered Brent, to be the channeler of such god-like power. I said this about Bricklin and Frankston too, the Mind Of God does the work, the product designs itself, at best we get to serve Him. How do you get there, do a lot of hard work, breathe, and listen listen listen. Listen to what the product tells you. Sometimes, if you're really good at listening, you can hear it speak. Do what it says and shut up.<br><br><b>Music on the Internet, a developing story<a name="musicOnTheInternetADevelopingStory">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/24#musicOnTheInternetADevelopingStory" title="Permanent link to 'Music on the Internet, a developing story' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Now you may ask what does editing Manila sites in an outliner have to do with music on the Internet? Where do you think the fan sites are going to live? I'm already playing my music in Radio. Make the website come to me, I say.<br><br>	BTW, remember the right-click menus from Saturday? Remember the first few commands in the <a href="http://static.userland.com/images/radiodiscuss/rightClick1.gif">popup menu</a> for songs? See how they link up to community features. That's the other side of the connection. UserLand has all this great publishing, writing, organizing power. Music is the catalyst. <br><br>	So, what does the Internet add to music? <br><br>	<i>"It's the community dummy!"</i><br><br>	Yeah it's a developing story, but the theme remains constant.<br><br><b>The Next Mind Bomb<a name="theNextMindBomb">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/24#theNextMindBomb" title="Permanent link to 'The Next Mind Bomb' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I just saw a screen shot of the next Radio UserLand Mind Bomb.

Highlights. <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20059">Patrick Connors</a>, a musician who also makes software, says that you gotta pay for his presence, and that making his work palatable for non-creative people is the hardest part. <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20061">Eric Kidd</a> provides links to open source weblogs, and notes that most of the discussion is technical, not political. <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20044">Raph Levien</a>, who kind of ripped me a new asshole and then wrote a thoughtful survey of open source philosophy is the founder of <a href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a>, a famous weblog <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20065">loved by</a> many open source developers.

Gina is one of "our girls". We basically grew up in the industry together. A lot of my friends are quoted in the piece. I'm glad she's doing so well. Go go go Gina!!<br><br>	PS: I'm sure she didn't sleep with Larry Ellison to get the job.<br><br><b>Cam<a name="cam">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/24#cam" title="Permanent link to 'Cam' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20014">Cameron Barrett</a> points to three messages I posted as evidence of what a rude person I can be. It just shows what a different point of view is all about. I re-read those messages and thought it was some of the best writing I've done, because I wrote it from a place where I totally didn't care what other people thought. I told you what I think. To me that's freedom, and that's where fun comes from. Big difference. If you spend all your time trying to figure out what other people want you to say you're playing the gatekeeper game. Just be yourself, that's the best way to go.<br><br>	<img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/dogCowFarting.gif" height="32" width="84" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">An example, Cam doesn't like me to use terms like "barking, farting chihuahuas." I got a really great compliment on that from David McCusker. It strikes a note. We are all insignficant dogs that make a lot of noise (or appear to) and we smell pretty strong if you get too close. So what. If you think your shit doesn't stink, I recommend getting a second opinion.<br><br>	<i>"My opinion, we're all barking farting chihuahaus, with incredibly short lifespans occupying an insignificant part of the universe, pretending what we do is important when it has absolutely no significance."</i><br><br><b>Tolerance for flames<a name="toleranceForFlames">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/24#toleranceForFlames" title="Permanent link to 'Tolerance for flames' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Anyway I don't like people taking personal shots at other people in space that I am responsible for. Cam and others make such a big issue of this, but listen, it's not unclear or unreasonable. If you want to ream someone at a personal level, send them an email, or do it on your site. I want to be left out of that loop. However, I don't mind if people are impolite, because that's so subject to taste. Just keep it impersonal or talk about yourself and no feelings get hurt. Also, my tolerance for flames has increased. I'm learning and growing too.<br><br><b>Flames can be funny!<a name="flamesCanBeFunny">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/24#flamesCanBeFunny" title="Permanent link to 'Flames can be funny!' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www-csag.cs.uiuc.edu/individual/pakin/complaint?title=Mr.&firstname=Dave&middlename=&lastname=Winer&suffix=&gender=m&shorttype=f&pgraphs=3">Here's a flame</a> about me, and I'm pointing to it because the writer put it on <i>his own website.</i> You can never say that I don't enjoy a good flame.
