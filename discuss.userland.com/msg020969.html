(For examples of doing this with VBScript, jump to the winShell verbs.)<p>

Last time I tried this with Python was about 6 months ago, and there was a problem. I don't remember what, exactly. Since com.callScript worked well with VBScript, JScript, and PerlScript, I assumed a bug in Python's Active Scripting support. I may or may not have been right -- and if I was right, it's worth seeing if the bug has been fixed.<p>

Nevertheless, even if that works that's not as cool as being able to choose a script language for any script, and give Python full access to the odb, etc.
