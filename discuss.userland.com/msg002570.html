Distributed apps like Dictionary.com aren't too many steps away from the complexity required I think... are there plans for some relatively-malleable hooks for this type of functionality?  (Duh, if the service is respectable it'll offer XML-RPC hooks!)  I figure the very same types of hooks could be used on content as well as markup, a la syntax checking.<p>

On the workstation integration side, I've started using Alpha, and haven't spent much time with it yet, but these kinds of connections are very useful, and the more applicable to a class of functionality the better.  Imagine being able to use a group of dictionaries simultaneously, arranging the order they're applied yourself or allowing your writers to.
