That way, those of us who abhor white backgrounds and wasted space can configure our browsers to display your pages in a manner comfortable to us, whether on the PalmPilot (which I do use to read web pages sometimes) or on the desktop.<p>

Because of my preference for black backgrounds I've had several complaints about my pages, so I'm about to revamp my pages to allow this with a cookie even 'though they're not "dynamically served" (just setting them up as Apache shtml pages).<p>
