I think that 2600 had hoped to use this case to build a way for DMCA to be overthrown by the courts. Instead this Judge soley interpreted the case based on the wording of the DMCA without considering the basis of the DMCA itself. The Sony case and its definition of fair use is the primary conflict between the courts and the DMCA, but this Judge felt that congress had debated the issue and passed a law that basically overturned the Sony case.<p>
