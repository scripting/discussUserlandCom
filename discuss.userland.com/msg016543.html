<b>I want an adult forum</b><p>

After years of shaking this out, putting up with selfish behavior of a few that stops intelligent thoughtful discussion by the people who are regulars here, I believe we have found the formula that will allow us to go the "last mile" in gaining the <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/09/14/adultTalk">adult discussion</a> forum that I want. <p>

<b>A no-flame guarantee</b><p>

The instant a discussion gets disrespectful or personal I will turn off the discussion group. I'll generally let it go for two or three deletions, if that is necessary (I hope it isn't) but after that I will opt-out on being the host, and I will turn this server off.<p>

<b>Free site hosting</b><p>

If this isn't what you want, UserLand offers <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/iWantOne">free site hosting</a>, so go give it a try and create your own community with your own values.<p>

<b>Email</b><p>

Any email you send me is on the record and attributable. Don't make threats if you don't want them public with your name on it. It's better just to post it on a Web site (not here) and send me a pointer, that way if you change your mind later, when it might not seem as important, you'll be able to adjust your statement.<p>

<b>My ask-not policy</b><p>

If you want, you may adopt this policy for your discussion group,  or you may modify it to suit your purposes, with or without attribution. <p>

"Ask not what the Internet can do for <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/asknot.gif">you</a>.."<p>

Peace.<p>
