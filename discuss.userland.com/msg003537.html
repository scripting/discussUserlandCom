There's nothing magical or mysterious about some Trinity blah blah blah.<p>

1.  First you need to encode video - off the shelf<p>

2.  Then you need to store it - ever heard of a hard drive before?<p>

3.  Then you need to have a Content Mngt system to store all the various versions of teh video - so that you can serve up a 'scalable' site - different strokes for different folks.<p>

4.  There are some 'real-time' features that they talk about - and I'm sure you know about streaming servers - and what it takes to multi-cast or otherwise get that video out there.<p>

All off the shelf knowledge.  Trinity is as much a system integrator than anything else.<p>

Yah sure they calim they have custom this, and special that - but I've hired marketing people before - and I can read between the lines.  They're an integrator.<p>

So go for it!  I'd like reports from the Frat parties on campus please - especially of 'who's sleeping with who'?
