I installed the script and configured it.  It went off with hardly a hitch, and when I'm local to my servers tommorrow, I will install it so that it runs properly.  One question though.  This script is really designed for a single domain, single directory or generated from ODB site.  What would be the easiest way to have the script generate 17 different siteChanges.xml files for the 17 different domains/directories?
