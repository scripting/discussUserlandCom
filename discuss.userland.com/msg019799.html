To Linux people tuning in, the Finder was not that deeply integrated in the OS. I wrote my own Finder in the mid-late 80s, and you didn't need any special hooks to do it. It was an app. I know it knew a *little* more about the OS than apps did, but I don't remeber what. <p>

Also I just remembered that one of the members of the System 7 team is at Eazel too. I actually worked with him a bit on Apple Events in the Finder in the early 90s, but now I can't remember his name!!<p>
