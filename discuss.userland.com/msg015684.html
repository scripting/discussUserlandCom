Say I have an online testing system. For students in a computer lab I want the test questions to be displayed in a random order on the page to help prevent cheating--even if a student looks at his neighbor's computer screen, it would be different. Then, I would need to sort the questions back into proper order for displaying the results.<p>

And is there also a easy way to sort items in a list?
