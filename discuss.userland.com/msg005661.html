plus..<p>

1. user-selected style sheet, sort of like picking your wallpaper or desktop theme. Some styles would offer larger fonts, other smaller ones.<p>

2. (mentioned before) some kind of pithy description of what the news service is about in the "pick your news services" page. I thought camworld was a site dedicated to web-cams. Wrongo!<p>

3. modules to parse other, non-RDF syndicated news formats. Let's open up the gates to more infosources.<p>

4. option to have latest entries in a DG (does not mean Data General, but Discussion Group) as a info source box<p>

5. some sort of elegantly simple structure-viewer which could be a one coumn module, showing a summary of available content at my.userland. Maybe an outliner like Frontier has?<p>

6. why not have the option to put a calendar as a box in my.userland?
for that matter, why not any basic desktop widget like a calculator, video window, etc. <p>

7. going nuts here, let the user type in a URL that my.userland will monitor and build a list of stories for. <p>

8. one of the boxes I'd like to be able to display as an info source would be all additions to my.userland's news sources.<p>

9. a info source with a random quote for the day<p>

10. prioritize news by position or style which matches a synonym-based keyword or topic the user selects
