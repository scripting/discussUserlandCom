Your comments about different demographics desiring different "styles" are on target. The problem with Dvorak's piece, apart from its sexist stereotypes, is it presumes to criticize Apple for failing to market the iBook specifically to those who share Dvorak's sensibilities with respect to style. As if his was the only demographic that mattered. One of the problems with computers is that they've been designed and marketed only to the Dvorak's of the world for too long, which goes a long way to explain the success of the iMac and it's disdain among the technoscenti a la Mr. Gates and his disparaging comments regarding Apple's lead in "color."<p>

On the MacLawyer mailing list, there is a great deal of the same sentiment, that many of these "mature" men wouldn't wish to use a device that doesn't convey the "seriousness" of their profession. Fine with me. Don't buy one, a Powerbook looks plenty serious to me.<p>

I think Apple is to be commended once again for bringing color and style to the computer form factor. The iBook is intended for young people and people who appreciate a little color and shape and texture in their tools. It's not a product for "everyone." <p>

I didn't like Dvorak's piece, but it wasn't simply for the sexism.<p>
