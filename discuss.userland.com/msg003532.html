There are Windows-lookalike GUIs for Linux. <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> is pretty good about this, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> tries to be different. And <a href="http://www.stardivision.com/">StarOffice</a> does an almost too-good job of emulating Windows and Office's look and feel.<p>

Personally there's stuff I like about all three GUIs. I like the way in Linux/X you can point at a window and not bring it to the front; copy and paste with the mouse; the way you can choose where to place a window as it opens, or have it automatically place so the windows tile on your screen. On Windows I like the way it's easy to tile applications on the desktop, or expand a window to the full size of the screen. On the Mac I like a lot of stuff, probably more than the other two, but probably my biggest complaint is having to move/resize/move/resize windows 8 million times before I get them right.<p>

So conformance can be a good thing, but it's hard to innovate that way. If Linux just picks up Microsoft's GUI verbatim then your average user may not see a reason to switch. If it picks one, or a few, consistent GUI standards and associated toolkits as seems to be happening with GNOME, that's a good thing.<p>
