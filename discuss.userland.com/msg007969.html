My.UserLand.Com is now a writing environment. Check out our new <a href="http://my.userland.com/weblog/">Weblog Editor</a>. If you find great links, share them with us. It's never been easier to get your ideas on the web. <i>UserLand.Com membership required.</i><p>

Here's the <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$977">channel</a> I've been working on to test this stuff out. Hey, I like this tool. I like it better than what I'm using to edit Scripting News. This is, by the way, mass market stuff. <i>It's easy.</i><p>

What is <a href="http://www.desktop.com/">desktop.com</a>?<p>

<a href="http://www.emailjournal.com/jdescr.html">EmailJournal.Com</a> is a Frontier site.<p>

<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/ask_tim/">Tim O'Reilly answers</a> a reader's question about component technologies for Linux. XML-RPC gets a mention.<p>

Wired: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/20473.html">NetoMat, the Non-Linear Browser</a>. A perfect match for the content flow that's building on My.UserLand.Com!<p>

Here's a <a href="http://www.nocrybabies.com/">domain</a> I wish I had thought of grabbing. <i>No doubt someone will complain about this.</i><p>

New directions for My.UserLand.Com. We've <a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$50">de-emphasized</a>, for now, the Choose Your News and Favorites pages on My.UserLand.Com. They're still there, you can still use them, and we will preserve the functionality as we go forward.<p>

Next, I think very few people are aware that we're doing static rendering of channels as they change. For example, here's the <a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/myUserLand/staticRendering/service00747.html">static rendering</a> for Scripting News. So, if you want, you can write your own page, running on your own server, that selects the channels you like, and arrange them any way you want. You don't have to like the way we do it, you can create your own interface if you have a moderately powerful server scripting environment. (This is Scripting News, after all.)<p>

Next, we provide the full uptodate <a href="http://my.userland.com/xml/servicelist.xml">service list</a> in XML. So, if you don't like the way we render channels, write your own channel renderer. Open it to the public. I think it would be fun to get aggregators running in <i>every scripting environment.</i><p>

Now, looking at the service list, I can see room for improvement! Why is no one making suggestions there?<p>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/06/biztech/articles/30pop.html">NY Times</a>: "How can the record establishment make money by selling music for digital download online? The challenge might not be so difficult if a healthy music trade were not already in place in the form of unprotected MP3 files, the digital audio compression format that can easily be copied and distributed illegally."
