IMO, a couple of things need to happen to drive more acceptance of micropayments. People need to realize that advertising is not going go support a profitable business model. Stratospheric stock valuations need to come down, in line with the realization that many e-business ventures may never make money, let alone the kind of money required to justify their market caps. <p>

This order of events--realization that advertising won't foot the bill triggering a decline in stock prices--seems most likely, but I think it could go the other way, as well. If the economy goes into recession and the overall stock market plunges, it will take down e-oriented stocks with it, leading to re-evaluation of business models and rejection of advertising-only as viable model for most sites. Then, slowly, micropayments would take hold.<p>

The way I look at it, to a large extent the suckers buying e-stocks at vastly inflated prices are subsidizing my Internet experience. Right now everything is free--enjoy it while it lasts. Although of course in the *long* run, e-services based on a more solid, profit-based model should deliver superior consumer benefits.
