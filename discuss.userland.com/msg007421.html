I guess that's in line with Manila; being able to Edit This Page anywhere, you need a better editor.<p>

I recently discovered the designMode property of IFRAME in IE5. It actually isn't that bad! It understands draganddrop, you can paste an URL and have it automatically become a link, etc. I think it could stand an analogue of the Hotmail-test (use Hotmail for all your email for a week).<p>

So, anyway, I put up a demo at <a href="http://cajal.mbb.ki.se/staff/sten">http://cajal.mbb.ki.se/staff/sten</a>. IE5 absolutely required. Try this: go to wired news, ctrl-A, ctrl-C, then click on the editor, ctrl-V. It's pretty cool, no? Try the printing, too.<p>

Does anybody know if the designMode property is standard in any way? Will Gecko support it? They have their own editor, so it shouldn't be too difficult.<p>
