service, I have enjoyed the fruits of a "broadband" way of 
thinking.  While the Mail to the Future/BroadBand effort is very 
sexy - it is more sizzle than substance - sort of like iMacs in 
different colors.  Who cares what the background of the email 
looks like.  It tends to obscure and trivialize the beauty and power of the plumbing 
underneath.  Like Pointcast -  its fun for the first few days but 
then you get sick of it and want the info fast and concise.  
Similarly the discussion group are cool for organization, 
threading, and collaboration.  However the navigation is a 
disaster - ever try to read an entire thread including all branches - 
it is great going downstream but returning upstream is a real 
bitch. <p>

The beauty of broadband is not to have a pretty background 
for the messages but to allow the user to download the entire 
discussion group thread with all its subthreads at once - even a 
long thread couldn't be more than 60 - 100 K - 5 - 10 seconds to 
download at most at ethernet speeds.  Then a navigation method 
through the thread could allow you to instantly move from one 
part of the message to another up or down, right or left.  Cable 
modems are fast once you get them going, but the latency - the 
time until you first start getting back information often isn't that much faster than standard modems  
so having to hit the server for each message is both tedious and time consuming.  <p>

Unfortunately in my experience most people (non computer professionals) are 
really terrified at using a computer and I've found it hard to get 
them to use anything but email for communication. I 
built an "extranet" for my company (11 physicians, 4 managers) 
and despite providing cool threaded discussion pages, people won't use them.  I 
think this is why products such as Lotus notes are so popular.  
Once Frontier 6 is released my personal goal it to marry the email 
services of the content server to the message organization of the 
discussion groups and then serve up entire threads at a time over 
over HTTP with some wizzy way in the browser to navigate 
back and forth through the discussion threads.  That's my kind 
of broadband nirvana.  <p>
