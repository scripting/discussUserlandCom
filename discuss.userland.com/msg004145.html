In less than half an hour, I had created a Netscape Channel for CamWorld. And, yes, it took me just as long to create a simple XML file for NewsSearch to index.<p>

What I failed to understand the first time I looked at Userland's specs was that you don't need any special app to output a correctly-formatted XML file. You can use BBEdit, or any text-editor for that matter.<p>

It'd be nice for a standard to emerge. I'd hate to see Userland and Netscape start undermining each other's work because of disagreements about how a format should work.<p>

I can't wait to see who else is building XML-compatible files of their sites.<p>
