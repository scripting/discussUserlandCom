hmm.  has Microsoft sued anyone for implementing style
sheets?  have they successfully used this patent to force
any of their competitors to deliver inferior products?
what have I missed?<p>

or do you mean that you're offended by the fact that companies
can own patents, and not over how certain companies abuse their
patents?<p>

(btw, has Microsoft *ever* used patents to block their
competition?  they have been sued a few times themselves,
but have they ever sued anyone else?)<p>
