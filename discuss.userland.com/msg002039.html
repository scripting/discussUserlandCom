And maybe Apple will figure it out at some meaningful level and let us help them be stronger in this area. For example, I doubt if they're aware of menu sharing and what an incredible advantage it gives the Mac platform. <p>

Have you seen the Xerox commercial where the woman is quitting a company and the angel says "Oh all the information that's walking out the door!" That's what's been going on at Apple for years, many generations of that happening.<p>

Anyway, I think one of the reasons Hess got the job in the DNA group at Microsoft is to try to flatten out the scripting APIs and build bridges between the different cultures, and we're happy to help with that because it will only make our software more valuable.
