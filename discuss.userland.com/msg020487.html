With all due respect to the open source developers, none of them have created the kind of software we have. Perhaps when that happens we'll have a meaningful A-B comparison. But if they just clone our software, it's not meaningful, because there will be a key process that they have not come up with, the process of invention, which imho is not well understood or respected in the open source world.</i></blockquote><p>

You've said this before, and several examples (out of many more) were provided.  What results are you looking for?  The ratio of invention to cloning seems no different to me in the commercial world than in the open source world.
