This is very exciting, thank you.<p>

Being a 5.01 user thinking about purchasing the 5.1 upgrade, I have two quick questions:  {These are just for curiousity, no nagging intended at all.}<p>

1.  Do you know when you plan on releasing v6.0?<p>

2.  How's Frontier as a COM client coming along? Can you wet our appetites? I'm not a programmer per se, I'm just envious of my MAC peers. :)<p>

As always, thanks for a great product!
