He suggests that the publishing component of Zope could recognize 
an XML-RPC request and handle it.  In other words, the server 
could handle both mysite.com/object/method?parameter=1&otherparameter=name
as it does now, or an HTTP POST operation to 
mysite.com/object/method, with the parameters marshalled as XML.
But you wouldn't want this to misfire if someone uploads an XML file to a method, in which case you're doing a POST and the type is text/xml, but it's not actually an XML-RPC operation.<p>

I don't think it's correct to say that the type should be text/xml just because the body is in an XML-based format.  It's in a specific format, not any random DTD.  Web servers may serve up MathML, PGML, and SMIL files, yet they shouldn't all be indicated as text/xml.
