That just doesn't add up, Dori. If people know you only from online there's no way they can assume that you're a woman. Until I read your v8 rant (;-) I didn't even know (or care) that you're a woman. Dori happens to be a perfectly good gender-neutral name. I get the "have you plugged in your computer" response all the time and with my name there's very little possibility of mistaking me for a clueless woman. A clueless person, maybe, but that's another story.<p>

:-) yours, Jacob
