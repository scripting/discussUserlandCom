The software publishing industry rests on its ability to provide applications that do "everything you could want" within a certain domain. New versions mean, generally, new features - most of which we'll never use.<p>

To completely accept scripting would imply a shift of viewpoint on their part - from seeing their applications as complete entities to seeing them as collections of user accessible procedures tied together by a user interface. <p>

Is that likely to happen? <p>
