For me it's more random, sometime the list comes, sometimes not, when I connect from home over a modem.<p>

Connecting from work, on a fast line, it's rare to not get the full list.<p>

This kind of problems was reported a lot when the connections to Userland was disturbed by massive IE5 downloads on the same leg of the net.<p>

Seams like the Frontier server times out, or in some other way loses interest, when a page request takes to long to finish.
