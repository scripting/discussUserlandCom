I am a lonog time frontier user, but have not dug into Frontier 6 yet.  <p>

Currently I am also evaluating Cold Fusion as an app server.<p>

I have two questions about frontier 6.<p>

1. How well will it handle millions of registered users?
2. How stable is the Tallent ODBC driver? (Our site will still require a high end RDBMS behind the app server)<p>

Anyone who has used Frontier in a high availability/scalability situation and can provide some insight would be much appreciated.<p>

Mike
