  This might be my last post in this DG<p>

  First of all, I would like to thank you for everything that you have taught me through Scripting.com , UserLand.com etc.<p>

  I am just guessing that you are not in your best moods in the last few days and probably there are countless other reasons for your reactions to this thread. I am also very surprised at your reactions. The words seem to be coming out from an entirely different person!<p>

  Like Aaron, I would like it very much if the threads here are sent to me via email so that I only look at the interesting ones and participate in them.<p>

  Since this doesnot seem to be your liking, I will just look forward to reading Scripting News and continue to maintain my weblog.<p>

  Thanks once again<p>

  Good Day<p>

Thanks for listening, Kishore.
