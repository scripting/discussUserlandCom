The META tags have to be done for each page and it really can't be scripted while a single file created would just be a script done every night.  That seems much easier to me.<p>

The other question would be how can you do this for dynamic sites.  Could a siteChanges.xml be created for something like nirvana that could be created differently each time the page is loaded?<p>

Just some thoughts.<p>
