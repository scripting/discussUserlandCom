It takes a command-line param, the full path to a .exe file.<p>

On launch, it launches the app specified on its command line.<p>

Then it loops, making sure the app is running, if it's not it launches it.<p>

With this app I could quit Frontier every night at midnight, and start over. I want to do this, it feels right. <p>
