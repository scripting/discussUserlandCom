There are individual cases of people with disabilities suing particular organisations over website access issues. In these cases, the onus is on the plaintiff to demonstrate why they have a <I>need</I> to access that information. Therefore I consider it extremely unlikely that Joe Coder is going to get sued over his Fave Links page on Geocities. The Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't apply to your home.<p>

Most mainstream-media articles on this topic aren't very helpful in explaining the problem or its solution. There's no value in generating a fear of impending litigation-frenzy.<p>
