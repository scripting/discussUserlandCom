All I've read until now is" We have to push MS to do this and this and...". Why? So MSIE is the ONLY browser to implement these features? I guess that the right thing to do is to push W3C to define a new standard either in HTML or CSS (<textarea style="mode: html;"> ?) so all the browser vendors can implement it into a standard way.<p>

While I like MSIE a lot, I recognize that's not the only browser around and proposing alternatives like ActiveX or Java is not the solution. HTML and the likes are <i>output</i> methods, and the textarea field is just that: <b>text</b>.
