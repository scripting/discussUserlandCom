But this is not the only competitor.<p>

I'd be interested to know more about the following questions:<p>

- As Content Management People using Frontier, who are our competitors (like Imperia, StoryServer, LinoPress, etc.)?<p>

- What features do they deliver?<p>

- Is there a common sense about the features an editorial system should have? Which are they?<p>

- As I see it, flexibility is *the* big plus for Frontier. We do the things no 'out of the box' solution will provide. Any other?<p>

I think this could be an interesting discussion, helping us to know the market we're in and perhaps shaping a kind of perceivable "product identity" for ourselves and our customers.
