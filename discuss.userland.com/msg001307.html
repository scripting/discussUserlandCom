"Again, it's about sexual violence, one step short of rape. And it happened on the job, probably many times, in the workplace we collectively own, the White House."<p>

That's bullshit. The whole issue that has brought Clinton to the brink of impeachment (and perhaps beyond) is a consensual sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. That's a far cry from sexual harrasment, much less rape. Such comparisons should be deeply offensive to victims of actual rape and sexual violence.<p>

Clinton may have a sexual problem - that's up to him and the people close to him. But there's not a shred of evidence that he has a problem with sexual violence. What leads you to such a conclusion? Does it reveal more about your own attitudes towards sex?<p>

Instead of declining to answer personal questions in public, as he should have, he lied about them. That is his "crime". I would prefer to impeach Presidents who have committed mass murder or criminal acts with real consequences.<p>

Yep this country is fucked up alright - the current episode is proof enough of that.<p>
