Will there be a way to implement this editing system for static sites that are rendered to remote servers or to shared file systems? For instance, could the content team browse and edit the pages on an NT box running Frontier at something like http://publish.mysite.edu/ and have a button on the page that said "publish" or "submit" which would trigger a traditional rendering from the values stored in #ftpsite and send the page to a unix box at http://www.mysite.edu/?<p>
