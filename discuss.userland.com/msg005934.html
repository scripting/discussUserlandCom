You can use a variety of different processors (ARM, Hitachi, Motorolla PPC, etc.) This is a BIG plus from an embedded system view. The Intel x86 line doesn't fit very well into an embedded system without a lot of supporting logic around it that takes up space and costs a lot. <br>
<br>
Remember, in an embedded system (like a STB), the cost is the most important issue.</br></br>
