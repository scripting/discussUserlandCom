That's fairly handy!  On the flip side, it's not quite so easy to take the string "Thu, 08 Jul 1999 07:00:00 GMT" and determine how many hours have passed since that moment...<p>

I believe that it is somewhat easier to produce such a string from seconds since the epoch than it is to go the other way around.<p>

However, as I mentioned, I'm more than willing to hear how Windows and the Mac do this.  Let's make the decision based on the merits, not based on the OS, huh? I only mentioned that I was inspired by UNIX because I wanted to be open about my influences, not because I think that it must be correct because it's the UNIX way.
