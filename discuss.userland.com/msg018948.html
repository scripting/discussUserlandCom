We're actively working on a software product, and if there's anyone who would like to pitch in on the site, even on a short-term basis, the help would be appreciated. I think it's important to broaden its scope, and I'm not caught up or even keeping up.<p>

Basically the help I'm looking for is someone to keep their eye out for Napster-related stories on the Web, and post them, or send them to me via email. I don't mind updating the site, it's easy enough, it's just I'm mssing some important stuff like Napigator. There must be other things I'm missing. People are always asking what I think of Gnutella. What should I tell them? I'm so busy with this new product, I'm surely missing important stuff.<p>

That's the kind of help I'm looking for, eyes scouting for new developments. With things happening so fast now, one person can't do it.
