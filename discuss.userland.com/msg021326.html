He seems a smart guy from what I've seen in his 
explanation of why side effects from an HTTP Get
operation are a bad idea.  I like this much math savvy.
Anyway, I have no intention to make him sound stupid.)<p>

Here's a radical reduction of the XML Protocol Charter
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/XML-Protocol-Charter.html">http://www.w3.org/2000/09/XML-Protocol-Charter.html</a>)
to a ridiculously threadbare set of terms.  Since this
reduction is on a section by section basis, it tends
to lose all context from interconnections in the text.
I aim to keep a hundredth part of the original, but it's
hard to cut that much.<p>

This reduction only intends to be interesting, and to
stimulate thought after seeing how inadequately this
brief version actually represents the whole charter.
This kind of approach can be useful, but sometimes is not.
The trick is to avoid losing something crucial in the
extreme paring away of extra detail.<p>

1. Scope<p>

Value: Inter agent comms enhance web apps.<p>

Focus: sync and async XML over existing transports.<p>

Parts: envelope, conventions, serialization, HTTP<p>

Goals: agnostic, simple, modular, extensible<p>

1.1 Simplicity<p>

Simplicity is big but relative. Modularity and layering help.<p>

Less is more, but compatibility will impact simplicity.<p>

1.2 Evolvability<p>

Orthogonal extension is tricky.<p>

1.3 Intermediaries<p>

Language must support composition.<p>

1.4 Representation<p>

Other models besides XML and RDF need
serialization without penalty.  They change, so 
orthogonality must be maximized for freedom.<p>

2. Out of Scope<p>

"XML Protocol" is too broad, so we downplay some things. <p>

2.1 Binary Data<p>

Ignore binary format languages.<p>

2.2 Compression<p>

Size is no priority.<p>

2.3 Transport<p>

Ignore (new?) transports scaling better than HTTP.<p>

2.4 Apps<p>

Avoid app semantic targets.<p>

2.5 Metadata<p>

Metainfo looks like other content and is not privileged.<p>

3. Schedule<p>

One or two month sized steps.<p>

4. Relations<p>

Internal: coordinate with XML, RDF, and HTTP work.<p>

External: return calls from IETF, ebXML, and RosettaNet.<p>

5. Members<p>

Official inhouse nominees and chair invited experts.<p>

5.1 Email<p>

Mailing list.<p>

5.2 Web<p>

Public home page.<p>

5.4 Flesh<p>

Closed door.<p>

5.5 Resources<p>

Dirty dozen.<p>

5.6 W3C<p>

Loaner.<p>

5.7 IP<p>

Share dammit.
