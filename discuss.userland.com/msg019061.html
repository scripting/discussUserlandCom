begs for a brief reality check.  At our stations we use software called the Scott System (<a href="http://www.scottstudios.com/">Scott Studios</a>, Dallas), the heart of which is a full-color, touch-screen application which does all the things you describe, plus instantly sorts up to 10,000 songs, commercials, jingles, etc. by artist, title, length, date, or other customizable criteria.<p><p>

To be sure, it's not intended for the common user, but it is a joy to behold, and it never, ever crashes.  (did I mention it runs under DOS? and weighs only 750K?  Now <b>that's</b> some tight code...)
