There are currently two open source ways:<p>

Willows TWIN (<a href="http://www.willows.com"><a href="http://www.willows.com">http://www.willows.com</a></a>) is a library which used to be commercial, but has since been LGPL'd (meaning: put under the GNU Library GPL license. Which DO allows commercial programs linking to it and not distributing the source)<p>

Then there's the old stalwart WINE (<a href="http://www.winehq.org"><a href="http://www.winehq.org">http://www.winehq.org</a></a>), which uses a library (winelib) and a binary loader to run Windows programs under Linux. winelib can be used to compile a native Linux program from the Windows C/C++ source. It is under a BSD-like license, which is a bit more lenient than (L)GPL.<p>

An interesting new idea is the Codeweavers' TWINE project (<A href="http://www.codeweavers.com/twine/"><a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/twine/">http://www.codeweavers.com/twine/</a></A>) which means to blend both projects, taking each one's strengths. TWINE is LGPL'd.<p>

TWINE has some interesting tools, like scripts to build Linux-native MFC libraries, and overall helping to port projects.<p>

So, anybody interested in assessing the possibility?
