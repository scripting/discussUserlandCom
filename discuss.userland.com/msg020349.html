It was all extra and out of the way also, so it never once got in my way. <p>

Does your Windows text editor come with a Medical dictionary for spell checking?  How about a Dutch?  Do I ever need a Dutch dictionary, probably not, but the penis extending feeling of having a Dutch dictionary at your fingertips cannot be denied.  <p>

And full grep searching from a spiffy interface(I know others have full grep, but they don't have a spiffy interface).  The Plugins are glorious, the HTML helper functions are divine, and the whole thing integrates with all those kick-ass APIs that Apple seems to forget they have.  <p>

I could also expound for hours on the beauty of Monaco 9pt as my monospaced font of choice(Not a BBEdit thing, but I seriously am looking into buying an iMac JUST so I can have Monaco 9pt and play Ambrosia shareware games)...<p>

I can't even look at a Mac these days because it hurts me too much when I have to go back to Windows.  Anarchie, NCSA Telnet, BBEdit, NetPresenz, Stuffit, Escape Velocity(Game), AppleScript, and an 10 year old version of Hypercard are the things I miss most about the Mac.  
From text editors to nostalgia, I'm getting all misty-eyed.
