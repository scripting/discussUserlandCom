You hit the nail on the head! The best liar always wins. I have not voted for either a Republican or a Democrat in the presedential elections since 1984 because I don't think that they are telling me the truth. I fully know that the Independent that I do vote for will lose, but my vote says that I'm tired of being lied to.<p>

As for Clinton, I'm not for or against impeachment. The thing that I would like to see happen is for our elected officials to understand that all we want is honesty. We know you'll make mistakes and do things that you shouldn't have. We understand that. Your human. But please don't lie to us and do things behind our back.<p>

The candidate that will make the tough decisions that are good for all the people, and not worry about what his party or big business or the lobbying groups want, will get my vote.
