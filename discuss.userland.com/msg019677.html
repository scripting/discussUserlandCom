I don't know why it didn't work, but I have a theory. I'm a product of genetic evolution. For whatever reason my programming is constantly generating alerts when yellowjackets are buzzing around various parts of my body. There must be a huge body chemistry reaction of fear in my blood and nervous system. Fight or flight is triggered. "This is not a safe place" all my sense say. So while at a conscious level, like you, I know that they can't do me any harm, my body says something totally opposite. Hope this helps.
