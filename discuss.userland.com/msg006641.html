This message, from May 10 1996 is from a person discussing load-balancing issues with WebObjects.<p>

According to the ZDNet article, InfoSpinner filed for a patent in April 1996.<p>

On March 26, 1996, NeXT announced that they had begun shipping WebObjects 1.0, which included the load-balancing feature.<p>

Quote from the message:<p>

<I>
WebObjects also enables corporations to scale and manage their websites.  Webmasters simply plug in additional resources without having to take their machines and applications off line-this is critical for corporations experiencing "grid lock" on their site due to increased traffic.  WebObjects facilitates this by managing incoming HTTP requests and distributing web application processes across multiple machines.</I><p>

That tells me that there's prior art and InfoSpinner's patent is useless.<p>

(Phew!)<p>
