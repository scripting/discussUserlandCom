<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/ask_tim/amazon_patent.html">Tim O'Reilly</a>: "A patent on something like '1-Click ordering' is a slap in the face of Tim Berners-Lee and all of the other pioneers who created the opportunity that Amazon has done such a good job of exploiting. Amazon wouldn't have existed without the generosity of people like Tim, who made legitimate, far-reaching inventions, and put them out into the public domain for all to build upon."<p>

Tim Bray: "Just move your web servers and corporate structure across the border. We're friendly up here in Canada and whereas the border is quite porous (both ways) to drugs and criminals and pollution, it's a remarkably effective firewall against some aspects of legal silliness.  Also we have lots of good computer programmers up here." <i>Thanks Tim!</i><p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$15317">Lawrence Lee</a> checked this out and found that Amazon had filed and received three patents in Canada.<p>

MSNBC: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/375396.asp">Tech titans talk but offer few tidbits</a>: "I own about 100 shares of Amazon.com, and I wonder if you can tell me what it is exactly that I own," asked one young woman of Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. Bezos maintained that she owned a piece of the future. <i>Yeah, our future!</i><p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$15304">Something positive</a> people can do about patents. Create an intellectual property database like IBM's that documents <i>unpatented</i> prior art, so that lawyers defending against patent suits will be as well-armed as those on the other side.<p>

On Saturday we released the <a href="http://plugins.userland.com/">plug-in architecture</a> for Manila. They're like filters for PhotoShop or Quark XTensions. Now Frontier developers can add modules to Manila to make it do things we never intended it to do.<p>

<a href="http://jake.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$154">Jake Savin</a> participated in the chat for the MSNBC Summit which he says was mostly PR for the companies. They asked Jeff Bezos about patents, he denied having a patent on 1-Click, and wouldn't comment further because it's in litigation. OK. All the more reason to boycott Amazon.<p>

Brent's mom, <a href="http://www.inessential.com/mjdavis/">Maggie Davis</a> now has her own Manila site. She's an engineer at Boeing in Seattle, <a href="http://www.inessential.com/mjdavis/stories/storyReader$4">skilled</a> in XML (!) and looking for a job. (They're on strike at Boeing.)<p>

"Not very far from me is the Arboretum, where, for under 50 bucks per year, I'm a member and can come and go and wander the grounds as I like (well, during Open Hours). 50 bucks per year is a small amount to pay for all that water and all those gardeners and all the property taxes!" <i>Smart. Why buy when you can rent so cheap?</i><p>

We can speak the truth thru this medium. We can teach each other and learn from each other. We can make new friends.
