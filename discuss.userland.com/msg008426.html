Not necessarily!<p>

What about weblogs that represent the efforts of many
people, such as <A HREF="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.memepool.com/">Memepool</A>?  Sure,
they have software mechanisms for letting multiple people
contribute (and edit) the log contents, but traditional
web logs do the same - how much of scripting.com comes
from cool stuff that you got in your inbox?<p>

How about:<p>

<I>A weblog is a new kind of website that's become popular
and is easy to create and update.  A weblog links to other
websites, it's a collection of links and information snippets,
updated frequently, often several times a day, that represents
the interest of a person or group of people.  It's a neat way
to share what you learn with other people who like to use the
web and have similar interests to you.</I>
