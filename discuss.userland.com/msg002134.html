A few things that struck me while hacking on xmlrpclib.py.  To be answered when and if anyone finds the time...<p>

1. Is "boolean" a distinct data type, or can boolean values be
interchanged with integers (e.g. zero=false, non-zero=true)?<p>

2. What is the legal syntax (and range) for integers?  How to deal with leading zeros?  Is a leading plus sign allowed?  How to deal with whitespace?<p>

3. What is the legal syntax (and range) for floating point values
(doubles)?  How is the exponent represented?  How to deal with
whitespace?  Can infinity and "not a number" be represented?<p>

4. What characters are allowed in strings?  Non-printable
characters?  Null characters?  Can a "string" be used to hold an
arbitrary chunk of binary data?<p>

5. Does the "struct" element keep the order of keys.  Or in other
words, is the struct "foo=1, bar=2" equivalent to "bar=2, foo=1" or
not?<p>

6. Can the "fault" struct contain other members than faultCode and
faultString?  Is there a global list of faultCodes? (so they
can be mapped to distinct exceptions for languages like Python and
Java)?<p>

7. What timezone should be assumed for the dateTime.iso8601 type?
UTC?  localtime?<p>

(that's all for now)
