Business-wise they're killing off any competition, that's what I meant by "early battles going their way". Once they clear the playing field of competitors, who'se going to oppose their attempt to charge you and me again for music you've already paid for? Yes, copy protection is stupid, yes, guilt trips are stupid, yes, deriding and reviling your customers and making them feel as if they're doing things that are illegal is stupid. We're not disagreeing on that.<p>

But... in the meantime I don't see a viable business coming out of all of this. That's the question that started all of this discussion. Where is the mega-bucks band that only distributes songs over the net? Where is the obscure band that became famous because of the net? Where is the artist or recording studio that got rich because of the net?<p>

So: <i>Where are the success stories?</i> So far AFAIK there are none. That's why I think the battle is being won -- currently -- by RIAA members. Long term, yeah, the users will probably win, unless we're total sheep. What shape that win will take, noone knows. My personal guess: change will be incremental, instead of paying sixteen bucks for a CD, you'll pay $1.60 for a couple of songs bundled together. Money will still go to the big five instead of artists. There'll be a few artists that make it big on their own then turn into the sixth member of the big five. Maybe I'm an ingrained pessimist.. :)
