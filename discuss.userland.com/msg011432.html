Exactly. Frontier already runs reasonably well in the WINE libraries. Microsoft could make it run perfectly. And keep it running. This is their back-door. It's how they keep their platform fresh. Update both Windows and WINE. If a feature doesn't appear in WINE we won't build on it. That keeps the whole thing working.
