So this Emacs(web/windows/linux/frontier/java/apache/perl, insert as required) thing, is it a platform, OS, or religion? -- None of them, all of them, it really doesn't matter.<p>

(paraphrased from Snowcrash, where the question was Virus, drug or religion, and the answer was the same.) At some point having to ask that question reveals more about the situation or the participants than the answer does.<p>
