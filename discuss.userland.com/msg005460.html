<i>Just so that I'm on the same page with you, could you please explain what you mean by "there have been some surprises lately.."?</i><p>

And was told:<p>

<i>No. Enough whiny bullshit. It's time for a new topic.</i><p>

Umm.. who was being whiny?  You were the one who said yesterday "thanks for not making this an emotional issue".<p>

I hardly am.  Thing is, I haven't been surprised by anything they've been doing lately -- they've been so quiet that anything they do announce is pretty clearly explained.<p>

The only thing I can come up with that's could have been a surprise lately is Darwin... but people who read the MacOS rags had been expecting this for months, if not longer.<p>

So if you can't remember what surprises you were referring to, fine, but you don't have to resort to name calling... that's not cool.<p>

As for moving on to a new topic, that's fine with me.<p>

See ya at WWDC!<p>
