It's great to be able to run old versions on a Mac, but I've moved to a PC now and really miss it!  I've tried using the outline mode in Word and it just doesn't cut it.<p>

Various XML editors are targeted at structured data editing, no paragraphs of thought.  What else is available?  I tried the Jot+Note mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but I need the text "inline."
