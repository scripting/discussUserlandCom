I don't think anyone at Apple is too eager to suggest trying to do this again.  Even if they did, I can't image developers trusting Apple not to screw them on this again.<p>

Now, a lot of apps already support embedding QuickTime.  And QuickTime supports a lot of MIME types.  What if Apple just added text/html as a supported MIME type to QuickTime?  It'd probably work for a viewer.  The question is, could you muck about with JavaScript and the like or not.
