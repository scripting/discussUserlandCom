Now we have a tangible way to show the editors of MacWEEK the benefits of the scriptability of the Mac OS and content development apps. In the past it's been difficult to explain the benefits in concrete terms. Now, if you can hook up to Frontier, it'll be easier to show them how your add-on or tool can make their site richer, or more timely, or connect to other resources on the net.<p>

It goes without saying, I think, if MacWEEK understands your product, they'll be better-able to explain it to their readers.<p>
