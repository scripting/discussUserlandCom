I'm very glad to hear that you're not getting push-back from the principals; that's excellent news!<p>

I must confess that I didn't "get" RSS until I started seeing, not just the big media players, but Tomalak's Realm et al in a lot of places that I wouldn't have expected to otherwise.

Thanks for making all this cool stuff possible, Dave.<p>
