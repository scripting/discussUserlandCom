I just added a call, "mainresponder.members.setprofilepart", that makes that easy.<p>

Also, if you set mailToTheFuture.flNoTemplate to true, we'll send the literal text that's contained in the message, with no wrapper. We did this for Lawrence Lee, he agreed to give us a plug in each email, so we didn't need to add the wrapper. (That's our reward for providing a free service, we get a link in every message we send. Thinking about that IPO!)<p>

In other words, as it's currently set up, I don't think there's anything between you and some gnarly code (on your end, thank god!) to get full HTML fidelity in MTTF messages.
