It is a real pleasure to be able to debate the validity of the product with knowlegable people.  This is also the first debate I've been in where those who disagree with me <I>haven't</I> been questioning my ancestry, current intellectual level, and species affliation.  Thank you all very much, and thanks to Dave for running a great discussion group.<p>

Just wanted to get that off my chest, and, well, words of congratulations are always nice... we hear so much of the opposite sometimes that it's nice to hear something GOOD for change.
