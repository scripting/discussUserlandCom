Scripting News is fully part of UserLand, as the San Jose Mercury-News is part of <a href="http://www.kri.com/">Knight-Ridder</a> or Slate and MSNBC are part of Microsoft. No way to separate the two at the top level, they are part of the same company.<p>

BTW, for 10 points, navigate to the San Jose Mercury-News website from the Knight-Ridder home page. <p>

I think Mappa.Mundi should take that problem on!
