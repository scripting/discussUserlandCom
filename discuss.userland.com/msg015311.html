They cannot distinguish between true invention and clever programming.  Dot-com lawyers realize this, and have told their masters "Hey, we can use the Patent Office to generate license fees and drive away our competition."<p><p>

They are substituting a disfunctional government artifice for genuine marketplace competition.  I agree; "No more pesos for Bezos!"<p><p>

I've never used Priceline.com... the whole idea of not knowing what you're really getting until you've paid for it strikes me as a bit ridiculous. (<i>This</i> is what they've patented?)<p>
