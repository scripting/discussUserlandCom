Perhaps I don't understand how this is supposed to work.  I think the URLS table works like aliases or glossary items in that they substitute the value when the name is supplied.  That is, if I point to:<p>

<a href="http://my.site.edu/discussHomePage">http://my.site.edu/discussHomePage</a><p>

I should really point to<p>

<a href="http://my.site.edu/htmlInterfaces/discussionGroup/">http://my.site.edu/htmlInterfaces/discussionGroup/</a><p>

For this to work, the name/value pairs at config.mainresponder.urls must know that the base address is my.site.edu.<p>

If this is the way it is supposed to work, it doesn't.  The error is that "there is no folder or object database named discussHomePage in myserver:guest databases:www:"  No name/value translation is taking place.  My first assumption was that the base address was wrong, but it doesn't appear to be.
