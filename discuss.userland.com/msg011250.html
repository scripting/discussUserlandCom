<I>I just got off the phone with David Strom who is on the Invisible Worlds advisory board. The take-away message is that they're just getting started, and probably haven't thought very much about making their XMLizations public, but I agree it is the first step, it's what I want to see first, and then let the explanations and visions proceed out from there.</I><p>

Certainly tossing out the DTDs and letting us technical types play with them is one approach to things, and as far as encouraging third-party development is concerned, it may prove critical in the long run.<p>

But another equally valid approach is to say "all the structured data in the world isn't very useful without at least *some* applications to manipulate it," and to not expose much, if anything, until *some* applications exist. There may or may not also be a valid argument (or, more pertinently, a valid business model) that says "we don't just do the data structuring; we provide a middle layer that makes manipulating that data programmatically as simple as possible, and we hope developers will use our API to do that." Real-world customers, investors, and reporters will *still* want to see some apps, though, otherwise they won't be able to get it.<p>

And in the final analysis, you have to appeal to your investors, whether VCs or angels or whomever, *very* few of whom would be qualified to judge an idea like Invisible Worlds from, e.g. the XMLization of EDGAR--and besides, the XMLization of EDGAR isn't the Big Idea anyway; it's just a conveniently complex testbed.<p>

I like where Invisible Worlds is going: I suggested something very similar to it (conceptually) to a local enterpreneur over a year ago, but we lacked the resources to make a go of it and I couldn't figure out how to explain the concept to a non-technical audience... which convinced me that I wasn't the guy to pursue it.<p>

So I'm happy that someone is finally seriously tackling the metadata taxonomy and interface problem.<p>
