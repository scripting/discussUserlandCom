<a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/regions/northwest/NWFLOW/">The Seattle area</a> has a really cool website that allows you to monitor traffic conditions. They also have webcams set up so you can see for yourself what's going on. <i>This is very nice!</i><p>

You can almost <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/regions/northwest/nwflow/camera/nf_cctv538.htm">spy on Microsoft</a> thru one of the webcams..<p>

<a href="http://www4.bluemountain.com/home/ImportantNotice.html?020399">Interesting</a>! Blue Mountain Arts won an injunction against Microsoft in late January.<p>

At the same time, <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3132">we're still curious</a> why David Shinpaugh can't download a fresh copy of MSIE 5.0b2/Win.<p>

<a href="http://www.azfms.com/Travel/freeway.html">Phoenix</a>, <a href="http://www.ksl.com/TV/traff/traffic.htm">Salt Lake City</a> and <a href="http://www.smartraveler.com/scripts/bos_video.asp?city=bos&cityname=Boston">Boston</a> have traffic cams too.<p>

<a href="http://www.its.washington.edu/busviewplus/bus_launch.html">Even sexier</a>, you can use a Java applet to see where Seattle's buses are!<p>

Wired: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/18057.html">Go.com doing well</a>. "Higgins said that, unlike other Internet networks or hubs, the Go Network is a tightly integrated coalition of sites
with a universal navigation, registration, and personalization scheme."<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3140">Chuck Shotton and Dan Shafer</a> debate the merits of server-side programming in Java. Dan says that the best thing about Java is "no memory leaks." I think that's funny because this morning I'm fighting a huge memory leak on my server! Let me add my two cents, there's nothing like memory leaks to spoil a sysop's day! And even more ironic, I think it's some code that's running every five minutes <i>because Chuck's server in Virginia is <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3148">calling it</a> every five minutes, via XML-RPC!</i><p>

I get more and more respect for Murphy every friggin day!!!<p>

<a href="http://www.klcc.org/aretha.html">John Glassburner won</a> a small victory in his fight to get the word "Aretha" added to the Microsoft Office dictionary. <p>

Aretha is not in <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn/?stage=1&word=aretha">WordNet</a> either.<p>

BTW, it would be really cool to get an <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>-based WordNet server up somewhere so I could call it. The dictionary and software are free for downloading from Princeton's <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/wordnet/">server</a>.<p>

Dan Gillmor: <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg022399.htm">Push has a new application</a>? I call these JIT-SEs, and they're invaluable for researchers, writers, columnists.<p>
