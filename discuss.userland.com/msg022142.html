Before closing for the night, I want to say that well before the piece ran I told Markoff that I thought it would all work out and that we would get fair interop in SOAP 1.1. It was his choice to present the quotes in the order he did, and to omit that. As soon as I saw the piece I wrote an <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/04/08/internetCriticTakesOnMicrosoft">essay</a> to clarify. In all the emails and talks with Microsoft people, I said that I feel that the best way get the press to write the story we want is to go the next step and make sure this really is a free market. It's worth the effort.<br><br><a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/01/14/index0a.html?tw=authoring">Jeff Veen</a> on IE6 and standards.<br><br>A new test results <a href="http://jake.soapware.org/currentXmethodsResults">matrix</a> on Jake's SOAP Journal.<br><br>I'm implementing Eric Kidd's <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1208">spec</a> for groups of XML-RPC messages transmitted in "boxcars."

I was surprised that the Markoff piece essentially was a weblog piece. I wonder if the Times realizes that? So many of the weblog pieces are trivializing "Lonelyhearts Club" stories. Here's an example of a weblog making a difference. Clearly XML-RPC was created on the Web. And it wasn't until the work came out in the open on SOAP that the problems could start to be addressed. XML-RPC never had the problems, imho, because it only had a short private gestation. If there were fatal flaws, they would have been discovered quickly, flamed over, and probably corrected. <i>Sometimes it works.</i><br><br>I'm getting too much mail from self-proclaimed "Microsoft Haters." I am <i>not</i> a Microsoft hater. And Mitch, who to this day (according to Markoff) holds a personal grudge against Microsoft says I'm too tenacious? What ever. In the end, if this stuff we're doing works, there will be a new free market for software, without lock-in. If you can get behind that, we could use your help. If you think this is tilting at windmills, join a local Microsoft Haters club, they're all over the place, apparently.<br><br>John Brockman: "Dare to be great!!
