PHP has an online function reference.  One cool aspect is that each function has its own page and users worldwide can add annotations about that specific function.  So newbies can find warnings and pitfalls that other users have experienced with that function.  Sometimes, users provide example source using that function.  For example, check out the page for the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/function.mail.php3">mail</a> function.  You can see that there are 10 or more comments about that function, including a comment about making sure that the server is correctly set up to send mail.
