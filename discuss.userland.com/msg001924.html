The coder needs a way to tell Frontier that the given outline element is a "here document", maybe something similar to the way we convert an element to a comment. Then variable names will get substituted as is. The printf() function in C does this -- no special characters are needed to denote a variable name. This seems better than requiring a special syntax for variables. WinBatch uses that strategy -- you enclose your variable name in a pair of percent signs to signify substitution within a string. Messy. Most people use distinctive variable names anyway. When needed, a backslash or single quotes could be used to protect a token against substitution.

All you would need would be a "#here" mechanism, similar to what are used now in wp objects - "#define '4-line blah'" - except in the outline or script whatever is a sub-heading of that "#here" heading would be treated as a perl-style here document, complete with variable and glossary substitution, etc.<p>
