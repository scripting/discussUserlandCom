Now this is what I call closing a loop ! Great job !<p>

I'm trying to setup my own weblog on our servers and you just delivered 'Weblogs for the rest  of us !'. Kills me !<p>

Here is one feature idea I have had for some time but somehow surfaced when the new 'Stories' page on My.Userland.Com came out. I'm having problems with time ! PST is just too far from GMT and one line of code is all that is necessary to put local server time on every page. Maybe  I am the only one but I always have this fuzzy feeling that I'm lost in time when I go to ScriptingNews !
