The usual answer is the need to hook into proprietary databases, control page turns, etc. I'm sure Dave has good personal reasons for thinking this is a better format for *his* forums.</i><p>

No those aren't the reasons. I actually did it just to piss you off! ;-><p>

Sorry I couldn't resist. The answer is simple. I don't use NNTP, never have, don't think I ever will. So when I look for a solution, I don't think in terms of NNTP. It's human nature to re-invent the wheel. Ask Netscape why they did RSS when <scriptingNews> format was already out there. Embrace and extend. That's what happens after NIH.
