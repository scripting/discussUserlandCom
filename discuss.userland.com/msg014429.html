<i>"Steve has good reason to feel vindicated already. In four of the past five quarters, his $6-billion-a-year company has posted solid revenue gains, and it is expected to have grown by 16% in its fiscal first quarter, which ended in December. (The sole blip, in the previous quarter, was caused by a shortage of microprocessors for Apple's hottest new computer, the G4.) Profits doubled in the last fiscal year. Best of all, Apple's stock set an all-time high of $118 in early December and has been hovering arou nd $100 ever since, eight times the price at its nadir, shortly after Jobs took over."</i>
