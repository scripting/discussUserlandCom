<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13807">I must</a> have been asleep while the rest of the web figured out how to do client-side includes. I first asked for client-side includes three years <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/12/02/AllIWantforChristmas#clientsideincludes">ago</a>. <i>You can't hurry love!</i><p>

The cards are only $100, which is also a significant price break. Even better, they really do deliver performance equivalent to 10 MB per second Ethernet."<p>

<a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg122199.htm">Dan Gillmor lists</a> the top ten good things that happened in technology in 1999. <i>But Dan, what about Edit This Page??</i><p>

The people have <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/results/dave@userland.com/isBushDisgusting">spoken</a>. 68% believe that George W. Bush is disgusting. <p>

<a href="http://dave.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$15">Microsoft</a> is looking for SOAP evangelists. "If you've ever wondered what it would be like to work with the hottest dot-coms such as eBay.com, Dell.com, Buy.com, TicketMaster.com, AskJeeves.com, Quote.com and many others - Here's your chance!"<p>

Now some evangelism of my own. As you can see from the impressions and clicks <a href="http://test27a.userland.com/report/">report</a>, we're doing significant brand-bulding for the weblogs by including the banner ads on many UserLand.Com sites. It's <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/stories/storyReader$184">easy to add</a> the banners to your own sites. Please help the weblogs, the ads are colorful and the sites are personal and interesting.<p>

<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/12/21/bezos/index.html">Salon's Scott Rosenberg</a>: "Amazon was once a company that embraced the happy calculus of the 'network effect' -- the ability the Internet has to multiply the value of everyone's contribution to it, whether you are a book buyer writing a review on Amazon's sites, a bookselling partner in Amazon's co-op program or an investor in the company's stock."<p>

<a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/stories/storyReader$187">The Should-I-Use-XML debate</a> continues. "If I'm going to create a text-based format, I either use XML or re-invent something that does exactly what XML does."<p>

<a href="http://brdbrain.editthispage.com/1999/12/21">Kate Adams</a>: "To hell with John Malkovitch! I'd pay a lot of money to get inside Dave Winer's brain for 15 minutes. And come out alive!" <i>It's actually pretty interesting in here.</i><p>

I had an interesting phone talk with Kate this morning about a <i>Manila Storytelling Festival.</i> Also talked with Jimmi Johnson today. He has a wired warehouse in San Rafael. Also talked with Kate about how Manila is going to be a back-door sell, like the Apple II was. I'm becoming more convinced of this.<p>

<a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$67">With isp.root</a> you can run a Manila site hosting service.<p>
