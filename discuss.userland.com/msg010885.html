Unfortunately it is impossible to derive the persistent URL from www.nytimes.com for articles that you find through the search engine.<p>

Here's the story on how I found this article:<p>

1) At nytimes.com, search for "weblog" and "weblogs" - nothing found.
(after I found the article, I discovered that it simply doesn't use this special term - which I don't like much anyway).<p>

2) Human memory: I remembered reading a <A HREF="http://chicagotribune.com/leisure/tempo/printedition/article/0,2669,SAV-9909070005,FF.html">story on weblogs in the Chicago Tribune</A> from a link on the Scripting News home page. I also remembered that the article had referred to somebody whose site was discussed in the New York Times. I assumed that this indirect reference would be to the desired article. <p>

3) The link to the Chicago Tribune is still high on the Scripting News page, and so was easy to find.<p>

4) The Chicago Tribune article includes this sentence: “Romanesko, who moved to Chicago from St. Paul last weekend, recently was featured in stories in The New York Times and Salon.com.”<p>

5) Copy-paste Romanesko from Chicago Tribune into the New York Times search box. Nothing found.<p>

6) Go to the weblog site mentioned in the Chicago Tribune article: www.obscurestore.com and link from there to the <A HREF=” http://www.obscurestore.com/jimr.html”>author’s personal page</A> in the hope that it would include link to his press coverage. Indeed, this page had some links, including a link to the <A HREF=” http://www.salonmagazine.com/media/col/poni/1999/06/10/weblogs/index.html”>Salon story</A>, but not to the New York Times story.<p>

7) Go to Salon in the hope that it would link to the New York Times article. No such luck.<p>

8) Noted that many of these stories mentioned the MediaGossip site as an important example of an influential weblog. Decided to try to search for that keyword at search.nytimes.com. Success!<p>

Why did my search under step (5) fail? Because the <B>Chicago Tribune had misspelled Romenesko's name</B> (it’s with an E, not an A in the second syllable). Doing a copy-paste on this keyword (which I presumed to be unique and a great search indicator for the desired article) doomed me to failure because the New York Times search engine does not employ a spelling checker.<p>

(Interestingly, because you are mentioned in this article, a search for "Dave Winer" at search.nytimes.com would have retrieved the article as one of seven hits listed - not too many to scan thorugh and reasonably easy to guess from the headline which one is the desired article.)
