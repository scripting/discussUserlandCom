My problem with DMOZ is that it's only half open. The editors of categories are not employees of anyone but they have exclusive power over their domains. There's no room for combinations or competition. <p>

I am working on a design for a category system that allows joins. There could be five editors for each category and meta-directories that choose one from column A, two from column B, etc.<p>

I also want to enable Pike for editing category structures. Outliners are the best way to edit hierarchies. I need to find about a week of solid time to do this stuff. I wonder when that's going to happen! ";->"
