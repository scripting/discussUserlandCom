I have investigated becoming an affiliate with <a href="http://www.bn.com/affiliate/intro.asp?userid=4L1Z1BXBC2&srefer=">Barnes &amp; Nobles</a>, and <a href="http://search.borders.com/associates/index.xcv">Borders</a>. Both shops offer affiliate programs that are less attractive than Amazon's. Does anyone know an affiliate program that matches Amazon's 15 percent for targeted books?<p>

Of course it is illegal to setup affiliate programs with companies other than Amazon (ZDNET: On Feb. 22 Amazon also received the patent for "affiliate programs" on the Web, whereby other Web sites can get profits for referring customers to Amazon), but who cares - I'm Malaysian anyway.<p>

Thanks -- john
