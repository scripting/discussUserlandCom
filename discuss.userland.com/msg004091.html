Absolutely! The feature is already in. Last night we loaded Tomalak in, and I did a search and that's exactly what I got. In each case, column 3 of the search results points to the site that provided the reference. It works exactly like search.userland.com. (It's a clone of search.userland.com, actually. Reusable code, of course.)<p>

Do you have an XMLization of <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/">Robot Wisdom</a>? As soon as you do, we'll work with you to get your site indexed too.
