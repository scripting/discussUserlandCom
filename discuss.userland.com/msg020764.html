I figured you weren't going to run the pointer to the demo, and since it required some active effort on my part (being careful to keep that PC dialed up all the time), I let the demo go down.<p>

So this thing was a dead end.  But it brings up an idea I have been wondering about, which is using P2P to deliver documents by a particular author, e.g. yourself.
