I would love to be able to tell the world why outliners (and technography) work so well. My intution says that it has a lot to do with mental representations.<p>

I'm reviewing an article about different mental representations used by computer programmers; specifically, how the representations differ between OOP and procedural programmers and how this affects their performance.<p>

The more I think about a "Psych Geek" website the more I like it. There's a quite a number of topics that I would love to write about. Stay tuned!<p>

P.S. I'm going to be a first-time technographer tomorrow.
