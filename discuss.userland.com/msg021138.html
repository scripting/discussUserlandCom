Do you mean "public domain" in the strict legal sense, or "public domain" in the practical sense?<p>

To the best of my knowledge, TeX is public domain software in strict legal sense. People have definitely created proprietary versions of TeX, and with permission from Knuth. <i>[Update: I appear to be wrong. Please see <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21160">Fredrik's post</a> for details.]</i><p>

Most so-called "public domain" software carries a copyright and a <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/customdns/LICENSE.X11?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&cvsroot=customdns">very generous license</a>. Technically, this software is not in the public domain at all, because it carries a copyright.<p>

There are some really subtle legal issues here (some of which are apparently related to disclaimers of liability). But I'm not a lawyer, so I won't go into the details.<p>

<i>I'm really pretty upset that my question was used to argue for the rationale of the GPL. I'm trying not to let it get my blood up.</i><p>

My humble apologies. No offense was intended, certainly.<p>

For the record, I'm not trying to <i>convince</i> anyone to use the GPL. I'm trying to explain why it exists, and why some honest developers choose to use it.<p>

Mind you, I'm a little wary of the GPL myself. In my eyes, it serves a useful purpose, but it tends to create outages. So I occasionally spend time convincing people <i>not</i> to use the GPL, for one reason or another.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
