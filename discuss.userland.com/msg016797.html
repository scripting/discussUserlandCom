Mozzilla provides a cross platform developement framework, the XP Toolkit. You can develop a cross platform app with the toolkit.<p>

You could use MFC to develop applications, and they run on intel chips on MS windows. Then you can spend another $15k and buy MFC portability code for Unix and linux (or use wine, etc).<p>

<i>If an approach isn't popular on Windows, then the same approach delivered in a cross-platform way will likely still be unpopular. </i> Define unpopular. Is it 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% of the development market?<p>

<p> We know, it's the apps. DOJ knows, it's the apps. MS knows, it's the apps.
<ul> <li> MS Apps are deisgned to drive users to MS OS's. <li> MS works to discourage solutions which will not drive users to use MS OS's (or products derived from MS OS's) <li> MS is a monopoly (That is a Fact that will not be overturned on appeal). <li> At present, there are no money making competitors to the MS desktop OS on X86 chips. (How many of those linux boxes came with a copy of an MS OS that was tossed? 80-90%?)<li> Since MS is a monopoly, the rules are different. MS cannot work to discourage development of alternative to it's desktop OS dominance.
<li> and one final thing. When things are no longer competition, they seem to dissappear. NT4 had software OpenGl. NT5 no software openGL. MS provided drivers don't support openGl, even for the best of breed openGL cards of thier day.<p>

</ul><p>

 <i>A Mozilla/XUL based custom browser might reach 98% of users instead of 90%</i> <p> The biggest thing about this is that the underlying OS does not matter. If the market share for an MS OS dropped to 50%, the mozzilla framework would still be at 98% (if not 100% by the time the MS market share dropped to 50%)<p>

What did Cringley say was the reason why MS went out and bought DOS? They did not want to lose the programming languages market?<p>

Did MS add the IE to make sure that it did not lose the OS market? Or was it to benefit users? Oop's you've got a monopoly, now, can't protect that OS.
