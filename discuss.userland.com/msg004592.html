WUGNET: <a href="http://www.wugnet.com/wininfo/display.asp?ID=2015">Gates on Linux</a>. "Linux doesn't have the graphics interface. It doesn't have the rich set of device drivers. So certainly we think of it as a competitor in the student and hobbyist market. But I really don't think in the commercial market, we'll see it [compete with Windows] in any significant way." Oh boy, Bill doesn't get it. Linux is grabbing the high ground in the server market. I think Microsoft would do well to come up with a faceless version of NT with just a command-line interface and work tirelessly on performance in this configuration.<p>
