An RDF query tool isn't really much different from a basic XML query tool.  The power of RDF is agreeing on the semantics of particular element names (RDF properties), not in how they're represented.<p>

For example, any *ML document can have a <title> element, but do all <title>s really mean the title of a document, book, message, etc.?  No, some <title>s may be organizational titles or awards.<p>

RDF provides the underlying framework so people can begin using common element names within their documents/data.  <a href="http://purl.org/dc/documents/rec-dces-19990702.htm">Dublin Core</a> is one effort for defining a set of common tags for "library catalog" type information.<p>

If a *ML document says "we use Dublic Core elements", you can be pretty confident that when you do an XML/RDF query for "dc:title" you're gonna get the <title> of a document, book, message, etc. and not an organizational or awarded title.
