I've recently started converting my collection to MP3 in a systematic way (rather then a track here or there on a whim).  It contains a lot of classical music and I didn't want to compromise sound quality at all... portable crap is no benefit over a good CD.<p>

A year ago, there <I>was</I> no encoder good enough to handle my demands.  Now there is... the latest version of GNU's encoder, <A HREF="http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/">lame</A> 3.85b, at high quality settings, is absolutely <I>stunning</I>.<p>

For some hard data, see <a href="http://users.belgacom.net/gc247244/analysis.htm">this analysis of the encoders</a>.<p>

On the softer data side... I've encoded some Gershwin works now from a Gershwin CD I have.  Using a high-quality ripper and high-quality lame settings, I got 10:1 compression and I can't hear the difference.  The clarinet whoop at the beginning of Rhapsody in Blue sounds like a clarinet despite being ultra-quiet (clarinets often sound synthetic in MP3s, as do strings), a banjo sounds just like a banjo with no audible mushing of the sounds, it's just amazing.<p>

The key is to use a good ripper (<a href="http://software.mp3.com/software/individual/windows/ripper/1256.html">Exact Audio Copy</a> for Windows, cdparanoia for Linux, and lame with high quality settings (I use "-V 1 -b 128 -h -m j -q1" as <a href="http://users.belgacom.net/gc247244/quality.htm">this site</a> recommends).<p>

If you're still a skeptic about the quality, try this.  It converted me.  (And I thought this CD would kill it...)
