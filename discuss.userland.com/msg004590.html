In fact, that mention of the OS differences shows that you could do an OS detection and serve different XUL files to accomodate differences in OS's.<p>

You  _should_ be able to create an app, and have it run on mac, pc, unix, palm OS etc. all by just having a different CSS spec.  <p>

If you find things you want/need and dont see - you should post to the xpfe newsgroup!  It's not too late to influence design decisions.<p>

But as far as I know, they are really pushing to have xul cross-os.
