People draw these lines because the distinction is important to them.<p>

Whenever I get a juicy tidbit of news, I want to know if I can share it with my friends; it's the same with a neat piece of software.  There is value in being able to share -- all other things being equal, I'd prefer getting sharable software to non-sharable.  "Open" software can be shared without risking its author's wrath; "closed" software cannot.  To ask people not to use labels for this is to ask them not to care -- that's asking a bit much in my opinion.<p>

This isn't to say that the "closed" guys should be made to feel bad that they've chosen not to allow their creations to be shared this way; they are *their* creations, after all.  However, they've chosen not to extend a right that the "open" folks extend; this distinction is valuable to many, and (I suspect) impossible to express in a way that sounds non-perjorative to all.<p>

Phillip
