I am sure this has already been discussed, but I couldn&#180;t work this out so I have to ask for advice:<p>

How do I activate the Frontier search engine for my Manila Site?<p>

In userland.com I find something that tells me to look into htmlInterfaces.root for information on how to make a search page but that seems to predate Frontier 6.<p>

I assume that Manila has some sort of indexing, or am I wrong and that needs to be provided externally?<p>

Any hints would be appreciated.<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
