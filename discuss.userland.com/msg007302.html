dave you are right. these are exciting times for frontier users. and i admire your spirit to implement this new <b>community-service(s) that manila seems to be. </b>
as a developer who knows what it means to host webservers that get several million hits a day i can tell you this will not be an easy task for your frontier tools. especially  as long as frontier is not running as a faceless unix-server-application. you can almost not imagine how bad WinNT behaves under heavy load. the more traffic your webservice generates the more strange errors will happen on your NT-Servers. 
From my experiance it will be almost impossible to run a dynamic version of frontier under the load of millions of hits per day. 
but it will be possible if you mix dynamic page generation on WinNT with serving static pages from linux . Following this trail will definitely be successful.
Beside this i would everywhere where you have to collect huge amounts of member- and / or userdatas also follow a twofolded strategy. Collect the datas with frontier and store the memberdatas during the session inside frontiers odb but after the session wright the data to an OODB ( like ObjectStore or Poet : both tools deal fabulous with XML )or an relational database under Linux or Solaris.
If i have read right between the lines you are already experimenting with this kind of strategy when you store parts of your memberprofile-data inside zope on linux.
anyway it is fun to be a frontier developer and to be part of the game<p>
