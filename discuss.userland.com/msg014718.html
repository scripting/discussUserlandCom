I've just played with it a little bit.  I mainly don't do anything more than animation.  I'm still exploring the types of connections available to the plug-in.<p>

The one way I know would work is to use Generator.  It could create either a .swf or a .gif/.jpg file.  I'm looking into it's hooks right now.<p>

You could also try to import the data into flash at runtime.  This is the option I'm playing with now.<p>

I mainly program in Director.  For it to work all I would need is a url I could call that returned nothing but the story content in html. <p>

An XML interface is also an option.  What type of an XML interface does manilla support?  Is there documentation anywhere?
