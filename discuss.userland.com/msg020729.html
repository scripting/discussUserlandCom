Once again, I have to respectfully disagree.  In the case of napster, for example, it is easier to download the music than it is to get up and go to a record store, even if the music were free.  It is not the fact that the music is monetarily free that really motivates people.  It is the fact that it is easy.  If napster had a way of taking my money every time I listened to a song, I would certainly pay.  There are quite a few nascent ideas for how to approach micropayments or "services" whereby you get IP without having to actively pay, but the artist gets your money nonetheless.  This technology <b>will</b> work itself out.
