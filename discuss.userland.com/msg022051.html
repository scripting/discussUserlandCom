"Der durchschnittliche IQ der Silicon-Valley-Unternehmer steigt wieder auf sein fr&uuml;heres Stratosph&auml;renniveau."

An event that happens once every 24 hours on <i>someone else's machine</i> can be difficult to debug. But we're now in blade-popping mode on this little <a href="http://www.thetwowayweb.com/payloadsForRss#anExample">project</a>. Adam wants this as much as I do, that's why the project is working. It takes two. And it's even worse than it appears.. <br><br>	Adam plopped a 19 megabyte Quicktime movie into my enclosures folder last night. It took 1218.833 seconds to download at 2:04:13AM. I clicked on it on my Log page. It played. No wait. <i>Yes!</i><br><br>	This is what we mean by "The Two-Way-Web."

Our memory management needs some refinement now that we're receiving such large things over HTTP. <br><br>	But this is what I get up in the morning for. Some people do it for world peace, others like to debate in the Senate, or file a patent, drive a cab, teach some kids, make a cheesecake, or pitch an excellent baseball game.
