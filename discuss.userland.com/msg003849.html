The Web has lots of provisions for smart servers, but most of the people who make servers seem to be lazy and they don't support the smart features or they hide them. The result is that many people make the assumption that you can't rely on any Web server to be configured correctly, or even to be configurable at all. The result of this assumption was the piling on of more and more unnecessary features into browsers.
