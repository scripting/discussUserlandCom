One way to make money on a browser is to reconceptualize it as the user's defender in cyberspace. Pure page rendering is not value-add (and should be a system-level service anyway). But navigation aids might have value: a browser that would color links differently depending on whether the destination was valuable. Or place a "seal of approval" on ads for credible companies and a warning icon on top of misleading ads. (Note that an ad-rating service has to be on the client side: you can neither trust the advertiser nor the website to honestly disclose whether they are out to cheat the customers.)<p>

If a user-defending browser would save you 10 minutes every day and/or save you from being abused, then you ought to be willing to pay for it.<p>

Some people are already paying for services that prevent them (or their kids) from seeing porn.
