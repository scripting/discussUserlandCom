There I get "com/jclark/xml/sax/Driver" in the "result" field.<p>

I also tried it on Windows with Opera 3.51 (no response, don't think JavaScript communication works with the Java plugin) and Netscape 4.08 (gave an error, "document.applets.xmlrpc has no properties"). I also tried IE4 for Mac, but didn't expect it to work because there isn't any JavaScript/Java communication, so that's understandable.<p>

Any ideas? Anyone else able to get it to work? :-)
