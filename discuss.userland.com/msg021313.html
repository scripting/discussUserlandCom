Though difficult to manage broadly (needlessly resource intensive in most cases), Internet activity can be tracked.<p>

Now, conceive laws against unlawful use of intellectual property (as defined by courts) that are draconian enough and enforced randomly enough that it dries up underground transmissions.<p>

Does this make any sense?
