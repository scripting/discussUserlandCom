They would be horribly complex...if Nike and New Balance were sneaker companies. Nike and New Balance - Nike in particular - do not sell just sneakers. They sell inline skates, fitness outerwear, sports bras, socks, t-shirts, sunglasses, and all sorts of other products.<p>

First and foremost, however, these companies are selling a lifestyle. Just like the Gap, just like MTV, just like Abercrombie and Fitch. Nike doesn't sell shoes...they sell youth, fitness, confidence, and cool.<p>
