I use Netscape Communicator 4.5.1 on a new Mac PPC G3, and during an especially long download, such as the new Star Wars trailer, I get cut off inexplicably.  Could my problems with Netscape in any way be related to the use of the Userland extension, IdleTime? <p>

This extension installs with Netscape, and the extension can not be eliminated at the user level.  If I disable it, and/or trash it, a new copy of the extension is ceated in my extensions folder the next time I boot up. <p>

My hunch is that your extension has been added to Netscape for the benefit of LAN managers and ISP service providers so that they can manage a limited number of users on a network at a time.  But is there any way to temporarily disable it, either from the user side or the server side to see if it is creating problems for users? <p>
