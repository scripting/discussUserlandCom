So, what we're going to do is wait for Netscape to publicly release the new RSS spec, and in the meantime we're going to do rev 2 of Scripting News format. <p>

I don't buy into the world revolving around Netscape. It's partially our job to drive the technology too. I'm familiar with the "we're the platform vendor" rap. I prefer equal working relationships. <p>

So we'll move forward too, which seems reasonable since our format predates Netscape's by more than a year.
