This year I have not renewed it. I still seem to get the magazines, but I usually just let them stack up in my mail box and then throw them away. I hardly ever read them.  <p>

I figure that if I want to read infoworld, I can do it from the website. I never go to the infoworld website.  Never.  I don't have a bookmark of the front page, and I can't think of the last time I went to their front page.  <p>

I still read infoworld articles though.  But only because they get mentioned and linked to on Scripting News and on Wired News.  If either of these websites began putting in a generic link to infoworld, instead of to the article, I wouldn't go look it up. <p>

I have done that enough times to know that the information just isn't that valuable.  Trying to crawl through most sites looking for something that you know is there is a huge waste of time.  <p>

ps. Sometimes I wonder why sites don't have indexes as well as search engines.  It would sure make things easier.  I find indexes in books really useful.
