Website documentation has to be a lot better on installation and hardware requirements. I am still trying to resolve if Frontier is installed under WinNT or Win2K, if it can run like a Unix daemon, and still have people use the same machine (provided they don't do anything strenuous), or is it pretty much a dedicated system afterwards? Also, what are the minimum and recommended hardware specs for Frontier?<p>

On a somewhat disturbing note, while I am glad that the technology called Manila is multilingual, it omits Filipino as one of the translations....
