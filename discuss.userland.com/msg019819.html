<blockquote>"The K-219 was armed with nuclear weapons; a secondary explosion could have spread fallout all along the Eastern seaboard of the US. The resulting fire caused the remote controls for the reactors to fail and two men were sent to hand-crank the control rods into place. One man collapsed and was evacuated; the other stayed to shut down the last reactor and prevent a meltdown. The sub was then scuttled.<p>
