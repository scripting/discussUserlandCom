We started archiving in June 1999, so there's already a history showing how each site developed (or didn't). The archive and the stories it points to will also be used to seed a search engine. <p>

If you write an application to build on this flow of stories, please read the files no more than once a day, and be smart about caching on your end, don't crawl the whole site every day.<p>

The rollover happens at midnight Pacific.<p>

There are two other backend features, <a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$63">explained</a> on the site.
