A scenario. Suppose according to the DDS my channel should belong in the Mac Scripting category. But I also think it should be in the scripting category, since we run other other systems. If James feels it really belongs in Mac scripting, what happens?<p>

This raises a bunch of questions -- Does DDS know about scripting? Does it know about the Macintosh? Does it tell James whether Frontier is a scripting system or a Macintosh scripting system?<p>

I was a user of the DDS for quite a few years, but that was a long time ago. I never knew how it worked behind the scenes I was just a user. Inform us. Also if possible tell us a little about yourself. For some reason your profile seems to be broken. I've reported it as a broken link. <p>

Could you visit <a href="http://prefs.userland.com/">http://prefs.userland.com/</a>. Does it work? If so, a pointer to a website or a little info about yourself would be helpful. Thanks.
