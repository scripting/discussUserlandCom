I have a number of sites:<p>

<a href="http://www.foo.com/siteA/">http://www.foo.com/siteA/</a><BR>
<a href="http://www.foo.com/siteB/">http://www.foo.com/siteB/</a><BR>
<a href="http://www.foo.com/siteC/">http://www.foo.com/siteC/</a><BR>
<a href="http://www.foo.com/siteD/">http://www.foo.com/siteD/</a><p>

Sites A, B, and C belong to individual departments within the company. Site D is supposed to be the company wide forum (though they prefer to call it topics). Within this site they'd like to have several discusssion groups for things such as:<p>

* volunteer programs<BR>
* housing available/wanted<BR>
* Items for sale<BR>
* General discussion (instead of spamming the company)<p>

It would be really cool if each of these could have their own "/discuss" and "/discuss/topics" pages.<p>

If I were to make separate sites for each of these Discussion Groups, then I would only want the Discussion Group part of the site, i.e. I would want the "/discuss" page to be the home page of each of these sites.<p>

Am I making any sense?
