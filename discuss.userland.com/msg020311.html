They're groupware. I linked to Keola's outline from my outline, and rebuilt my directory, and there's his tree right inside mine. The next step is to get the editor name and email address to be his on pages he's the editor of. Important note, even though in HTML it looks like they're part of the same document, our trees are separate, linked by a URL to an XML file that's read over HTTP. You'll all be users of this someday, I'm sure of it. It's a strange world, as spacy as the Web, imho, in the early days.<br><br>You're all going to love <a href="http://www.go.com/Titles?col=WW&qt=DeCSS+source&svx=home_searchbox&sv=IS&lk=noframes">this one</a>. Disney, a member of the MPAA, operates a search engine. It links to <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/disneyPointingToDeCSSSource.gif">lots</a> of DeCSS sources. What's their excuse?<br><br><a href="http://zopefish.weblogs.com/pictures/viewer$242">David Brown posts</a> another in a series of screen shots as progress reports.<br><br><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/rt/08252000/">O'Reilly Network publisher</a> Dale Dougherty talks with "some of the core developers behind the new spec for RSS 1.0 about the background behind RDF, the need for a standard, and what RSS enables." <br><br><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$916">Here are my comments</a> posted after listening to the O'Reilly radio show.<br><br><a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newAug00.htm#23Aug00-opensource">David McCusker</a>: "It stinks whenever a group says, 'Our way or the highway!'" <br><br>We got <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/08/25/2119226&mode=flat">Slashdotted</a> yesterday, which is interesting, because the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/25#anotherProblemForTimewarner">page</a> they pointed to was on one of our dynamic servers. It held up really well. Then looking at the rankings for <a href="http://www.userland.com/mostReadSitesYesterday">yesterday</a>, it took a normally inactive site to number three in the Top 100. What's interesting to me is that it didn't take it to the #1 spot. I thought Slashdotting would swamp us with hits, but not so.<br><br><a href="http://www.songtrellis.com/directory/">Dave Luebbert</a> is using Radio UserLand's HTML directory feature on his website.<br><br><a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$1104">Call for creative input</a>. "We need a three or four character file extension for outlineDocuments, so they can be differentiated from other kinds of XML files that we may want to upstream and otherwise process with Radio UserLand."<br><br>Also, it would be great if someone from this community could evaluate <a href="http://www.tuneprint.com/">yesterday's mind bomb</a> from MIT. Does it really work? How would we integrate it with Radio UserLand? Even if their approach is imperfect, just having something to interface with would help us finish up a bunch of the loose-ends in Radio UserLand, esp in the right-click <a href="http://static.userland.com/images/radiodiscuss/rightClick1.gif">menu</a> for songs and on <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/">ourfavoritesongs.com</a>.<br><br><a href="http://tim.oreillynet.com/discuss/msgReader$63">Tim O'Reilly comments</a> on the base64 question. He says it <i>is</i> open source.

"The situation was deteriorating badly. None of the landing wheels could descend. We would need to fly around in circles at a low altitude, the pilot explained, to burn up most of the fuel so that the plane would not catch fire when we landed on its metal belly."<br><br><a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/2000/08/20/0825linuxmac.html">MacWEEK</a>: "Open-source advocate Eric S.
