More bandwidth doesn't mean the wait goes away.  I still wait for pages from Yahoo, scripting.com, or wherever, because there are bottlenecks all over the internet, not just between me and my ISP.  <p>

I want applications that work quickly and pages that come up in under the magic 1 second (which Jakob Nielsen reports is what traditional HCI research shows users are prepared to tolerate, see <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/responsetime.html">http://www.useit.com/papers/responsetime.html</a>)<p>

In other words, when you have lots of bandwidth, you do more, more quickly.  I spend less time waiting and more time working.  Only if it'll download in less than a second am I prepared to tolerate a pretty interface.
