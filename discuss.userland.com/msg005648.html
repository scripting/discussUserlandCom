Why are they relevant-interesting?
Well, perhaps Frontier could team up with these folks via the org..
What org? Well the exolab - look here:

Here's a quote:
ExOffice thus suggests a new cooperation model between individual developers and consulting companies: the ExoLab
                    Open Source Development Center. The ExoLab would be an Open Source software development center where
                    developers and consulting companies would be invited for one week to one month long development sessions. During
                    such sessions, experiences would be exchanged, ideas would be discussed and some code would be produced. The
                    main parts of a large development project would still be coded outside of the ExoLab by involved developers, but such
                    sessions would allow developers and engineers from consulting companies to "put a face on an email address".
