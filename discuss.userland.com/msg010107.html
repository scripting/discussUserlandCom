One moment stands out in my mind, though--it caused a nasty sinking feeling in my gut that I've never forgotten. One day, I was reading Slashdot and saw that Corel had vowed to support Linux.<p>

Given Corel's track record, I was terrified that Linux might be doomed. Everything they've touched in the last five years has tuend out to be a lemon</i><p>

I think it's easy to say that Corel is grasping at straws trying to stay alive right now.  They tried to take on the big players at their own game and lost badly.<p>

However, I think that the people doing the work either "get" it or are seriously trying to.<p>

I've had talks with various Corel software folk from "grunt" level to project leads to VP of Software Development.  This was all in the context of them forking KDE for their own distribution.  What it comes down to is that all of them (up to the VP level) really *want* to do the right thing.  They recognize the power of the community and they sincerely want to be "good guys" within it.  Unfortunately, they also acknowledge that they have a long history of very closed development and closed minds.<p>

It'll take awhile, but I'm confident that Corel will eventually be a one of the stellar citizens in the Linux community.
