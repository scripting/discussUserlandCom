"If you bought an ad on the op-ed page of the NY Times, there's nothing to stop the Times from running an editorial that is critical of your company, or even against the interests of your company, and they could run it on the <i>same page as your ad."</i><p>

News.Com: <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,41291,00.html">eBay shuts down search engines</a>. "Leading online auctioneer eBay is clamping down on outside companies that use search engines to find items for sale on its site, arguing that the technology affects site performance."<p>

Wired: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/21577.html">MS Denies Spy Key</a>. "The issue centers around two keys that ship with all copies of Windows. The keys grant an outside party the access it needs to install security components without user authorization. The first key is used by Microsoft to sign its own security service modules. Until late Thursday, the identity and holder of the second key had remained a mystery."<p>

Michael Swaine: <a href="http://webreview.com/pub/1999/08/27/feature/index2.html">Why Rebol Matters</a>.
