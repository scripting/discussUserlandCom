<pre>
I'm on a Mac G3
MacOS v8.6
Frontier 6.0
mainResponder (updated as of 5/26 9 AM)
</pre>
In the DG I set flShowFileUpload to true for mainresponder.discuss.newMessageForm.  The Attach file line appeared as expected.  I attached a file, hit the Post Message button and got this error...
<blockquote>
Sorry! There was an error: Assignment over existing table object &Ograve;attachfile&Oacute; is not allowed. Delete the object first, or use table.assign to override protection. <p>

The error was detected by Frontier 6.0 in mainResponder.respond.
</blockquote>
Using the handy dandy mainResponder debugging technique, I was able to trace down where I think the problem is.  When I hit the goto button I'm taken to mainResponder.respond.  The line reads...
<blockquote>
adrparamtable^.postArgs [i] = latinToMac.convert (adrparamtable^.postArgs [i])<p>

It's in the //convert text from latin to Mac character sets, if this is a Mac bundle.
