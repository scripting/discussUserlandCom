We started out doing real-time ("meeting") software, 
but found people don't use such tools unless the information is
available both before and after the meeting.  When we moved to
doing both synchronous and asynchronous support, it made for
easy setup, easy followup, and the material feeds well into
the next meeting.  The ability for people to go in either
individually or as a group and continue working on notes and
other artifacts generated in a meeting is very important.<p>

Speaking of meeting tools, I've done a bunch of meetings using
big electronic whiteboards, and there's some great potential
there as well.  See <a href="http://www.smarttech.com">http://www.smarttech.com</a> for information
on one such product.<p>
