The thought of acknowledging everyone you see in NY is awe-inspiring. People would spend their whole days saying Hello how are you. There would be no time to answer or wait for an answer. BTW, I think the habits have changed, NY has mellowed, since then I've noticed that people *do* sometimes say hello to strangers. That may have more to do with having great hair (sometimes), as opposed to being an angry pimply teenager (which is what I was).
