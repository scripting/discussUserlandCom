The XML-RPC specification is silent on the issue of synchronous vs. asynchronous calls. Client software can choose to present either calling mechanism. <p>

The question is, do any of the client software packages present an asynchronous calling mechanism?

some terms: sRPC == sync RPC     aRPC == async RPC
XML-RPC explicitly requires a return packet to confirm the invocation. Your explanation suggests:
. the server is aware of the a/synch nature of its procedure
. provides an XML-RPC response packet before the call is actually 
  evaluated.
. That the a/sync nature of the server procedure is immutable.<p>

I think this complicates the design of the server and constrains its potential uses. IMO a client ought to be capable of asking the XML-RPC mechanism for a function call to be treated essentially as a message, with an optional callback when completed. <p>

This made life easier when building our system. One complication was the invocation of a sRPC on a server with outstanding aRPCs from the given client. I decided that the sRPC should wait for all outstanding aRPCs to complete, before being evaluated. I understand that this may be a bit complicated, but for our systems design, it was a comfortable decision. Any thoughts?
