It's next to impossible to figure out what's going on in the computer/web industry by reading press releases from Microsoft &etc.  I rarely have anything to add - I'm an observer, not a player - but I'm still interested.  The discussion about Webmonkey and Evolt is a perfect example.  I get to hear about a cool resource I was previously unaware of, and I get some context.  Very nice.
