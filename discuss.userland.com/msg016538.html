Let's make software, and presume friendship until proven otherwise.<p>

Raymond, and O'Reilly (to a lesser extent) have been (IMHO) polarizing things, forming an exclusive club, and hurting the software process by doing so.<p>

Let's move beyond zealotry, finally, it didn't work, the only thing that works is let everyone decide for themselves what they want to do, and quit blustering.<p>

I learned a lot about this when I got to know Brian Behlendorf, a programmer who actually makes open source software. I found we had a lot more in common than Raymond and O'Reilly would have you believe.<p>

That pisses me off. These guys are PR mouthpieces, and they've been telling the wrong story.
