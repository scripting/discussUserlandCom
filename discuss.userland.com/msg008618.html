Key question, does the wireless networking only work with Macs?<p>

From the Apple wireless networking <a href="http://www.apple.com/airport/faq1.html">FAQ</a>: "Can I use a PC notebook in an AirPort network? Yes. Because AirPort is based on the IEEE 802.11 DSSS standard, there are a number of companies with products that allow a PC to be used in an AirPort network."<p>

Don Clark, a DaveNet reader, asks: "Have you figured out if you can use an AirPort at the airport?" It's a good idea. With dynamic TCP address allocation, which is now a standard feature in Windows and Mac, you could walk into a special room, open your laptop, check your mail, browse the web, close the laptop and be done without plugging any wires into your machine or doing any configuration thru dialogs. I'm not a hardware guy, but from a software standpoint our laptops are ready to do this.<p>
