This makes the <i>huge</i> assumption that what RedHat says becomes the Linux standard.  I'm not yet convinced that that is the case.<p>

Most of the press regarding RedHat being the "leader" of Linux distributions seems very US-centric (big surprise there: most US media don't even know the rest of the world exists unless we are attacking somebody).  I seem to remember reading somewhere that RedHat is actually the THIRD largest Linux distribution world-wide and is first only in the US.  Pacific HiTech and SuSE are both bigger in total market share.<p>

In any event, of all the major distributions, RedHat and Debian are the <i>only</i> ones that will immediately ship Gnome.  The rest already do (or will) ship KDE.<p>

Corel has also been getting a lot of press for their planned "user-friendly" distribution.  Their desktop?  KDE.<p>

Now I'll admit to being very <i>very</i> biased towards KDE... but saying that Gnome will become the standard just because RedHat chooses it is just wrong.
