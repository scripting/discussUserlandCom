Jefferson was influenced heavily by Locke's formula of "life, liberty and property", which regards the individual's mental labour as the basis of his identity. The American Dream is based upon the notion of the self-made individual; and you can't be self-made unless you have the concept of intellectual property to defend your labour. <p>

Of course, what you do with the fruits of your labour is a matter of personal choice...<p>

From this side of the Atlantic, a happy and peaceful Easter.
