Jini has a lot of layers. For example, RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a synchronous binary RPC protocol that could be compared to XML-RPC (although RMI has a bunch of Java-specific features).<p>

Then there's the separate, UDP-based, discovery protocol that I mentioned earlier.<p>

Then there's the directory service (JavaSpaces/Linda).<p>

Then there's the distributed transaction manager.<p>

Then there's the leasing protocol.<p>

No XML anywhere; all the data formats appear to be based on serialized Java objects.
