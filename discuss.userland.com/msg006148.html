I wouldn't count on it. I gave up a few hours ago. They want me to send the laptop back yet again and go thru the loop and I said no. <p>

The problem is clearly that they don't test the machines before they send the back to the customer. This is where the disconnect is. <p>

We've even learned that at least in some situations, they *can't* test it. So they rely on us to do it, and of course we get no closer to solving the problem.
