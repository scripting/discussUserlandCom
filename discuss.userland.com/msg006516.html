The main reason for this version is to correct an occasional bug reported by Randy Prudhel. Occasionally a letter "f" is interpreted as a whitespace character inside a tag or an attribute. The problem resulted from the fact that regex and Frontier apparently don't recognize the formfeed character as a '\f'.<p>

Also new in this version is a modification to getAttributeList() so that attributes without an associated value are also included in the list returned. <p>

There's also a new function to rapidly turn a list into a string, without truncation of the list elements.<p>
