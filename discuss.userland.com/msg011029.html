<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$460">Sam DeVore</a> is using XML-RPC to connect his students, via HyperCard, to a Frontier discussion group. <i>Excellent!</i><p>

Last summer the IETF ran this <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-iesg-using-http-00.txt">critique</a> of XML-RPC. I think they missed that XML-RPC is merely a formalization for the body of POSTs to allow diverse scripting environments to connect over the Internet. There are lots of one-off solutions that only work for a single environment. The purpose of XML-RPC is to unify the one-offs, so we can do some building.<p>

It's been a few months since <a href="http://www.thirdvoice.com/">Third Voice</a> showed up on the web. What contribution have they made? Here's an <a href="http://www.msu.edu/~bowersj2/scripting4.gif">example</a>, Scripting News viewed thru a Third Voice lens. Viral web app? No, a mindless cesspool. I wonder what kind of comments accumulate on the Third Voice home page?<p>

Further, their technology is pretty weird. They install a <i>web server</i> on the user's machine! Why? <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11014">Jeremy Bowers</a> has been looking into this. Thanks!
