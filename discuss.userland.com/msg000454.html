Just to name a few...<p>

- local to the page, to the local cluster of pages, to the server, to the domain, to the high level domain. (How far from the author's control am I going ?)
- human language of the destination
- systems language of the destination (What rev of html/xml are needed to see this destination?)
- freshness of the destination (when was the destination updated vs. the source page's freshness?)
- author's take on relevance to the story compared to other links ("You MUST see this link." "For your convenience." "Barely relevant.")
- popularity of this link with other readers of this page ("Most popular link")
- viewer's history with this link (have I been there recently? Ever?)
- degree of political freedom of the country of origin
- security/anonymity provided at destination 
- offensive content info compared to my personal prefs profile
- attractive content info compared to my personal prefs profile 
- public bonds, certs, and trusts of the destination<p>

Engines for generating all of this information have been built or posited. So design issues for annotation of links become: <p>

- how do we present these many dimensions of information without disrupting the flow of narrative? <p>

- How do we do so in a way that adapts to the priorities of the individual viewer within the context of their current viewing experience? Some attributes may be more important when reading stories about a revolution in Lagos, at Microsoft, or in health care.
