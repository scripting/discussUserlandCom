I have read the XML-RPC <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/rpc.html">specification</a> with great
interest.  I have the following issues with it:<ol><p>

<li>There is no support for internationalization, despite the
support present in XML.  Since the MIME type is text/xml
(as opposed to application/xml), the character encoding is
US-ASCII unless overridden.  No mention is made of support for
character references like &#x2020; (DOUBLE DAGGER).<p>

I would suggest supporting either "text/xml; charset='utf-8'".
In addition, the references to "ASCII" in the spec should be changed.<p>

<li>There is no support for integers longer than 32 bits.<p>

I suggest allowing <int> values to be arbitrarily large, reserving
the <i4> tag for 32-bit signed values.  This would be an upward
compatible extension for senders; receivers would have to check
whether <int> data was in fact within the 32-bit signed range
if backward compatibility is desired.<p>

<li>Floats are fairly useless because no rules exist for setting limits.<p>

I suggest that no receiver be allowed to reject a value which can be
represented in 32-bit IEEE floats: between 1e-149 and 1e104, positive
or negative, or zero.<p>

<li>The statement that "A string can be used to encode binary data"
cannot be true, because arbitrary binary data cannot appear in XML
documents: there is no way to represent bytes of value 0-8, 11-12, or
14-31.  This is only a documentation consideration, as the base64
element does allow the representation of arbitrary binary data.<p>

<li>The very limited fault struct means that more complex exceptions
such as Java, Python, or C++ support must be flattened into strings
for return to the client, even though XML-RPC has ways of encoding more
complex objects.<p>

I suggest allowing a struct within a fault object.
