Their point was "Being at ease with technology is not age related."  Of course I agree with that.  I mentioned my daughter only conversationally.  I could have just as easily said, "I was working with [someone] recently and needed to introduce namespaces to [them] for some similar stuff. [...]" and <i>my</i> intent would have been the same.<p>

Notably, since the thread got sidetracked about my daughter, there was no substantive answer to the real question: Why are XML Namespaces difficult for some?  Is it the concept, a lack of support in the tools available to some people, or complex usage (bad examples) of it in some specifications?
