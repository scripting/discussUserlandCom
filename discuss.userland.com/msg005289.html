The community discussed tip, tricks, and equivalent actions in the two operating systems.  It was a fascinating list that produced some great FAQs. Sometime later the list petered out.  I've now made the plunge and purchased a Windows machine and would really appreciate re-reading those archives.  Unfortunately (uncharacteristically), it looks like I didn't save any of that email, and I was wondering if anyone else has an archive of the list traffic.  I've searched www.scripting.com but without any luck. Do any other former subscribers has an archive of the list?<p>
