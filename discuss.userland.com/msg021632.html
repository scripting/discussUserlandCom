Fascinating discussion fellas...and difficult to tackle in limited bandwidth...In an earlier post, I believe Josh made a comment that it would be easier or more efficient to have posts be anonymous so that individual histories didn't muddy the water of the debate at hand. Fair enough--->kind of like Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ideas of Quality...but, the anonymity idea suffers because who we are has to do with what we have done, where we've been, in short, our history. <p>
So, learning vocabulary is largely a contextual experience---the clues and histories of where we have been are key. Further, even though it is messy and difficult and ineffecient getting some background---some context is key. Flames, while somewhat problematic and sometimes caused by misunderstanding are a part of life--that given folks who are highly evolved/evolving--->say the David Mccuskers (nice website btw) and Josh Allen's of the world exist...it is worth the effort to "know thyself" lurk a bit and take the good with the bad...<p>

<p>sorry to be a turd in the punchbowl guys. this is a really nice thread.
