Now, on to my question: I've been experimenting with XML on my <a href="http://portal.dandot.com/">personal portal</a>, using RDF and scriptingNews formats to syndicate content from other sites. It's working great!<p>

There are a few my.userland.com channels that I'd like to syndicate, but I don't have the URL for the XML source. Specifically, I'm interested in the headlines from The Motley Fool and the IMDB's USA Weekend Box Office. I've used <a href="http://www.xmltree.com/">XMLTree</a> to find the content I have so far, but I haven't been able to find these two.<p>

Can anyone point me in the right direction?
