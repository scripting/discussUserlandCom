RSS was orginally aimed to syndicate headlines. Since then we've found that it's very very near an XMLization of a weblog. Yet weblogs, just now and then, use the full power of HTML rather than stick to a format.<p>

There'll be a point (I think we're near it) when RSS "just works" and any more attention to it will make it too complicated to be used, as Dan fears.<p>

Maybe we're looking for a weblog DTD that has the same uptake potential as RSS does? And maybe because of Blogger, Manila, Zope and so on it won't matter if it's a teensy bit more complex underneath because people will be creating them via tools rather than by hand.<p>

It's a shame that XML namespaces create so much controversy, because the modularity they can bring would be really neat here, allowing applications and users simply to ignore what they can't grok.
