And they've fixed almost all of the annoyances of the VB language. Unfortunately, Studio 7 won't be out till late this year or early next year ( MS says late this year, ZDNet says early next year).<p>

I really liked one exchange between Ballmer and the other Microsoftie (Visual Studio Project Planner Dave Mendlen). It went something like this:<p>

Mendlen: ... and because this is all built on open standards, instead of calling a procedure written in VB on Windows 2000, you could call a procedure written in C++ on a Linux box.<p>

Ballmer: Of course, we'd prefer that you develop with VB and Windows 2000.<p>

Mendlen: But you could. [He grins]
