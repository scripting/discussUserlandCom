Hehe. That's a good one. If I create software, I have the right to so as I please with it, no? So why won't you let me give it away?<p>

<em>One can get work done with Microsoft Windows (though it is buggy, slow, and prone to crashes) without having access to the source.</em><p>

Perhaps they can get work done. But, as you point out, they cannot get work done well, they are not as productive as they could be were the code open source. Closed source software effectively harms many people's productivity. Is that right?<p>

In response to Red Hat: <em>Not a sustainable situation.</em><p>

But notice how you overlook ArsDigita -- a company that:<p>

<ul>
<li>Is making plenty of money, and is in no financial trouble</li>
<li>Voluntarily decided to make their code available under the GPL</li>
<li>Hires lots of programmers and pays them very well</li>
<li>And doesn't seem to have any problems</li>
</ul><p>

I think it is a sustainable situation -- you just overlook it.<p>

<em>These companies do not own the software they sell; in fact, they cannot create unique value due to the GPL.</em><p>

No, by their own choice they have decided to compete on a level playing field, for the betterment of all of society. They've decided to give up their proprietary advantage and instead try to do the best they can by competing on the grounds of features, functionality and price. Why can't you do the same, or are you afraid that you can't compete and so you must hold on to your special advantage?
