When there is a change, it reads the file, parses the XML and adds the stories to a Frontier object database <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$256">calendar</a> structure.<p>

Why would you want to add My.UserLand stories to your content system? Look at how I've done it on <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. I've included the most recent stories from Tomalak's Realm and Salon, Red Herring, Wired and Motley Fool. You see this kind of stuff popping up all over the web. My.UserLand has the most diverse set of channels that are available publicly and free of charge.<p>

It should be straightforward to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13652">create affiliates</a> in any content system or database scripting environment that can process XML.<p>

<a href="http://drmatt.userland.com/">Matt Neuburg</a>: "I am one of those people who abhors beta software, and who believes
in a clean install. I waited until Frontier 6.1 had shipped. I downloaded the clean 6.1 complete, and migrated my old data over to it, slowly and
carefully. This took all day, from dawn to dark. It was worth it. I recommend this approach, and although I have isolated some bugs, I very
very strongly recommend upgrading. This is a Better Frontier." <p>

In our world, no higher praise is possible. <p>

"I've been wanting to do an essay on the topic of cell towers, so I got out some pictures taken on my last trip to Philly earlier this year and scanned them in. (The driver did not take the pictures, but the car was moving.) This "tree", complete with fake leaves, is on the Garden State Parkway at mile 135."<p>

Murphy is my best teacher. Last night around midnight I restarted Nirvana, our most ancient server, but did it while it was running its overnight tasks. Shrugged my shoulders, quit for the day, came back in the morning and my world was hosed! I did a save-copy on every database that could be causing a problem, and the lights came back on. I learned my lesson. <i>I hope!</i>
