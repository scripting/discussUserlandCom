It's on his best-of collection Retrospectacle, and on his album 'The Golden Age Of Wireless'.<p>

<i>One of our submarines is missing tonight<BR>
Seems she ran aground on manoeuvres<BR>
One of our submarines<BR>
<BR>
A hungry heart<BR>
To regulate their breathing<BR>
One more night<BR>
the Winter Boys are freezing in their spam time<BR>
The Baltic moon<BR>
Along the northern seaboard<BR>
And down below<BR>
The Winter Boys are waiting for the storm<BR>
<BR>
Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye<BR>
Shallow water - channel and tide<BR>
<BR>
And I can trace my history<BR>
Down one generation to my home<BR>
In one of our submarines<BR>
One of our submarines<BR>
<BR>
The red light flicker, sonar weak<BR>
Air valves hissing open<BR>
Half her pressure blown away<BR>
Flounder in the ocean<BR>
See the Winter Boys<BR>
Drinking heavy water from a stone<BR>
<BR>
Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye<BR>
Shallow water - channel and tide<BR>
Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye<BR>
Tired illusion drown in the night<BR>
<BR>
And I can trace my history<BR>
Down one generation to my home<BR>
In one of our submarines<BR>
One of our submarines<BR>
One of our submarines<BR>
<BR>
One of our submarines is missing tonight<BR>
Seems she ran aground on manoeuveres<BR>
One of our submarines</i><p>

I suspect the 'spam time' bit is supposed to
be 'spam tin': 'the Winter Boys are freezing in their <i>spam tin</i>',
as if the sailors are packed into a small metal container.<p>

Also, Dolby uses the phrase "spam tin" in another song.<p>

(Then again, you'd think he'd catch a transcription error on his own site.)
