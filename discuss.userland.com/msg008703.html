That would be a plausible reason for locking out Microsoft's client, as well as others, once AOL realized the vulnerability.</blockquote><p>

OK, but why not state that instead of accusing Microsoft of having malicious intent?<p>

And why do it after publishing the protocol and even encouraging the development of third-party clients (such as <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$8696">Prodigy</a>'s and the <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$8685">Tcl/Tk and EMACS clients</a>)? Didn't those clients have to prompt users for ID and password?<p>

I still smell a rat here. AOL may have been OK with the idea of Unix and Linux hackers running their own freaky clients, complacently thinking that the Windows-using majority would still run AOL's client -- even to the point of running multiple IM clients, as I and others do.<p>

But as soon as their portal competitors made it possible to not have to run AOL Instant Messenger <i>at all</i>, they pulled the plug lest they be robbed of that advertising audience. This whole "security" thing is a smokescreen.
