Would I just use 127.0.0.1/RPC2........ ?<p>

Could I use this to test outlineDocument support?<p>

These are probably obvious questions, but their answer has interesting implications - it means I can really start testing/banging on getting xml-rpc support in my favorite client/scripting system (moz)
