dave has lots of readers, and i bet dave's site gets a good amount of trafic... (how much traffic do you get?) <p>

anyways, unless you too get lots of traffic, you are still a regular joe that the corporations can continue to abuse without any ill effect... even if you do publish it via your own DG, they wont be too concerned about your 5 or 10 or even 100 users that are reading it, because that leaves them with many million more to rip off...<p>

if it was the DG that gave him this power then there are many perl programmers with it too... and as far as i know not too many of them are getting help from the VP of Compaq...
