I'm still working on:<p>

<I>Base64<br>
You can use it to send and receive (8-bit) binary objects. They will be base64-encoded and enclosed within a base64 tag.</I><p>

What's an example of an 8-bit binary object?  I guess anything that doesn't fit anywhere else, probably.  Is that the general strategy?  base64 anything that doesn't fit elsewhere?<p>

<I>data-access object<br>
Again, not sure what this is...?</I><p>

Me neither.  I'm taking Jim's advice on that one (leaving it alone), or does that make it a candidate for base64?</br></br>
