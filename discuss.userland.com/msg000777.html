I'd require that the "turning point" be during this millenium. Jesus Christ did what he did long before, as did Saul of Tarsus (St. Paul). Similarly, Jefferson deflected history greatly during this millenium, even though the results of that deflection may continue to be felt for centuries to come, and even though he didn't do it in time to affect the whole millenium.
