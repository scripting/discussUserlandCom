I've never liked the "My Mother Could Do It" approach to software design. It's tricky. It reeks of sexism, masquerading as Love of Mother.

How about if we make it so simple anyone can do it? How about if it's just a matter of visiting a page and pasting in some text, and voila, an XMLization appears on the net?
