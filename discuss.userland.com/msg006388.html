I'd like to echo Dave's sentiment: I don't want a toolkit that I can use to build a solution, I just want the solution.<p>

Unix has traditionally had a very strong scripting culture; unfortunately the Unix definition of scripting is usually "passing arguments to programs when they start". You can use many small programs that evaluate their arguments, read some data on standard in, process it, and write the result to standard out. However, it just isn't possible to build GUI programs that way; GUI programs have to be long-running. Unix doesn't really have a coherent story for scripting long-running programs.
