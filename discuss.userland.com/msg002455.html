For my job, I've built a distributed real-time, cross platform system. The components of the system are based around COM and CORBA. It's vital that we use both synchronous and asynchronous RPC, as it allows certain design constructs that would be too complex/ugly to implement using synchronous RPC. Having not much luck with using DCOM, I implemented a simple text based RPC protocol that allows also for async RPC.<p>

XML-RPC sounds like the right standard to integrating our system - does it come with async RPC? Such a definition would be useful.<p>

regards,
Fuzz
