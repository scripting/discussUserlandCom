Pardon my ambiguity....I meant the GDB containing the website - as the GDB that has to be open. If it wasn't, although your "doctree" pointed to the GDB, Nirvana won't open the GDB and an error is sent back to the client.<p>

I recall a reference about Nirvana not requiring the website in a GDB to be open - that it would take care of it - but I can't find the reference, and I can't get that behaviour to work.<p>
