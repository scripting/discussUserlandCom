It's the only one that has caused me to bother asking the question about moving forward...<p>

The fact that Jabber people may be interested in meeting Frontier half-way I think would be attractive. There are a wide-range of clients forthcoming, a number of bridges, and a spec which is available to anyone. It may not be the best player, but it at least seems to be on the right team.<p>

I think that Jabber may help provide that common interface - hell, it's just XML. The fact that they offer a public interface which can interact with AIM and ICQ is a good sign. AOL can barely get their shit together enough to bridge these two and they own both! It's like Apple circa 1995...<p>

Jabber's XML specs seem reasonably well thought out. It would *really* benefit from XML-RPC or SOAP as they are standing right there and apparently would get a lot for free by adopting it. Should they do that, I would think that implementation in Frontier would be about as easy as can be expected.<p>

If Jeremie steers us on the XML-RPC or SOAP side, I'd be more than happy to dig in and do what I can to tie these two together... The only other party I'd really want to hear from is AOL - they own this market - but I have zero expectation that they'd be interested.
