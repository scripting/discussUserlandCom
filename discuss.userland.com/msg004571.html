This will really allow non-programmers to leverage mozilla. You could theoretically build a whole new kind of app that uses the gecko rendering engine and XUL to show the components.  It would not even have to have anything to do with a "browser".  For instance a web-ready editor :) Or an outline builder :)<p>

Here's one quote from the article:<p>

"There's a trend toward using Web-building languages rather than native code," LaGuardia said. "And we think this could
     really spark a programming revolution."<p>
