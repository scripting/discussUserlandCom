Egger said<p>

<i> Assume every webserver has ONE top-level site</i><p>

<i>For each path just make an address link in the top-level site to the gdb</i><p>

In fact, you don't even need a top level site. You just need a table holding the site names and the frontier address for those sites. The table can be in a GDB or in the Frontier.root. <p>

Each entry in the table is the name of the site with the value being either the address of the site (if it's a GDB based site) or a filespec if you're serving from files.<p>

You effectively have the "old" Doctree approach still available to you - you're using a table of addresses.<p>

To enable mainResponder to parse the URL's correctly, point config.mainresponder.domains.default at the GDB or table which holds the names and addresses/filespecs of the sites you want to run off your server.<p>

For me,  config.mainresponder.domains.default is @["C:\\Frontier\\Guest Databases\\www\\htmlInterfaces.root"]. I chose this root since it was supplied by userland as example code for manipulating data stored elsewhere - which is what most of my sites are.<p>

If I want to serve a site off the root of my server I simply put an entry in the htmlInterfaces root with the GDB address to the website.<p>

eg the entry "football" with the value @["C:\\Frontier\\Guest Databases\\www\\football.root"].Football.website  <p>

allows<p>

<a href="http://my.server.name/football/">http://my.server.name/football/</a> <p>

Alternatively the value could be a filespec value - such as C:\\Footy in which case, mainResponder would serve the file based website contained in the Footy folder at the root level of the C volume.<p>

You can point to sites anywhere - you could have a website in Frontier.root, or a static site that lives on a shared volume, and so on.<p>

The only gotcha is that if you're serving sites out of GDB's, the GDB holding the website must be open - mainresponder won't open it for you.<p>
