The only solution is to close all the web browsers running on the system, wait a few minutes, and try again.  This usually fixes it, but still, it's pretty frustrating.  I'm wondering if anyone else gets these errors and what I could do to fix them.<p>

I'm using Frontier 6 on Windows NT 4.0. <p>
