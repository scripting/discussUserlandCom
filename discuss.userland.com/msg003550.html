<i>The @Home residential service offering is designed for your personal use of the Internet. You may not use the @Home residential service for commercial purposes. You may not run a server in connection with the @Home residential service, nor may you provide network services to others via the @Home residential service. Examples of prohibited programs include, but are not limited to, mail, http, ftp, irc, dhcp servers, and multi-user interactive forums.</i><p>

As I see it, this would prohibit most of the reasons that I want a 24/7 net connection.<p>
