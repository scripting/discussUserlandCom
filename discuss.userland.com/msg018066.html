I'm sorry to read about your friend passing. Your photos of Jeru's ceremony were a precious glimpse into the lives Jeru touched. Lots of people who looked pleased to be out in the cold wind with each other.

Earlier this week I meant to point you to <a href="http://www.Legacy.com/">Legacy.com</a>, a small firm catering to the newspaper business. If you are a news site webmaster running classifieds, Legacy.com can syndicate your obits and death notices, include them in its nationwide searchable database, and even create memorial pages. <i>So you can spread that final meme after you're gone. </i><p>
