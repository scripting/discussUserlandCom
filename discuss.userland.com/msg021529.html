After some thought I've figured out what I feel about it.  I've been against the 1-Click patent from the first time I heard of it.  We've all been over that before--it's absurd.  But there was something right about Apple licensing 1-Click, I couldn't put my finger on it at first, but now I know what it is.<p>

1-Click as a trademark/brand makes sense even if the patent doesn't.  If apple is using the 1-Click process licensed from Amazon.com, then I know what I'm going to get if I shop from Apple.com.  And Jakob Neilson <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000806.html">repeatedly</a> <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/991128.html">talks</a> of the value of "knowing what you are going to get". <p>

My time is valuable, and if I don't have to spend time figuring out someone's e-commerce system because I already know it's 1-Click(tm) than that's a good thing.  It's worth it for Apple to pay for that, in order to let me know what I'm getting into (I figure Apple isn't actually paying for it, but you catch my drift).
