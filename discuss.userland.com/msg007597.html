This is good news!<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7596">Hadar Pedhazur</a>, the venture capitalist behind Digital Creations, explains why they open-sourced Zope. "As you already saw with the XML-RPC collaboration, we are more than willing to help in any reasonable way, and we hope that this effort on your part will be rewarded by many more people joining the UserLand fold!" <i>Excellent!</i><p>

<a href="http://my.userland.com/newstories">The New Stories Page</a> on My.UserLand.Com lists all the new stories contained on all the sites as the day goes by. Think of it as the Weblog of Weblogs. Now the new stuff comes one click closer to you. Less hunting around. More productive use of your time, and more exposure for the weblog editors who put the most effort into informing and entertaining.<p>

Viewed thru the New Stories page, it's clearly more fun if people support the "fat" ScriptingNews <a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$11">format</a> for syndication. You get a chance to pitch people a little, and provide context. It's even better if you include a thumbnail image. They make the New Stories Page look so pretty. I'll try to illustrate this later today. <p>

In a different context, if you're doing a My.UserLand.Com channel, you are now a Contributing Editor of a super-weblog. This is going to be an interesting dynamic. Before we give users the power to exclude channels, let's see how this page evolves. It's got a lot of people contributing to it! Probably more than any other weblog. Probably more than a lot of bigtime newspapers. This is the web in action. This is why the closed systems like Yahoo, Amazon and the NY Times don't stand a chance. <i>The web is powerful.</i><p>

See <a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$14">Automating Channel Syndication with Scripts</a> for sample source code for scripts that automate production of fat-format channels using popular scripting languages such as Perl, AppleScript, Java, and of course Frontier. <p>

<a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$15">With a new feature</a> introduced this morning, you can notify My.UserLand.Com that your channel has changed, and cause the system to reload it immediately instead of waiting for the top-of-the-hour scan.<p>

I'm tweaking this paragraph slightly to cause a new story to appear in the story list.
