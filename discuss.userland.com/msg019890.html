I'm more interested in getting to a solution than providing people a venue to vent at me. Guha deserved a chance to get his thoughts on the record here. You can continue to discuss whatever you want here, as long as you don't use other people as a foil or to vent your feelings; I choose to use FoRK to get to the core of the issues, for the reason that Edd mentioned in his post, the concern that I will do something here that he doesn't like. Here I can't handle personal attacks, over there, that's up to the moderators of that list.<p>

Re you thinking I'm being overly critical of Guha and RDF, that's your right. But it isn't going to change what I say, not one bit. And I invite you to look deeper, I haven't been critical of Guha. Show me what I said that's critical. (And what does critical mean anyway?)
