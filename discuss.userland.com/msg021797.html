To my surprise, since I really haven't told anyone much about it, there are 9 subscribers, but no conversation yet. <p>

I invite folks to come on by and help get things going. I am simply trying to facilitate the conversation by running the list; quite honestly, I'm not even sure where to start the conversation! It's a big topic.<p>
