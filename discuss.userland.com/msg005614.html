Of course, NATO won't do anything, because it will start the World War 3.<p>

But as you said, "where do you draw your line?"<p>

And, my answer is, sadly, it follows the rule of the animal kingdom --the weakness meat is eaten by the strongness. So, we are brave enough to bomb a little worm, but we won't touch a big dragon.<p>

As for effectiveness. Do you really believe that a peace talk will resolve the kind of thing? History has taught us that you wouldn't shake your hand with your enemy w/o a gun on your next hand. I really doubt that Milosovic will ever listen to us if there is no bombing at first.<p>

On the other hand, I am against war of any kind, from a boarder perspective, we are playing fire, and eventually it's going to kill ourselves (I am not talking about America, I am talking about the Planet Earth, which is for sales right now at eBay!)
