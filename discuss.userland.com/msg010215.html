BNF, of course, is an acronym for "Backus-Naur Form" (Backus and Naur are two of the authors of the Algol-60 report, and Naur is listed as the editor). <p>

<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/">John McCarthy</a> was the inventor of the Lisp programming language. His site contains several papers and references to the early history of Lisp, including the "original paper on Lisp", <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html">Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and 
their Computation by Machine (Part I)</a>, which contains a formal (but not BNF) specification for Lisp.<p>

The Algol-60 paper came out in 1963; McCarthy's paper is from 1960. Both were in the Communications of the ACM.
