<i>Is it just me, or is it universally galling to point at Wired now that Lycos has a pseudo-frame at the top of each page? Wired, like Netscape, is one of the emblems of the web. Lycos is an also-ran search engine. I'd prefer if it were the other way around.</i><p>

that's not entirely fair. i can remember a time Lycos and
WebCrawler were the only real game in town, and Lycos
seemed consistently more useful.<p>

and it <i>is</i> a very small pseudo-frame ..<p>
