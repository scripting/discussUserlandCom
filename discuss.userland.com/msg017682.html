Dave -- some great ideas here. There is a small flaw in your proposals,
though: what you suggest is worse off for the vast majority of consumers who
A) don't care what browser they use, just as long as it is already on their
hard disks and B) have a hard enough time getting everything configured on
their PCs already, without having to go off someplace and download
additional software and C) because they have gotten used to doing the same
tasks with the browser on both their desktops and over the Internet and
don't want to learn two different methods (yes, the browser is part of the
Windows OS, for better or worse).<p>

I would love to see more competition in the browser space, just to keep
Microsoft on track towards innovating. AOLscape isn't going to do it, for
reasons you mentioned. And splitting off BrowserCo is just a bad idea. I
wish I had a better one, however.<p>

<b>To which I responded</b><p>

David, we all will feel pain from whatever happens here. Three
possibilities:<p>

1. Microsoft wins on appeal, and continues to grab new markets using
dominance in older markets.<p>

2. Microsoft is split along the lines in the Jackson order, which leaves the
browser in the same company as Microsoft's web services, and Microsoft
continues to grab new markets using dominance in older markets.<p>

3. Something creative is done, to restore competition to the browser market
and to be sure that the next generation net-aware apps are not dominated by
Microsoft, so they can't grab new markets using dominance in older markets.<p>

We can't set everything right, no matter which choice, everyone feels pain,
but long-term, imho, we'll all be better off if there's a competitive
browser market.
