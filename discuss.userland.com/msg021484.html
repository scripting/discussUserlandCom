There may be some obscure cases where there are issues between versions, but I don't know of any. No additional software is required for this. A major design goal of the '97 series of Office file formats was to facilitate extensibility; Microsoft gave that as the primary reason for changing file formats between Office 95 and Office 97.<p>

Of course, Access is different in 97, 2000, and 2002. But I don't think there have ever been two consecutive versions of Access where the file format didn't change.
