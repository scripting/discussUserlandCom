Have you seen HTMLDoc? Both GUI and scriptable (unix and windows versions, not yet on mac).<p>

I don't know if this will suffice for generating the quality you need to output a thesis, but at least it's free. It takes HTML and generates either postscript or PDF. So you would have to go XML -> HTML -> PDF.<p>

Scriptable on Windows via command line options. You can create the proper HTML source file with Frontier, then tell HTMLDoc to process the file. I did something similar to create PostScript files that could be sent directly to a networked printer.<p>

HTMLDoc is slowly getting better, and knowledge of CSS is coming.<p>

I think Leonard Rosenthol is also working on a scripting dictionary for the Mac binary.
