One of the most important things that John Kennedy did when president was give us a common vision that most of the nation could rally behind without controversy (a man on the moon, blah blah).</i><p>

The funny is the way you answered. I think there's an interesting demonstration of a cultural issue. Be careful, what I am going to write, is not aggressive.<p>

Scripting News, as many forums driven by american people, is auto-american-centered. It's a major default from American people to maybe think that their world is the world. You wrote in your contribution "give us", "the nation" and I read with the right filter because the context and I know that you were american.<p>

"The man on the moon" was not a great unifying idea, it was the result of what we call in France "La Guerre Froide" (Cold War).<p>

They has there big ideas which are being born : The anti-mondialist movement is one of them. The Web will be another one. I'm very precautionnous with people that wants to rule the world (as Davos people).<p>

Fill the cultural, economic, technological gap between nations is a unifying idea. The means are divergent.<p>

If you are interested by the perception of a french guy for the presenditial campaign... hum... :-)... not really interesting. Same candidates, same politics. The differences, I mean, for french people, between Democrats and Republicans are nothing more than the differences between a conservative party (partie de droite) and a very conservative party (mostly extr&ecirc;me droite).<p>

Juste mes 5 centimes.... :)
