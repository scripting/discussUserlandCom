Yup--exactly.  I'm inviting all Builder.com attendees to help me write my site-- <a href="http://builderlive99.editthispage.com/">http://builderlive99.editthispage.com/</a> . This gets more people involved at a lower threshhold.<p>

Well, Dave, is you've finally brought the power of Frontier to the browser user. And I think Frontier gets people excited.   I've alway been excited by Frontier's power, but there is a learning curve.  Now, the curve may still be there, but I feel like you've finally installed an escalator! ;-)<p>
