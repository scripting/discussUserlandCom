These identify a particular service, and all xml-rpc requests contained within it are directed at that service.  All the responses generated by the service request are bundled in a <serviceResponse>.<p>

I hacked up a prototype in perl (using XML::Parser and Win32::OLE) in no time to dispatch serviceRequests to COM/OLE servers.  I could POST a <serviceRequest> to our server, and it would extract various image metadata from a collection of images and export it all to an Excel spreadsheet.<p>

Defining higher level services like this will also let us create a service registry.  The idea is that we'd use an XML schema like a type library or IDL file to describe what methods and properties are available on that service.  Our server could validate an incoming <serviceRequest> against its corresponding registry schema.  I haven't gotten around to building this part yet.
