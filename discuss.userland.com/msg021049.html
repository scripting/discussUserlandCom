Yes and no. ;-)<p>

First of all, do you really <i>want</i> to "route around" another programmer's licensing terms? As a programmer, I want to respect those terms, even when I think they're silly.<p>

But, yes, your suggestion has been tried before. It's been done in good faith, but it's also been done with the intent of screwing certain developers.<p>

<i>Unless it mentions something about runtime binding, but who the hell is Stallman going to sue?</i><p>

Stallman can only sue people who copy <i>his</i> code in violation of <i>his</i> license. And since the US copyright system is heavily biased in favor of authors, he'll probably win.<p>

<b>Another Way to Look at It</b><p>

Stallman is just another commercial, proprietary software developer with a really weird license. I have to obey Stallman's terms for using GCC, just like I have to obey your terms for using Frontier.<p>

If I pay you money for Frontier, I can run a copy on my server, and I can write UserTalk scripts. On the other hand, I <i>can't</i> distribute copies of Frontier, or republish the scripts in your ODB.<p>

GCC is similar. If I download a copy of GCC, I can use it to compile C programs. I can make copies of GCC for my friends. I can even create new versions of GCC. But I <i>can't</i> place any further restrictions on the copies I make, even if I add some new code of my own.<p>

Both licenses give me certain rights. Both licenses deny me other rights. And in my opinion, both licenses are honorable, fair and reasonable.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
