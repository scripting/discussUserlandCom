It's a story with elements both clearly right and clearly wrong.  They're mixed together in a soup of rhetoric that tastes better with a few howlers that season the flavor like pepper.<p>

This is a recipe for very confusing arguments based on the essay's content.  Anyone can attempt to disprove the entire thesis of the essay by picking out a part they don't like and trashing it.  When Able likes piece A, Cain can point to some ridiculous piece C with some (inappropriate) implication this undercuts A.<p>

Joshua Allen: <i> The ironies of "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" are pretty apparent</i><p>

I'm a cathedral kind of guy myself.  The bazaar hype made my life difficult.  Every concept has boths strengths and weaknesses, and I don't trash the bazaar advocates because I want to see their part of value be nurtured more.  But I want to trash them when it gets out of hand.  However, rather than trashing, it's more constructive to gently prune when appropriate.<p>

Joshua Allen: <i>
What bazaar have you seen that operates by high priests [... snip]</i><p>

Yes, it's not a bazaar when it's run by high priests.  There's always a problem when leaders emphasize how everyone is equal.  (Um, then why are you the leader?)<p>

Joshua Allen: <i>
Whatever. I think you would have to be blind to deny that anti-Microsoft sentiment is just about the only sentiment that the
               whole OSS community agrees on.</i><p>

I think anti-Microsoft sentiment is one of the few sentiments that
<i>nearly the entire computing industry</i> agrees on, not just the OSS community.  So this is not a distinguishing characteristic of OSS.
The anti-MS sentiment is largely a paranoid stance that aims to protect against expected incursions on any front that interests or threatens Microsoft.  The stance is necessary because it's insane to ignore them.<p>

But anti-whatever sentiments are seldom instrumental in motivating folks to bind together in constructive behavior, except perhaps in amplifying some other cohesion.  Constructive community behavior is normally caused by support for a creative goal, rather than a destructive one.
