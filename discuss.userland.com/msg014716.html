Do you have a system component or app that we can send text to and receive something back that represents an anti-aliased rendering of the text?<p>

If so, what format do you return? <p>

What operating system are you running on?<p>

Is it an app, a DLL, an INIT, or..?<p>

What kind of interface does it support? Apple Events? COM? <p>

There are lots of ways to plug into Frontier's website framework which is what Manila is built on, but first we have to understand, functionally, what your software does.
