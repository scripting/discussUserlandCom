"the USPTO is interested in obtaining public opinion as to whether patent examiners are identifying and applying the most pertinent prior art during the examination of a patent application, and if not, how the USPTO may be equipped to do so."<p>

They're taking testimony in San Francisco on June 28th, and in Arlington, VA on July 14th. Written comments can be submitted until August 2nd.<p>
