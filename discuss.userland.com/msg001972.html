Which is what they are trying to do.<p>

Reading Carmack's .plan files show him to be a smart man.  I enjoyed reading about his problem solving and development decisions--he's in at a level so much more detailed than scripting, yet there are similarities in how decisions are made, how to think about the future.<p>

I'm primarily a Mac user--it's refreshing to read the perspective of someone knowledgable about computer systems who is new to the Mac. I need to spend more time w/ Wintel, and learn about their boxes.  Hope to buy a Wintel machine sometime late this month, start doing COM and VB and Frontier.  Should be fun.<p>


Interesting bit on that page about his vegas experiences.  Do a search for 'vegas' and read it.
