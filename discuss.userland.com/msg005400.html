<i>For Win16 developers, it was a total rewrite, or being stuck with a crappy Win32s app that had no future (and Win32s was no freebee either).</i><p>

<i>This just isn't true. Developers did not have to rewrite their 16-bit apps to be able to run them under Win32. Sure it was attractive to do so, but 16-bit apps run on Microsoft OSs to this day.</i><p>

I didn't say 16 bit apps didn't run, I just said that not porting to 32-bit (long term) was a really bad idea.<p>

("Having no future" meant your app would not be competitive long term, not that it would only run on Win 3.1)<p>

And when you did go to Win32, it was a lot of work.  More so than MacOS-to-Carbon will need be.<p>
