There is a patent out there in the wild with my name on it, due to some work that I did in the past at a company. I personally do not like software (or process) patents at all, but could not do anything about the patent being granted (employment agreement when I was hired).<p>

But I have also written a relativly moderate ammount of what I consider open source software (a number of Linux USB drivers, and a <a href="http://www.kroah.com/linux-usb/">Linux USB device viewer</a> that is in a number of Linux distributions.) <p>

This is what I do in my free time, I write code and give it away to others. So to say that I can't say I write opensource software just because my name is on a patent that I didn't have control over, isn't a fair statement.<p>

p.s. The patent issue is just starting to come up at my <a href="http://www.wirex.com">current employer</a>. I'm finding that it is a hard argument to win against people who are used to the whole "it's a great honor to have a patent, and they are essential for a small company to survive" argument. But I'm still trying...
