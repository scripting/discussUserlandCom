No need to add custom proxies or type conversion layers; the standard interface just works right out of the box! <p>

>> But if you drop the type info from the wire protocol, you suddenly have to add type maps to the server and client ends to get things working.<p>

Note that is a corollary to the language design.  Languages that don't reuse the same operators to perform different functions (like using `+' to mean addition for numbers and concatenation for strings) can handle the type conversion with no problem.<p>

Unfortunately, when it comes to language-neutral protocol design you have to cater to the fact that four out of five languages can't handle the coercion automatically.  :-(
