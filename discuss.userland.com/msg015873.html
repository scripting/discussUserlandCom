I think they're still in shock from not freezing to death before the end of the game...<p>

After all they did throw back every <A HREF="http://www.yankees.com/">Yankees</A> home run. Things got kind of ugly in the bleachers when one guy tried to keep a Yankee home run ball. Eventually he threw it back.<p>

I'm an adopted Giants fan&amp;#151;I've only lived here for two years. I grew up in Colorado, where we didn't have a Major League team. We had to make due with minor league teams like the Denver Zephyrs, and the <A HREF="http://www.skysox.com/">Colorado Springs Sky Sox</A>. The <A HREF="http://www.coloradorockies.com/">Rockies</A> (baseball) didn't arrive until after I left the state and I moved to Manhattan...<p>

While living in <A HREF="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&addr=14+Horatio+Street&csz=Greenwich+Village%2C+NY+10014&Get%A0Map=Get+Map">Manhattan</A> I did attend several Yankees games. PacBell is pretty good for public transportation, but I think &amp;quot;the house that Ruth built&amp;quot; has it beat with three separate subway lines.<p>

I've also been to <A HREF="http://www.orioleparkatcamdenyards.com/">Oriole Park at Camden Yards</A>. It's definitely on par with PacBell Park.<p>

I've never been to <A HREF="http://www.coorsfield.com/">Coors Field</A>, but I hear that it's similar. The Quark crowd used to hang out at a dive called the Skyline Cafe. At the time it was in the middle of a warehouse district. Now it's just a couple of blocks from the stadium!
