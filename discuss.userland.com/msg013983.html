Our purpose is to set the MacBird software free, to decouple it from UserLand, to let it find its own place in the world, if it has one.<p>

We want it to be a purely positive thing. We are not using it to defeat or undermine any company, product, or person.<p>

<b>Discussion</b><p>

After some discussion here, Jacob Levy pointed us to the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT License</a>, which seems perfect for our needs.<p>
