months. I just finished a neat tool that controls the content at Perlxml.com. I guess people call this a Weblog, yes?<p>

Anyway, I'll probably be releasing the tool I use because it's
so darn simple to use and install. It's a simple Perl CGI script
where you enter new entries or change the current ones. It builds 
both the RSS file as well as the HTML for the page. Cool! I also submitted the channel to
my.userland.com, <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1533">http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1533</a><p>

I guess I could adapt it to make virtual Weblogs for those that
don't have Perl CGI access too. What do you think?<p>

Jonathan.
