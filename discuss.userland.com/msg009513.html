"The advent of Studio One is intriguing because it could herald a new era of Internet content. When TV was invented back in the 1940s and 1950s, most programming was created directly by advertisers. Large sponsors and their agencies all had radio and TV units that produced TV programming. The advertisers were completely integrated into the shows, down to the name, what's called "title sponsorship" today. Typically, a program would be called "The Lucky Strike Hour" or something similar, the sponsor being more important than the programming."
