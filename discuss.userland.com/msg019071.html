This is free software that works with an s-link controller, so that I can control a Sony CD Jukebox from my computer, set up playlists, search for songs, etc.<p>

It's at www.nirvis.com, the software is called "CDJ," and there's a screenshot of the program here<p>

The program is free, but I don't think you can do anything with it unless you have the hardware device they sell (that controls various IR and S-LINK and I-LINK devices -- really neat if you have need of that functionality BTW).<p>

As for the name, I just wanted to point out that the acronym is pregnant with possibilities:<p>

RU-Talking <p>
RU-Listening <p>
RU-alone (for the WAP version)<p>
