When I was in the professional sound business (this Napster craze has me reminiscing), we always had to do the obligatory "microphone check."<p>

Most of us used the word "test" (we wanted to hear those 'esses') and any other words containing 'test' (often of a male hormonal and glandular nature), but the boss always recited a poem. I never asked him what the title of it was, or who wrote it (well, if I did ask, it's long been forgotten) but I could always remember the first few lines, which I often use for a test phrase:
<blockquote>
          James James<br> 
          Morrison Morrison <br>
          Weatherby George Dupree <br>
          Took great <br>
          Care of his Mother, <br>
          Though he was only three. <br>

One day, 25 years later, it dawned on me  to search the internet for the text and now I know that this is the poem <i>Disobedience</i>, by A. A. Milne:<p>

<a href="http://www.crocker.com/~slinberg/poems/milne/disobedience.html">http://www.crocker.com/~slinberg/poems/milne/disobedience.html</a><p>

Oh sure, I could have figured this out years ago. I don't know why I didn't. Go figure. But this poem's tacked on my bulletin board now. I'm memorizing it.<p>

Just in case I need to do a sound check. ;-)
