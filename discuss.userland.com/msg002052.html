You can hear me thru your net connection? That's pretty amazing! ;-><p>

Go for it. I'd love to see JavaScript as an OSA component language.<p>

BTW, UserTalk is not available as a separate language on Windows as it is on the Mac. It really wouldn't buy you much because JavaScript is so close to UserTalk, syntax-wise. Not too many people use the language separate from the environment on the Mac, we really have come to think of Frontier as an environment that contains a scripting language, rather than a scripting language to appear inside of other environments.
