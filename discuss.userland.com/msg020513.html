And I wouldn't declare RMS to be the greatest programmer in the world, either. (He's certainly better than I am -- I'm not flaming here.) XEmacs forked off from Emacs over some technical issues (with some heated philosiphical issues thrown in for good measure). For a description, check out <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/About/XEmacsVsGNUemacs.html">http://www.xemacs.org/About/XEmacsVsGNUemacs.html</a> and questions 1.0.4 and 1.0.5 in the XEmacs FAQ (<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/faq/xemacs-faq.html#SEC7">http://www.xemacs.org/faq/xemacs-faq.html#SEC7</a>).
