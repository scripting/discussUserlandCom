Cheap web terminals that let you do word processing over the 
net are little different from the minicomputer based word
processing that was available in the early 80s.  I don't 
know how many remember how worthless they were - As soon as I 
could get a personal computer and get off the mini, I did it.<p>

Everyone is looking for a way to kill off MS, but virtually 
no one seems to really understand the non-technical reasons
why a personal system is so successful.  In particular, the 
folks at Sun seem to have a total lack of understanding about
how real people use computers.  They also seem to lack an 
understanding of how electronic communications works in the 
real world away from their office cubicles.  Only a miniscule
number of folks in the world have the networks that Sun has.
When I look at Sun's strategies, what I see is them aimlessly
looking for a way to kill MS so they can satisfy their egos -
the fact that they are not succeeding just makes them madder.<p>

The only possible scenario that makes reasonable sense is if some
one that truly understands real people adds the necessary stuff
to Linux to make it usable by real people, then MS may get bumped
off.  So far, the only folks that come close is Corel Linux.<p>

As far as the processors, economics is the overwhelming
determining factor of who is the winner - Unless Compaq either
can get the volume of Alpha up near the Intel CPUs or is willing
to sell each chip at a tremendous loss, Alpha has a very dim
future.<p>

The bottom lines are:<p>

  Software that does what people want, when they want it and 
  fast enough so they don't get frustrated, will beat all other
  types of software - people that are used to the speed of 
  applications on PCs won't put up with web based apps.<p>

  Other than in Enterprise offices, most people either have
  slow LANs or no LANs, meaning that web based apps will 
  be extremely slow - The broadband explosion to the home
  is a distant dream for most people.<p>

  The hardware business is all driven by economics - If you 
  can't afford to build or rent a FAB, and sell a lot of 
  the chips you make for a decent profit, then you will lose.
