It was well designed, but it just was never understood. Well ahead of it's time. AOLpress could not keep up with the IE/Navigator featuritis
1) Transparent Web page Editing: the server is the filesystem. No composer. Used POST/PUT to create web pages, with aliases to BROWSE directories using GET, and kept a site overview.
2) Site overview/Link updating: rename a page, links to that page update on all pages on the site (if you let it).<p>

3) multithreaded
4) server side scripting: highly configurable
5) database integrated<p>

The problem was AOLpress was a bit slow, and clunky, and web servers/page editing tools never adopted the net is the file system additude.
