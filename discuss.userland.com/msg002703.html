This is annoying because if someone has a misconfigured server, you can get them to fix it, but if you send out a content type because you want it treated as such, and the browser ignores you, there isn't much you can do about it.  (An example - you might want to send out html documents as text/plain so people can view them as text/plain in their browser if you are putting up exmaple documents for an online web course - IE will notice that they stuff looks like HTML and display it as such even though you have told it is plain text.)
