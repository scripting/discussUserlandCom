By the time it becomes a serious issue, the end-run around the security experts will have already happened.<p>

My parallel to "Let's keep an eye out for it" is "I can envision this happening, what can be done now to make sure it doesn't happen."  Issues of this nature have to be addressed in the early cycles of development because they often cannot be addressed, or addressed inexpensively, later in the cycle.  Addressing it may even be as simple as "Danger, Danger, never support incoming SOAP calls, use XYZ instead."  Issues of this scale also must be addressed by the spec writers and vendors, and not left to end users to work around.<p>

One alternative, as an example, is event notification.  Event messages contain simply "something happened" and it's implicit that it's the clients turn to do something.  Event messages can be clearly and simply specified, easily assessed from a security standpoint, and validated by security software (like firewalls or desktop security checkers).<p>

Restated, the point is to recognize the problem up front and make sure there are solutions available; preferebly long before it ever comes up as an issue.
