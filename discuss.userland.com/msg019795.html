I don't remember Andy H as being a great UI designer. This might be a case where someone is taking credit for other peoples' work.<p>

Or it could be that my memory is faulty (it happens!) or I didn't get the info right.<p>

But..<p>

The two total-Andy software projects I used in the early days of the Mac had pretty braindead UIs. One was Switcher, and the other was a Finder replacement.<p>

Switcher went somewhere, it became MultiFinder, and then was integrated in System 6 or 7.<p>

His Finder-replacement was laughably bad. <p>

Andy's unique contribution was that he understood the inner-workings of the Mac ROM better than anyone.<p>

Did he have a clue how to build UIs? Not as far as I know.<p>

Hope that's enough disclaimers, enough to at least provoke a list of beautiful UIs that Andy did, not team-mates of Andy.<p>

(And I know and love Susan Kare's work, but she's a graphics designer, again, as far as I know. UI design is another discipline entirely.)<p>

Maybe Bud Tribble is the UI guru?
