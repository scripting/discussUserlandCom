 1)  Some hardware - input stuff (keyboard, maybe a mouse),
     display of some kind, some local intelligence (CPU), a
     reasonable size scratch pad (memory) and possibly some
     "permanent" storage [sounds like PC hardware doesn't it -
     Actually that was what was in a 3270 terminal]<p>

 2)  Some sort of control software - To ensure that all the 
     hardware gets shared and managed properly an operating
     system-like software is needed - even a 3270 terminal
     had this.  The Java folks like to have everyone think
     that the OS is going away, when the reality is that Java
     either MUST have an OS running under it or MUST incorporate
     OS-like functions into Java [something that Sun and IBM just
     gave up on]<p>

 3)  Software to do what the user wants done - in a PC, this is
     local [some of it is bloated, but that just begs the question
     of why people don't buy better designed and targeted software].
     In a web thing this software is either downloaded [at far 
     slower speed that coming off a hard drive] and run on the user
     system or is run on the server [timeshared - a novel concept
     that has been around for only 30 years] and displayed on the 
     user system.  In either case, the performance will be worse
     than on a PC [an in depth architecture study of all the
     possible designs for user systems will clearly demonstrate this].<p>

As for the current designs for OSes and applications - they could 
both use some major improvements [the hardware designs could 
benefit from a complete redesign also].  Unfortuantely, the folks
that deeply understand the technology, appear to be the least capable of designing systems to be used by real human folks.  Technically,
Linux is great, but it needs a good human interface and the software
that is being produced is not really that much better than the 
existing stuff used on MS Windows.<p>

It would be interesting if a bunch of computer folks got togethor
and instead of trying to outdo each other technically they tried
to figure out how to make a more useful computer - it would take a 
lot of listening and would probably be the hardest think they 
ever attempted.<p>

BTW Dave, I agree that a lot of existing software is not great -
I have never found a good simple word processing package that
does just what I need and no more.
