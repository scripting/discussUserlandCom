In Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, Rosenfeld and Morville said:<p>

Don't paint your stop sign green just because it matches the color of a nearby building.<p>

This was in the context of the BODY tag's LINK, ALINK and VLINK attributes.  They (and other usability gurus) suggest that those colours not be interfered with unless absolutely necessary.... matching the colour of a nearby building (ie: graphic or logo) doesn't count.<p>
