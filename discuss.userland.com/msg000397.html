Another important way, but again, not a primary way of viewing information is over time. <p>

Every bit of data that enters our new system is cross-indexed in a calendar. The only publicly visible calendar is the one on the new home page, but there are a few other calendars scattered around. You'll see them appear in the user interface, still not exactly sure how or where.<p>

In the time view, you can easily find out what happened on a specific day, so for example if you know that Sun filed suit against Microsoft on 10/7/97, you might want to look at the Scripting News home page for that day:<p>
