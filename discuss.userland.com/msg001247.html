I learned Forth on an IMC700 (a microcomputer) and basically that's still the box I use it on most. It's fun to work with digital and analog inputs and outputs in Forth. I'm still looking for a free/cheap text-only Forth (the way we know it :) for the Mac with TCP-support. There are lotsa Forths for the Mac, like this4th, PocketForth (VERY GOOD!), and many more. look at <a href="http://www.forth.org/compilers.html">http://www.forth.org/compilers.html</a> <p>

Oh, and I've certainly played around with OF. it's fun to draw colored boxes in OF. Did you know there's a bricks-game written in OF-forth? <a href="http://www.machack.com/Hack98.html">http://www.machack.com/Hack98.html</a>
