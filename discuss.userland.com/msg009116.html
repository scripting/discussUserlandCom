Extraordinarily easy to implement -- essentially doing a kind of include with content from other sites.  You just do a <script src="http://etc.etc."></script>. You can see what it looks like on my site at <a href="http://www.wc.cc.va.us/facstaff/">http://www.wc.cc.va.us/facstaff/</a><p>

Strikes me that this could be an ideal application for all these weblogs.  I suspect that userland.com doesn't have the performance/bandwidth yet to support it, but if it did, it could be a central brokering point for sites sharing content.<p>

Not sure what the business model is, since typically the links on a weblog are not to the weblog site, but to somewhere else (it would be hard to count clicks since the linked sites aren't signed up)<p>
