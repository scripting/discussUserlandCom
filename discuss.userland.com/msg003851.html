(MacOS Rumors was the particular site that bugged me)<p>

<b>My Solution</b><p>

I render the current content in its permanent place at the same time I render it on the 'dynamic' page.<p>

At the bottom of my 'front' page, <a href="http://nowthis.com/log/">http://nowthis.com/log/</a>, I put the following (which is automatically generated each time I post):<p>

<blockquote>This page's content changes every few days. This particular entry's permanent home is: <a href="http://nowthis.com/log/1999/03/09.html">http://nowthis.com/log/1999/03/09.html</a></blockquote><p>

(with the URL changing each time, obviously)<p>

It's not hard to do.
