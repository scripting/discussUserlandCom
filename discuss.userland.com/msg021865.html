I'm flattered that he includes me as one of his mentors, along with Jakob Nielsen. But it <i>would</i> be interesting to see who we all look up to.<br><br>In a fit of idearrhea yesterday, I posted three messages on the Radio UserLand discussion group. In the <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$2767">first</a>, I ask what's the two-minute grab-you-by-the-collar feature in Radio UserLand? I think I know what it is, now the question is how to put in your face so you trip over it in minute one, and experience it in minute two, without requiring you to read the docs.<br><br>In the <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$2768">second post</a>, I recount the conversation with Doug Engelbart, and how much of it revolved about addressibility inside outlines. We have the problem fairly well licked for whole documents, but how to point <i>into</i> a document? Outline structure suggests one way to do it, but it has a big problem when the doc is reorganized. We will start simply, with labels on outline elements that are attributes.<br><br>I saved the <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$2766">best</a> for last. We've been noodling and fussing over a feature request from Stan Krute, he's looking for a way to share editing rights on outlines stored in the cloud. We took a few wrong turns, and came back to earth where we always do, Manila. The feature described in my post is now implemented in Manila, so my next project is to write a tutorial to show you how it works. That'll appear at the top of Scripting News when it's ready. It could be an interesting weekend since Manila now speaks "OPML", and that's the native format of Radio.<br><br>
