A bunch of people have already entered category information for their weblogs. You do it on the <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/prefs/">Prefs</a> page. Each category is a slash-delimited string. Your site can be in more than one category. Separate the different categories with commas. It's an IQ test. If you get the most points you win a tank. (A vague reference to the movie I saw yesterday afternoon.)<p>

How good or interesting the category browser is is entirely determined by the webloggers. You can negotiate with each other. Use the <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/discuss/">DG</a> on the WLM site. The hierarchy is entirely dynamic. If there ends up being nothing listed in a category, poof, it disappears. The structure is recalc'd every minute if anyone has changed their category information, so you can see the effect of your changes in real-time.<p>

Here's the <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/categories/Music/Art/Bay%20Area/Entertainment/Nightlife/San%20Francisco">deepest category</a> I've found so far.<p>

Of course there's a public <a href="http://static.userland.com/weblogMonitor/categories.xml">XMLization</a> of the category structure.<p>

<a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/">Dan Bricklin</a> bought a copy of Frontier 6.1. "When I actually placed the order (online, in private, with no one to share the moment with), it felt like I was pledging to public radio. A good feeling of paying back for what I've been getting. This was not a feeling of charity (I want to try the product), but it wasn't like a normal arm's length purchase either."<p>

I wrote a <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/fod/stories/storyReader$13">little essay</a> about Dan Bricklin on the home page, but then moved it off into the FOD website to make room for comments about categories and Weblog Monitor.<p>

<a href="http://pine.cs.yale.edu/blogs/scoops.html">Interesting</a>. The top four sites on the Scoop Index are Frontier sites. And the top one is so easy to work on that it's done by a robot. I have absolutely no idea what this proves.<p>

<a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/">Robot Wisdom</a>, which is not run by a robot, is way way down the list. Not sure what this proves either, except possibly that Jorn's barking about giving credit for links has scared anyone off from linking to anything he's already linked to. ";->"<p>
