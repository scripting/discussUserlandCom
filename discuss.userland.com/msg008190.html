If you guys have girlfriends or wives..<p>

Let's say your sweetie cooks a really great meal for you.<p>

She's watching you eat, and you're really enjoying it.<p>

But instead of saying "Honey, what a nice meal you made for me!" you say "Yuck! I hate pearl onions in my peas!" <p>

Then she takes the plate and dumps it on your head.<p>

<i>"What did I say?"</i><p>

PS: For extra credit, try quoting Jakob Nielsen saying it's wrong to put pearl onions in the peas.
