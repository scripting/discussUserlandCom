(They're not discussion groups, rather tables of emails from my personal mailbox and a couple of mailing lists)<p>

I've noticed a couple of things.<p>

1) It's not a good idea to have thousands of items in the root level of a database. It really slows down opening the database, since all of the names in the root are in the namespace. I've seen dramatic (10x) speed gains for opening a gdb by moving all of the messages to a subtable, then saving a copy.<p>

2) I'm generally using ~15 megs  of memory for frontier, as reported by the task manager.<p>

3) Building indicies for all the messages takes memory, since I'm effectively loading each table into memory. The same goes for moving or copying them into a subtable. I've run frontier up to 120+ meg memory usage indexing or otherwise messing with every one of the 6000 tables.<p>

4) Be <i>very</i> careful about the difference between @table and table. Passing a 65 meg guest database as a parameter is probably not what you ever want to do. It sucks up a lot of memory (200+ megs, all my real + virtual), then invariably waits a while, then tells me you can't do that to a table, take its address.<p>
