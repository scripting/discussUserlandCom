I'm writing the Feature List page for Radio UserLand. I hate it because I don't think people really read feature lists, and I have to put on a kind of stiff voice, but that's not really how I write. I also have to write some new pages to hang off this page and I'll link to them as they're ready.<br><br>	<a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$419">An early draft</a> of the docs for OurFavoriteSongs.Com. <br><br><b>P2P<a name="p2p">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/12#p2p" title="Permanent link to 'P2P' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I took a break and read this <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-2758911.html?tag=st.ne.1002.tgif.ni">News.Com story</a> about P2P and how the VCs are losing interest. As usual the reporter and the VCs are missing something important, technologically. <br><br>	Yes, Napster is a P2P product, largely because it puts both a client and server on the user's desktop. In the end when all this shakes out, that much will certainly be required of a P2P app. But I think there are other requirements. To be useful, it must also have an editor of some kind, an end-user editor, so you can easily share things <i>you</i> create. <br><br>	I like to use an outliner, that's why Radio UserLand is built around an outliner. That's why it's good at doing weblogs, hierarchic Yahoo-like HTML directories, music playlists, scripts, pull-down menus. There are a lot of hierarchies on the Web, basically we've created a framework that makes it easy to map those hierarchies on the outliner, and we've provided a few plug-ins that implement some good ones. There's room for lots more.<br><br>	But you could just as easily conceive a P2P product around a spreadsheet, then the interlinked documents would recalculate like a spreadsheet. I'd love to use a P2P spreadsheet, and with the right hooks, it wouldn't have to do all that Radio UserLand does, it could leverage off Radio UserLand through local interapplication hooks, through COM and Apple Events. It's now 2000 and machines run at 933 Mhz. We could start assuming the OS-level connections are fast. <br><br>	Making P2P work is like picking up seeds cast on the forest floor. It's an easy architecture to build now that our knowledge of networking is mature and the machines have gotten so big and fast, and we haven't (yet) forgotten how to make graphic user interface software. <br><br>	To think that all P2P software is Napster-like is to miss the point. I strongly believe (not a joke) that the P in P2P is people. Music is a great catalyst, it gets people talking, but it'll go a lot further than that. <br><br><b>Morning pointers<a name="morningPointers">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/12#morningPointers" title="Permanent link to 'Morning pointers' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Over the weekend <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/rss-dev/412">Jeff Barr</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.headlineviewer.com/">Headline Viewer</a>, said it really clearly. RSS is Really Simple Syndication. He's done so much to popularize RSS. He's worked with users on both ends. If RSS weren't so simple, it wouldn't be so popular. <br><br>	<a href="http://jeffbarr.editthispage.com">Jeff also</a> has an EditThisPage.Com weblog.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.worldlink.co.uk/">Lance</a> is back at work weblogging on the WorldLink site.<br><br>	I got some sympathy email because I got a minor flame from Richard Stallman. I don't need it, thanks. He's probably the one person on the Internet that irritates more people than me. I don't find him irritating, I actually sympathize with him. He's got a program, a philosophy, and people are always picking at it, and him, but he doesn't give in. He could get a job and become a Dilbert, or run a shop full of Dilberts, but I appreciate that he doesn't.

This is what I love about our group. It's one of the few places on the Internet where we can get personal in a safe way. I still am withholding, not telling my full story, but yesterday I was tempted, it almost felt safe enough. Being a public figure, to the extent that I am, I'm afraid of personal stuff being used against me. So I'll stay safe, and only say thanks to the people on the DG for having the courage to share their personal stories. Now you guys are leading me. That's a priviledge. Someday I'll tell you what this is about. It's incredibly synchronous.<br><br>	When I was a teenager I started an underground newspaper called BLADAUN, which was an acronym (of course) for Birth, Life And Death of An Underground Newspaper. (Underground newspapers were the weblogs of the early 1970s.)<br><br>
