But to have a seperation of church and state - client and server - backend and front end - is a maturity in Frontier that I'm sure we all appreciate.<p>

Of course Frontier will always be a powerful scripting environment at it's core, but for most people they want to know "Is it server software or client side stuff?"<p>

So having the seperation is great!<p>

Congrats!<p>

BTW Did you know James Joyce lived in Trieste and wrote both 'Ulysses' and 'Portrait of the Artist' here?
