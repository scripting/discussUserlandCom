Couple of kids out at Berkeley have cobbled together a way to robustly refer to moved webpages on the WWW. It seems to scale a little bit (reports of Inktomi running 1 billion pages with their approach), and it is "reverse compatible" with your current HREF schemes. <p>

have a web browser, web authoring tool, or other web-related software, I hope you support Robust Hyperlinks. Send announcements to
