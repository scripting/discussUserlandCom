Your posts continue to be offensive and rude. I truly respect your work and your opinions, but am having a very hard time believing that I can continue to particpate in anything you are associated with.<p>

I will continue to read your site and dicussion forum, but am going to focus my energies in areas that might be of some use, instead of trying to defend myself against your posts and ways of thinking. I'm sure many people feel the same. Good luck. I wish you the best in everything you do.
