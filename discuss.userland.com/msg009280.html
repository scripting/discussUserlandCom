The effect of a robots.txt file is to preclude the use of deep links. <p>

So go by the search engine criteria. If a search engine would blunder into your content while following the rules, it is deep linkable.  If you keep the search engines out, obviously you don't want deep linking (since that's what the search engines do).  (Has anyone checked to see if Universal's content is indexed in the major engines?)<p>

Now if it's smart to reject traffic coming into your site; well, that's another question.  I have my opinions, and they just happen to side with "Links are good".  This is probably some manifestation of Metcalfe's law. <p>
