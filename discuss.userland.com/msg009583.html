the first thing to say is that it was completely cloudy so nothing to see in the sky tho’ it did get dark, it was eeire and to see hundreds of flash bulbs going off up and down the coast was pretty impressive... the mirror box art installation added an extra dimension...<p>

meanwhile bt worked long and hard and finally got the isdn line on at 8pm the night before... well done bt!... (and i never thought i’d hear myself saying that so sincerely)...<p>

we encoded at 20kbps with a target frame rate of 2fps... quite a static picture image-wise, but that’s what happens with slow-motion dancers!...<p>

an archive of the event should be up on the server sometime this week...<p>

finally, an amusing footnote... this was a genuine art project on a small scale... imagine our surprise, then, when the police showed up having seen the event trailed on interFACE (<a href="htttp://interface.pirate-radio.co.uk">htttp://interface.pirate-radio.co.uk</a>) who provided the streams and normally carries dance music... they thought somebody was throwing an illegal dance party!... shows that plod is getting net savvy...
