Adobe has been building in automation support for Photoshop and many of their other products, but Adobe is also very stubborn when it comes to platform feature mis-match. Providing AS support to Illustrator leaves Windows users without similar functionality.<p>

For a company that was actively working to better penetrate the Windows market to simultaneously develop stronger features for it's non-Windows version sends a very difficult message for customers to accept. Adobe seems to instead have decided to roll their own automation solution for their products, which you see in Photoshop now.<p>

Perhaps now having VB mature on Windows and AS's future secured in Mac OS X makes it easier to officially support the OS level scripting with some measure of parity across platforms. This is far-and-away for me the feature worth upgrading to Ill 9 over, so it's too bad that Adobe isn't doing more with it.
