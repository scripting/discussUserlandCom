I have the same issue. In addition, I want to be able to easily apply custom formatting to stories and display them as "other news" in a website. Because of this, I've started work on a <a href='http://plugins.launchpoint.net/discuss/msgReader$93'>NewsWire plugin</a> to make this process very simple for Manila websites. Basically, the goal is to allow the Manila site ME to display news briefs from a selected list of My.Userland.com channels (or channels from another aggregator) as a sort of "other news" panel.<p>

Comments are most welcome.<p>
