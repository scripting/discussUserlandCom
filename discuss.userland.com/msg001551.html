In normal everyday work, those windows will stay closed unless you're interested in crawling around in the basement. The items in the glue scripts table for any app will be the verbs you'll call from your scripts. They will be documented on DocServer pages. And any time we're moving too slowly, you or someone else can publish your own tables of glue scripts, as has happened on the Mac for many apps.<p>

We're just getting started in the working relationship with Microsoft. It's very important to present a calm interface and be very careful about what we ask for. This is one area where I believe Microsoft deserves much credit. They put the Active Scripting Control interface in, we never asked for it, but it's a perfect fit for our environment and our philosophy.<p>

Look on the positive side, we can emulate ASPs in the Frontier web server environment! Can you imagine the possibilities for people who like that kind of stuff? That's where we should offer a choice, I think we have not very much to add to the syntax of scripting on Windows. Not the right business for us to be in. But if we can add content management to the ASP environment, we have something that a lot of people will want.
