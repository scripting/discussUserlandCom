We did a quick look at their interface, but it doesn't do what we need it to do. We need to be able to send it a song to play and have it either wait before returning or call back to us when the song is finished playing.</i><p>

Why do you need the return call? If you use a streaming server, rather than an on-demand server, you would just have to send an open URL command to your mp3 player.<p>

I did a quick hack of RU on Sunday to get it running on my mac. I replaced the responder with a streaming responder and then just sent an openURL appleEvent to SoundJam whenever I wanted to listen to the stream.<p>

I would bet that you could do something similar with WinAmp.
