Patents on business practices and software are.  Software patents allow you to patent things you never could before, just because they are software.  <p>

Lets take a checkbook.  <p>

I can patent the checkbook cover. 
I can patent the check-paper. 
I can patent the magnetic ink used on the paper.
But I can't patent the idea of a check.  <p>

In software, I can patent the entire concept of a computer based checkbook.  I don't have to patent an implimentation, I can patent the idea of a checkbook, which I could not do before, just because I implimented it in software.<p>

This is wrong.
