I'd have to do some digging before I knew how big a job was this, or what parts of it are essential and which are less so.<p>

A couple things:<p>

My intention in saying that sharing objects sounds nice was that if this were the default, people would have problems. I have no doubt that you yourself could manage it.<p>

I know that persistence of objects is important to you. The first point to make is that the current design gets Frontier users lots and lots of functionality. This is the way of development -- get the basics first. It may not get you everything, but it sure gets you alot.<p>

Once the basics are done, then we can think about what's missing, and rank the missing feature by importance and think about how best to implement the ones that should be implemented.<p>

You're telling me that persistence of objects is very important to you. What I would appreciate is your describing in this forum why this is so. I don't doubt that it is important to you, and potentially important to many other developers, but it would help me and other people if we could learn why this is important. You're the Windows scripting expert, so your explanations are valuable. Scenarios would help.<p>

The question is: why is persistence of objects more important than or equally as important as persistence of data?<p>

And here's a what-if: what if we extended the current design just enough so that you could return objects (object references, actually) to Frontier and pass them back to scripts? (The scripts would see them as objects.) Would this get you most of what you need? Or not? If it wouldn't do it for you, I trust you to say so, and I trust you'll explain why in terms this VBScript newbie can understand. Thanks!
