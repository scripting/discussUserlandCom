1) The table of the current day's messages uses the message number as the link to the message. Why not use the title of the message as the link to the message, as is the case on Usenet and other discussion boards? It seems slighly less friendly to use the message number, and maybe a little bit potentially confusing to people who are not used to computer BBS's. It seems more computery than friendly. I imagine that the reason might be that the message subjects aren't unique, and the numbers are. Still, I think the meaning is clear if one were to click on the subject, as one does in most other BBS's. A compromise might be to make the displayed title something like "Re: Napster Business Model [msg 12345].<p>

2) It would be nice for the author's name in the table to link to the author's profile.<p>

3) The "Ct" meaning isn't immediately clear. When I first looked at it, I wondered, "what is this, the number of replies? The number of reads?" Suggestion: Make the column heading clickable to bring up a small explanatory Window.
