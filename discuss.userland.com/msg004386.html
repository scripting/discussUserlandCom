Interesting. I remember the first time I saw the web.<p>

It was 1995, I was at work. We had just gotten T1 access but only to 2 machines in a common area. Most of us developer-types were already using late Win95 betas. We were pretty much fully moved over to 32-bit and developing our product for Win32. The 'net machines were one Win95 machine (Dell p90) and one Mac (not sure what specs).<p>

Sure the net was smaller. And things were grayer. But the trememdous potential just staggered me.<p>

For <i>years</i> I spent time carousing CompuServe and AOL for developer info. For help with this problem or that. Looking around on local BBSs and things even, which for professional C++ coder info was pretty lame. At least where I live it was.<p>

The web changed everything. Now I own very few programming reference books because the latest docs are always available online (I work mostly in Java these days). Everywhere I'm working, be it home or at work, I'm online with volumes of information.
