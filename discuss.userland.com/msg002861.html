Generating another format/layout is easy, and if by some stroke of bizarreness the cost of disk storage goes up enough that generating it per-request is necessary, most of us can do that too.<p>

I don't want to get bogged down in hundreds of formats, but I've no objection to supporting one for humans who've set up computers to assist them and one for humans who see the computer merely as a display tool. No matter what, I'll probably always have something that looks roughly right in Lynx anyway, so it's not like I expect this XML format to supplant HTML for my uses in the near-term.
