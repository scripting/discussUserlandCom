At the very least, right now you could have an invisible frame that was a tiny piece of Javascript that contained the timestamp of the last chat update, which was compared against a value stored in the parent frameset.<p>

That way you would refresh the tiny timestamp frame and only refresh the chat when new posts had been added.<p>
