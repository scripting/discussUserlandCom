I want you to know that nothing you said here decreases the likelihood of getting help from my company.<p>

I think your advice is good. I wouldn't do anything to change the kind of stuff Matt writes about. As I've said before he has a great appreciation for the software and can teach it, and a lot of people, including me, think his book is great and want more writing from Matt.<p>

We're going to address this one step at a time. I've read your message in detail and I promise you I will think about it and try to incorporate the advice in what we do.
