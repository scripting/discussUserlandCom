Two words why client side ActiveX is a bad idea when it comes to browser features: CROSS PLATFORM<p>

What about IE 4.x for the MacOS?<p>

I won't claim to know a lot about this area, but I've seen the words "Activex" in relationship to IE involving the Mac platform, but I've yet to see it in real life.<p>

Why do I always create DHTML, or HTML + JavaScript instead of Using more powerful ActiveX objects in HTML?   Cross Platform.<p>

I'd be more than happy to create compiled client side ActiveX objects using my familiar MS development environments and languages, but it doesn't do me any good when I can't even run it on more than one platform.<p>

Want to make me and a kajillian other web programers happy?
Bring ActiveX to the Mac version of IE...<p>


But i digress...back to the origional thread...<p>

Why make this an add-on?
Why can't MS simply make the already used <TEXTAREA> boxes more like the rich text boxes on windows?<p>

Granted, technically they ARE the same...but why make me [the web developer] jump through hoops to use it by the coding of ActiveX objects?
