These are things like CommerceXpert and PublishingXpert, which Netscape developed in conjunction with General Electric's EDI division.<p>

This stuff is Web-oriented work flow, and it's worth big bucks per installation.  This may not be sexy stuff to most of us, but Netscape has a bunch of people out selling this and services like Custom Netcenter to Fortune 500 companies.  From what I've seen, I'm convinced that some companies will buy these big $ products, and they will be profitable for the joint venture.<p>

Here's a question about Marc's experience for Dave Winer.  Do you think that Marc's exit at this stage was part of AOL's plan?  Couldn't it have been part of a strategy to retain critical elements of the Netscape staff through the transition?
