Your economic model seems to leave out a very important part of the equation...the consumer. It is the consumer who actually runs the engine of capitalism, not the distributors and middle men.<p>

It also leaves out the possibility of reward for inovators and risk-takers. In a system of patronage, such behavior is dangerous to both the patron and producer.<p>

As for service, support and cloning of software, it can be done cheaper outside the US.<p>

I guess the entire US software industry is dead. Software will be stuck firmly at the year 2000. Patronage will die. RMS will lose his grants. Poor us.<p>

I read once that history was dead too.
