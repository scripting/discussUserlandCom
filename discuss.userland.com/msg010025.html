There's no disclaimer on Dell's site or Compaq's warning me that they sell defective merchandise. Or that they're going to waste huge gobs of my time making me do a job I never signed up to do. They claim to ship computers that work, or at least they don't disclaim that they don't work<p>

And go check out www.scripting.com, I'm pointing to dealers that people recommend here, so if you have one that you like, let us know about it.<p>

And.. I know the value of a good dealer. Too bad I don't know any. The only dealer left around here is Fry's and that place is even worse than the websites. I used to buy stuff at Computer Plus in Sunnyvale, the owners became my friends and they even invested in my first company. I like to have a close relationship with a dealer. When and if I find one, you can be sure that I will sing their praises, as I do with our ISP, <a href="http://www.conxion.com/">Conxion</a>.<p>

And watch out when you have to put "it sounds like" in front of a statement. No, I don't want them to play VAR for free. Frankly what I really want is a mass-market computer, bought by hundreds of thousands of other people *before me*, so I don't have to play free beta tester and phone slave for the manufacturer. <p>

Thanks for listening.&trade;<p>

<i>Aside to Eric Kidd, this is what I mean about the English language not fostering good communication. Many people think that what something sounds like to them is indistinguishable from my having actually said it.</I>
