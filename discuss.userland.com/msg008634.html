I want the translucent pieces to be released in clear plastic.<p>

Then I can go in, using paint for lexan RC car bodies, and do a masterpiece on the inside.  I've done this with the rc cars, and they looked really good without too much skill. (orange-red fade, or light splatter with a black metallic base. Maybe a touch of mother of pearl white on the corner highlights.  possibly a flame job?) <p>

The reason that it works so well is that you're painting the inside, so you don't really have to worry about the quality of the paint surface.<p>
