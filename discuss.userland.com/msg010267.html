The most amazing concept that Frontier introduced to me, IMHO, was that you were programming in an outliner environment!
No more ending loops. No more adding a million comments all through the code to figure out where control structures begin and end.
And more importantly, drag-and-drop a headline instead of cut-and-paste a chunk of code.
Is there any other IDE out there that does the same for Perl and Java?<p>
