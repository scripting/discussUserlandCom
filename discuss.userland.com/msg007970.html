a) each item has its own html table, making for unnecessarily long rendering times (why not just a [p] tag to seperate each one?) and,<p>

b) when there are long headlines, they get overlap with the site's graphic, making them partially unreadable - this could be easily fixed by putting the graphic in a new column.<p>

also, the link to favorites seems to have disapeared from the navigation bar on the side, though I imagine this is for a reason.<p>

cheers,<p>
