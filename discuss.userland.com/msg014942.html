Yesterday afternoon I flew from London to Boston in perpetual sunset, following the sun from east to west. It didn't actually get dark until we slowed down on our descent into Boston. I was lucky to look out the window as we went over Greenland, what a hostile environment! Snow and mountains and not a single light or sign of civilization. I took a few pictures but none of them showed anything. I've got a <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/products/detailb.cfm?id=275">great camera</a>, but it's got limits.<p>

Two views of Boylston Street. In one <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$195">direction</a> (not sure if it's north or south) we see what a runner in the Boston Marathon would see as he or she approaches the finish line (one block past the Lenox Hotel) and in the other direction, the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$196">Hynes Convention Center</a>, where the Seybold Conference begins tomorrow. I was standing in front of a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$197">plaza</a> that makes today in Boston look very cold. (It is.)<p>

I spent most of the day in the hotel sleeping and trying to erase jetlag. I miss Europe. It's collld here.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14933">David Golding</a>: "Wahid may or may not be the leader his country needs, but he disturbs me as he has said he will pardon his top General if the man is convicted of crimes against humanity - in fact, he said it at Davos."<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14936">Robert Slotboom explains</a> what a broodje is. I miss them already. My favorite broodje is herring with pickle and onions. I also like the salads, salmon, tuna, egg. The Netherlands is a homey friendly country, and Amsterdam is a beautiful city. I love the way they talk. I vish I had stayed there long enough develop the accent. They almost sing while they talk. Very polite people, friendly to Americans with our booming voices. <p>

<a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/02/06">Dan Gillmor</a> is headed to Demo and I'm headed out the door for a walk in cold cold Boston. Dan can bring a jacket and maybe a sweater. I'm going to wear two sweaters, a leather jacket, gloves, a scarf, and long underwear. (And my digital camera, of course.)<p>

Between 6 and 7 I'm rehearsing my speech at the Hynes. I'll take some pics there, sort of a before and after. Liz Grady tells me they're doing a new stage for this Seybold. <i>1.0.</i><p>
