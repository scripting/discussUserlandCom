Sure.  Since copyright doesn't cover your ideas, nothing can
stop others from discussing your material in other forums.<p>

The point is that copyright <i>does</i> cover your right to present
your material in a proper way.  Public annotations probably
violates that... (it <i>clearly</i> violates that under some
copyright laws which has strong support for moral rights)<p>

<i>But theoretically, isn't there something potentially good
going on here?</i><p>

Sure.  And if Third Voice wanted, they could turn their
existing technology into a great thing: use an opt-in scheme,
and have their users pressure web masters to enable Third Voice
annotations on (portions of) their sites.
