I guess I would be a 2nd generation Harry Chapin fan (20 years old)... My parents would play Harry Chapin and Billy Joel albums on sunday afternoon when I was young, and several Chapin ballads (Taxi, Sequel, Sniper, Corey, Always 17) made a definite impresssion on me. (Although I was too young at the time to know what he meant by "Flying So High when he is stoned" in Taxi.)<p>

Unfortunately, I can't be an example of Dave's idea of a young person finding Harry's music on Napster — napster really lacks a way to explore music... to be effective, you really need to be looking for something specific... Mixing napster functionality with an Amazon.com-like reccomendation system would be great.<p>

I have found it most useful in finding interesting live pieces, covers, duets, and remixes (Nick Cave, Pearl Jam, and Concrete Blonde singing Cave's "Ship Song" live is pure gold).<p>

The artist that interests me the most at the moment is Nelly Furtado, who's song "Party's Just Begun" I first heard on the soundtrack to Brokedown Palace, and have gotten my hands on a prerelease of her debut album due out in September... you can hear some samples at www.whoanelly.com, and might be able to find "Party's Just Begun" on Napster. She has a very interesting mix of trip-hop,pop, and world music, and I reccomend her to just about anyone....<p>
