An ironic side-effect of the current RIP bill is that it wants to define an ISP as a <a href="http://www.stand.org.uk/ripnotes/">"public telecommunication system"</a>. I'm not enough of a lawyer (ie not one at all) to know whether that would defend them against being "publishers" in current defamation law, and to be honest I'd rather see the bill thrown out, but it's the sort of legal definition we need.<p>
