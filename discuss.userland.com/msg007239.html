I think you're right. I'd forgotten.<p>

Microsoft did back down on this, but then stuck a limit in the license. I don't know what the final status of this was, but I dug up the Tim O'Reilly piece. It's good.<p>

MS NT Workstation 4.0 Maintaining Limitations<br>

Microsoft's attempt to get the Internet
                         community to accept via a license agreement a limitation that
                         they clearly found repugnant when encoded in the software
                         seems like a dangerous trojan horse offering. If users accept
                         the license now, what is to stop Microsoft from coming back six
                         months or a year from now and setting limits in the software.
                         After all, by then they could say: "We're just enforcing it now,
                         that limit has been there for a long time--since NT
                         Workstation 4.0!"

You can dig up lots of articles and discussion on this. Google returned some good documents, but I couldn't find a definitive answer. Although I didn't look real hard. Here's my google search terms and a URL to the first 10 hits:<p>
