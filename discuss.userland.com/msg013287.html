(xmltr translates xml into html or other formats).<p>

Since xmltr was released in October 1998, I’ve had the opportunity to apply it in a number of website projects. From this experience has come ideas for improvements and refinements to xmltr.<p>

In addition, a number of users of xmltr have suggested changes and improvements.<p>

Before proceeding with a new release of xmltr, I’d like to present a summary of the changes being considered.<p>

Some of these changes may affect existing applications of xmltr, so I’d like to hear from any users who are concerned that any of the proposed changes might cause difficulties.<p>

Changes are being proposed in the areas of:<p>

-	Supporting multiple translation tables<p>

-	Revised handling of entity translation<p>

-	Translating the root node of a parse tree<p>

-	Change to naming of special entries in translation tables<p>

-	Caching of translation rules<p>

A detailed writeup about these proposed changes can be found at:<p>

Please read the detailed writeup and provide any feedback to me at: <a href="mailto:phowson@flexi.net.au">phowson@flexi.net.au</a><p>

Also, if there are any other specific changes you would like to see incorporated, please let me know.<p>
