I just made a small improvement. When you're reading a message, you can see all the messages that are responses to that message. So now you can walk the tree thru the message reader. <p>

I bet someone will ask to see the tree as a tree. Right? I can hear it coming!<p>

Hey, anyway, I still want to come up with a way to add stuff to this board and read messages from within Frontier, without using a web browser.<p>

Maybe some people here would like to play with that idea? If so, design an XML-RPC interface for this discussion board, even better, implement it and I'll run it here. I bet Josh Lucas will like this idea!<p>
