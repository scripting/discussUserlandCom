Since i needed 2 phone lines and ISDN [128k  24/7], the local phone company decided to run a new "snake" from the house the the pole...and I mean new..out of the box.<p>

Everything got hooked up and was all good as far as I thought.
I just swapped my new spids in for the old and everything was up again...<p>

Well..the next week turned into tech support hell...the connection was up and down all the time...but only during the day...
The phoner company tried to tell me that everytime I unplugged/power cycled/moved the ISDN router in my house...it screwed up the switch port at the CO and it had to manually be reset... <a href="mailto:NOT@#$%">NOT@#$%</a>

after 4 separate tickets and a few phone calls to some VPs [thnks for a friends tip on higher up numbers]...they sent out a tech...<p>

he came in side and test the wall port [that i wired from the outside box]...errors galore...<p>

he went to the outside box..errors galore [at least my wiring was off the hook!]<p>

Then he went to the main box a block down ..no errors [why he didn't check my pole first?...we laughed about it later]<p>

He we to another main box the other direction..no errors...<p>

So he came back and tested my pole..no errors?<p>

It turns out that 1 copper wire in the brand new snake they ran was bad...and to make matters worse..it only appeared during hot days...<p>

we switched to another pai..and haven't had a problem since...<p>

Now if they'de just get that DSL switch in the CO... :-P
