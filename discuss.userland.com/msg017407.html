Last year they were excellent in the Great American Music Hall &#150; I sat 2 tables away from the stage and was delighted by their musical talent for hours on end.<p>

Their tour schedule shows <strong><em>August 2nd, 2000</em></strong> as their next visit to San Francisco, but they're about to play in the UK, then France, then on to the US.
