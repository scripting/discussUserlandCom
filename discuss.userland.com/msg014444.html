As for "buying" my arguments, I haven't overstated the Mac user contribution...heck, I know a minority when I am one. I had only drawn attention to the fact the product IS cross-platform, but in its present incarnation, ONLY for Mac and Windows users and that there clearly exists a market for Linux users. This latter point you admit. Yes, you have limited development resources; yes, choose the shortest path for getting there. What's emotionally pressuring about that? I am, at this point, reminded of the Monty Python skit about "proper" arguments.<p>

Kam (<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14401">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14401</a>) was pointing out that almost everything that he has found for Intel-Linux could be be re-compiled for LinuxPPC (which draws A LOT from the Red Hat distribution). His question seems to hinge around the issue of emulation through the use of WINE to get things to work.<p>

Would you suggest that Emulation is a Good Thing on older, slower machines...machines which, if not reincarnated as Linux boxes, represent a lost market. On newer, faster boxes emulation is increasingly less of an issue. Will the use of WINE code to achieve a Linux port of Frontier positively preclude the porting of same to LinuxPPC? If yes, I am just as disappointed as Kam. If no, then GO FOR IT, post haste. I hope this isn't interpreted as speaking for Kam, but that was how I understood it: Why would I want to run an emulation if I've got a perfectly good Windows (or Mac...or Linux!) machine that runs the code natively?<p>

Skip Davos, man, get the code written (Just kidding; I'm grinning at the thought of you getting a haircut and putting on a white shirt and tie! Who's taking the photos? D_W_Does_Davos! dwdd.editthispage.com!).
