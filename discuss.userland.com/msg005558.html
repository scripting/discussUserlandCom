I used to feel that way too. But once Frontier was ported to Windows I made the transition in a couple of weeks. Windows seemed slightly strange for probably four or five months, but the strangeness felt nice. I tell my friends who use Windows that I use it as if it were a Mac. It's so true! <p>

I guess I had to get fed up with all the BS in the world around the Mac (the loser thing). Every bit of unfamiliarity was a reminder that I was escaping that. If I could be a winner by switching to NT, then switching was a good thing to do, even though it meant giving up MORE. As a writer, that was a big thing. MORE was my writing environment. But there's a silver lining. Now Frontier has a wrapping headlines outliner, runs on Mac and Windows, so my writing environment is now on Windows, and you all get the benefit of that too because the Frontier 6 outliner has it tooo.<p>

Of course right around the time I was being liberated by Windows "Linux" started to be the place the winners were. Just like the <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/08/macarena">Macarena</a>, I tend to be stubborn about making the move until it's the last moment. When I bought my copy the clerk at the record store said "Now you can be the last person on your block to get the Macarena." Hey the one time I was just in time was the Mac in 1984. At that time my stubborn streak paid off, we stuck with the Mac thru 1985 which was a very rough year, and in 1986 whent he Mac boomed, we were there. Those were the good days I remember. For two years, for me, the Mac was MagicLand. But I got even more stubborn, and remained a Mac user even when it hurt to be one.<p>

BTW, I'm not claiming that there are any universal truths here, we all have our threshhold of pain, some people even like fighting the "impossible" fight.
