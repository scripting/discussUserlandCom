I've been writing and giving away source long before I'd heard of GNU or the term "open source" came along, and while I agree with some of the intents behind "open source" licenses, I'd rather wish I didn't have to be bothered by them to write and give away source.  Since the term "Open Source" is used with such disparagement in your writing and in these forums, I would be very leary of answering "yes" to whether or not I'm what you'd call an "Open Source" developer.
