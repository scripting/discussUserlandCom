I mean lets be honest SAP was never going to work to solve these problems because of its blind way of avoiding solving the CMS problem in the first place..and now business are looking for a way to tie in all these web apps piecemeal into a CMS system..why can't Frontier be that CMS solution?<p>

Think about it we can tie in every web app that uses XML-RPC, we can tie in databses of inventories and orders..so how about asn anyone else pushing towards this goal?  and why are you pushing towards this goal..what do you see in the future ten months that persuaded you to look at this possibility?
