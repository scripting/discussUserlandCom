Actually, that was a total brain misfire on my part.  I more or less meant all software, commercial, shareware, open source, whatever.  The crossed circuit in my head was I remembered getting all sorts of email from shareware people complaining about it, even though I know everyone either routed around (painfully, nee PNG) or had to cough up.<p>

MP3 & Vorbis sound like a similar issue to GIF & PNG.  This is the first I've heard of it (ok, meaningless... ;).  Looking at their site, it looks like Vorbis requires you to certify with them to claim compatibility.  So, what do I say my app supports if I don't certify?  Is it really open source to say that?<p>

The bit about MP3 encoding is interesting, however.  Is this a GIF problem in the making?<p>

Hmm.<p>
