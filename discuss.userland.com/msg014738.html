SVG will still depend on the UA to antialias text, which in a lot of cases will depend on the OS for that. Manila should leave it to the OS as well. Flash is great and all, but since you can't really edit binary files in Notepad, it's best to just skip over it. For really readable text, at any size--huge or tiny--ClearType is perfect for that. Manila e-Books! Can't wait.
