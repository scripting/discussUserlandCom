In an email to the CEOs of Red Hat and VA Systems, Tim O'Reilly said:<p>

<blockquote>"I don't know if you're plugged in to the XML world, or if it plays any role in your plans, but if it does, I'd love to hook up someone from your organization with Dave.  XML-RPC is, in my mind, one of the key technologies for the "infoware" layer that I keep talking about.  It enables easy data exchange between web sites, and helps make the web itself into a development API."</blockquote><p>

<b>Tim provided air cover</b><p>

If you can help with either of those companies, esp if you work there in a research capacity, please send me a private email or post a response here. We're doing business openly because that's a good way to do it, and it will help us get fast results. Think of it this way, Tim provided the air cover, now we have to find the ground troops. It takes both to make something happen.<p>

<b>The goal is to get:</b><p>

<ul>
<li>A commitment to include an <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> client and server with their Linux distribution, and<p>

<li>A public statement about that next week.
</ul><p>


Of course other Linux distributors and opinion leaders' support is totally welcome. We want the open source world to take ownership of XML-RPC. It's already *part* of the open source world, thru Python, Tcl, Perl, PHP, etc. But it would be incredible to know that every Red Hat server, for example, comes with an easy to turn on XML-RPC server. It would foster a whole new level of development of compatible editors, databases, content management systems, syndicators and aggregators, and things we haven't even thought of yet. <p>

So now's the time, let's try it a new way. Fan out and find the right people and ask them in a respectful way for their support.<p>
