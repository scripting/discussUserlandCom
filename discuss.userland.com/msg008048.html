I was working on a similar format which youcan see an example of <a href="http://alchemy.openjava.org/alchemyrss-e.xml" title="RSS Enhanced">here</a>, the only real difference is that I'd called the content area <body&gt; instead. I've already tested this with my.userland and there were no problems. my.netscape wouldn't accept it. <p>

I would like to see more HTML elements allowable, perhaps <a&gt;,<i&gt;,<b&gt;,<strong&gt;,<em&gt;<span&gt;,<br&gt; (XHTML version i.e. <br /&gt;).<p>

I can easily change RSS Maker to produce channels in this format or the older format.<p>
