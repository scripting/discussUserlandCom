They cite a cost of $80 for a copy of Linux and then compare that to Giga group's $970 - $1,640 per computer Win 2000 upgrade figure.  The problem is that the first figure is for a copy of the software while the second figure includes hardware upgrade costs.  Windows NT is undoubtedly more expensive as you have to buy a copy for every machine you install it on whereas the $80 copy of Linux can be installed on as many machines as you would like.  That is how USAT should have made their point, correctly.  Instead they obfuscate things with their apples to oranges comparison.<p>
