<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,38129,00.html">agreed</a> to jointly recommend to Congress that a clause in the current copyright law that defines music recordings as a "work-for-hire". This clause would prevent rights to the work from reverting to the artists after 35 years. Apparently in order to avoid having another PR fiasco on their hands and a likely loss in court, the RIAA is changing its tune here.<p>

Curiously, the RIAA claims to represent artists. Why then would it have to agree with (unnamed) artist groups to do this? Er, is it me or is it me? :)
