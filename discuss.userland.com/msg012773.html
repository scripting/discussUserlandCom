"The fight with Microsoft is about whether or not we will all be Windows Developers. That fight is now over, completely. Microsoft had dominance in this dimension for at most three years. The Internet wiped the slate completely clean in 1993."<p>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/yr/mo/biztech/articles/07assess.html">NY Times</a>: "For more than a year, the Microsoft Corporation has been untarnished on Wall Street and on Main Street from the government's relentless antitrust assault on the company. But suddenly, it may begin feeling some pain as investors and the computer industry consider the likely impact of the blow delivered on Friday evening by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson."<p>

<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/11/06/open_source/index.html">Tim O'Reilly in Salon</a>: "The frontier of innovation has moved beyond the sphere that Microsoft controls. I think there is more competition for Microsoft now than there has ever been."<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$12776">Doc Searls</a>: "But when they got fixated on the semi in the rear view mirror -- Microsoft bearing down on them -- they missed their turn and flew off the cliff."<p>

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/10/27/think">10/27/98</a>: "It's true that software company death happens all the time in Silicon Valley, and often Microsoft is somewhere near the corpse at the time of its demise, but it's totally unscientific to conclude that Microsoft is responsible. If you field an inadequate team to play against a professional team with deep experience and deep pockets, and the other guys win, are they to blame?"<p>

<a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/1999/11/05">Dan Gillmor</a>: "In the shorter term, the trial has already had a useful effect. It has forced Microsoft to back away from some of its most outrageous abuses. PC manufacturers, for example, have been given more leeway in the way they set up their systems."<p>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/editorial/06sat1.html">NY Times</a>: "Microsoft should fight for its rights under the law, but it should also recognize the sweeping nature of the government's victory. Certain facts about its behavior have now been established, and it is in everyone's best interest to achieve a solution."<p>

<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/microsoftRulingDiscuss/discuss/msgReader$16">Dave Winer</a>: "If we don't trust the Internet to route around Microsoft's attempts to own it, how can we trust it to route around earthquakes, nuclear bombs and political despotism?"<p>

Red Herring: <a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/1999/1106/inv-cobaltipo.html?id=userland">Cobalt Burns Hotter than Red Hat</a>. "Cobalt opened at $140 per share and blazed to a high on the day of $158 per share, before dimming to a close of $128. Ultimately, it shot up a whopping 482 percent on 10.9 million shares traded."<p>

Red Herring: <a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/1999/1106/vc-vcps.html?id=userland">Alan Meckler Wants to do Deals</a>. "When I asked him where I should have entrepreneurs send queries, he said to have them email him directly. So, here it is, folks. Do your damndest. We'll soon find out if Mr. Meckler can keep 100 balls in the air. Write to him at ameckler@internet.com."<p>
