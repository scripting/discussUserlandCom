I don't think there is a global VBScript context.  Each instance of the Script Control, and each instance of the ActiveX Scripting Interface running in other apps has it's own global namespace.  That's a good thing, but it also makes things more difficult.<p>

Does each VBScript run in Frontier get it's own Script Control instance, or do they share one?  If they share one instance, you should be able to share objects between threads.<p>
