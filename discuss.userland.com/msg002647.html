Very nice. I think it makes total sense to do it this way too. <p>

If Marc Canter and David Shinpaugh from Venue Media are listening, this is what's going on. I'm working on XML-RPC handlers now for the MTTF application. You'll call those handlers from JavaScript by calling a control, that will either be written in Java or will be a wrapper on the Microsoft control I pointed to earlier today. And that will give you the ability to connect the server database to the object classes you've written to run in the browser.<p>

That's the plan, from the plumbing side of things. And at the same time Bernie and Jimmi are coming for an all-day meeting to talk about groupware for Technography. We'll be using the same technology here for sure.
