The most widely used PC compiler is commercial.  It is Visual Basic from Microsoft.<p>


The compiler that compiled the most lines of source code last year (1999) was the IBM COBOL compiler on its OS/390 mainframes, also a commercial product.<p>


The compilers for the embedded system space is a very hotly contested market and almost entirely commercial.<p>


The Macintosh market is owned by MetroWerks with a set of commercial compilers.<p>


The compilers used to develop for the PDA market, be it Palm or Windows CE is dominated by commercial compilers.<p>


The compilers for the Game Console market is dominated by commercial compilers.<p>


Each major UNIX vendor, Sun for Solaris, HP for HPUX and IBM for AIX has a commercial compiler that is the dominant compiler for their OS.<p>


The only space that has been "devastated" appears to be the non-commercial Unix markets.  It is not suprising that a free compiler would be dominant on a free OS.
