(Manila Edited Static Server).<p>

When this ships, we are renewing!<p>

We use Frontier to edit static pages with lots of PHP and it is all served with Apache.  We also really heavily on UserTalk scripting to write a lot of PHP code and to manage navigation and what have.  But all this requires we don't serve with Frontier.  We use various combinations of WebEdit and Subscriptions, but editing static pages in Manila sounds much better.  If I correctly understand Dave, we're going to get the best of both worlds.  No one else gives us that.  Ha!<p>

Also, what about Twister ("An Amazing Twist in Web Conent Creation and Control") as a name for the feature?  I guess there would be legal trouble, but it seems that the functionality of MESS is like twister, something that needs careful balance because it is a combination of several approaches that allows for maximum user flexibility.<p>

Thanks!  We've been waiting to see how we could leverage Manila, and now I see that soon the produce will be a must have.<p>
