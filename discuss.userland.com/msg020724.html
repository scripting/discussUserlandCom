Yes, that's a good characterization.  And I respect just how
anti-closed/proprietary it really is -- very cleverly and admirably so.<p>

I'm not really anti GPL myself.  It's just an inconvenient cost to consider disclosing anything I do with otherwise freely available software.  This extra cost makes the difference for me, since I avoid looking at GPL'd software for ideas.  It's a simple expedient for routing around the nuisance of contaminating my research with obligations I had not intended.
