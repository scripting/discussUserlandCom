I am hoping to get Frontier to beta stage soon. I am going to push hard on it. However, the last few bugs I am up against are nasty memory ones and can be very difficult to predict when they will be finished. It is also hard because the tools I am using are also beta tools on a beta OS. When I find a strange bug, I end up asking, "Whose bugs is this?"<p>

Anyhow, that is the price you pay on the bleeding edge. I will keep people posted.
