Since then, I've bought about 20 machines from them. All have come with OS installed, ready to turn on and get to work. If I have had trouble with a Debco machine, I've just hauled the box into their shop and they've gotten right on it. They've been most sensitive to my needs; if the machine in trouble was in a mission-critical role, they've given it top priority, and I've almost always been back in business within 6-12 hours. If anyone in the Cincinnati area is looking for a reliable clone maker, who stands behind the machines he builds, I'd recommend a call to Tom Case at Debco.<p>

On the other hand, I've installed four NT server systems now, and last year I quit that business; nothing is worth that frustration.
