I really am interested in any objective facts or data that you might have to back up the many claims you make about what "most people think".  Once again I'd like to point to the "stop treating me like I'm stupid" as support of my claim of widespread perceived arrogance.  Nobody said you were stupid, and it's really hard to discuss anything with someone who is so sensitive about being considered stupid.
<p>
And I know you're going to take this the wrong way, but I am sure if you have some objective data about what features people want in a product, the Microsoft product groups would be very happy to use your feedback (or even hire you as a program manager).  Designing feature sets really does follow a rigorous and scientific feedback process.  I know you have some strong opinions about what people think and want -- we usually try to validate our perceptions in some scientific manner; I trust that you have done the same..
