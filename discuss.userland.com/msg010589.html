I think there's a way to do this and have a very elegant product that's relatively foolproof. Kind of like the Qube, but instead of being for the server, put a keyboard and a flat-panel on it, and build a really simple net interface. <p>

Writing and pictures to start. Add a few other types later. I think it's a big area. Today's machines have a lot more RAM to burn and hard disks are cheap, and the last barrier is the operating system.<p>

I'll tell you this much, I personally want it to be a lot simpler and faster to write electronically. All the software I use now sucks in one way or another. I think it can be much better.
