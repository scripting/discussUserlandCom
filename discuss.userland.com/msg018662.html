Then Gnutella couldn't know when WinAmp is finished playing the song. What we're trying to get is a rock-solid reliable way to play MP3s in sequence, a sequence that's under program control (and therefore under the user's control). Now I wish Napster were open source. That would be incredible. I've never heard anyone ask about making the Napster client open source. Rambling.
