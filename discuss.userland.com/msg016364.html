If connectivity providers start getting annoyed and shut down Userland for things said on Scripting News, they could equally well be annoyed at my site, <A HREF="http://brdbrain.editthispage.com">BirdBrain's Nest</A>, or any of the other 'logs where we complained to one degree or another about the connection issues and proceed to demand that those 'logs be censored.<p>

It's easy to say one cares about integrity, it's quite another thing to follow through on it when it becomes difficult.<p>

A toast!  To the man who by standing for one stands for all, long may his connection be uninterrupted and swift may his connection be! "qbullet.smiley"
