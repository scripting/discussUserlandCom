Me too.<p>


<i>For the last message retrieved by a user, would it be possible to store either the message number or the date? I don't know if makes sense to update the cookie or keep it server side. Wouldn't this allow nirvana to place the user on a page where he/she can pick up where they left off?</i><p>

I don't think this software has any concept of what you've read and what you haven't.  The only thing that knows this information is your browser -- and it will forget it eventually.<p>

It <i>could</i> be done by the discussion software, but doing it properly isn't trivial.  A simple "highest message number you've ever read" would be easy, but that produces problems if you, for example, are way behind and you read the replies to a message before continuing in sequential order.  Or if you follow a pointer from Scripting News and it's way ahead of what you've read up to.<p>

On the other hand, keeping explicit track of the read/unread status of every message in the databse, for every person, is going to be expensive.
