<i>I do think that VA/Research promises developer class machines that work when they are turned on.</i><p>

I've heard that <a href="http://www.valinux.com/">VA</a> supports their high-end machines very well. They handle tech support in-house, and they assume that their customers have a clue about computers.<p>
