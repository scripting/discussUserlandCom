(do they still do that? I haven't used AOL for a long time)<p>

The idea is to give the user who cancelled his/her account a chance to gain access to their previous username if they later decided to reactivate his/her account.<p>

I don't know if this is the reason why Hotmail didn't disable the account after an user sign off, but it's probably related. On the other hand, I don't think it's very difficult to disable one's Hotmail account, yet keep his/her username for a limited period of time. However, it's possible that this is just a mistake when developing the software.
