Tasks should be able to increase (and decrease) the amount of memory allocated to the program, based on the needs of that program at runtime.  Ironically MacOS 6 w/MultiFinder did this correctly.<p>

Every programmer needs to be disciplined in the use of memory, but that does not excuse the OS from the need to do it right.<p>
