Not as long as you're in the position of having to take sole responsibility for determining what is noteworthy. It's an old paradigm and disempowers everyone. And you're not going to be able to shift that particular paridigm by yourself.<p>

The technography solution is based on creating a shared space and a shared responsibility for making that space reflect the collected knowledge / wisdom of the group. You, as technographer, act as conduit to that space. You turn the authority for determining what goes into that space back to the authors. In your role of hyper-active listener, you help the group listen to itself.<p>

A laptop would work, if it were connected to a large monitor or projected on a large screen. Sketches, drawings can be integrated later, via digital camera. The outliner, once it becomes, via your skilled hands, a group tool, allows you to manage and structure the ideas being generated into a cohesive whole. It is a fanstastically successful tool for supporting collaboration, but collaboration can't happen if you're the only one supporting it.<p>

Yours for Better Meetings<p>
