<a href="http://www.webdevelopersjournal.com/archive/canter.html">Web Developers Journal interviewed</a> Marc Canter in 1995. Great soundbites. Like this: "Where I'm shooting at is where they will end up at in 5 years. So I'd like to say that the set top box, which is the supposed platform that will be out there for the info-highway, would have 16MB RAM, and 100 MIPS processor, and DSP and MIDI built in, with real time streaming video. That is something we could target well to the end of this century. That is something that will be a decent platform to start from." <i>16MB?</i><p>

Bernie DeKoven: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$4405">Dynamic Templates</a>. "Keeping the agenda items as the top level in an outline allows participants to expand (add subheadings to) any item, and then collapse the outline to an agenda-level view. This way, no matter how deep and detailed a discussion becomes, we can instantly refocus.."<p>

<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/stories/4263.html">Richard Stallman comments</a> on Apple's open source license. "...only part of MacOS is being released under the APSL--and it is the lowest level part. The only practical use for this code is to run the non-free part of MacOS." It's understandable that he would find this confusing. It is not the underpinnings of the MacOS that Apple released. It's the underpinnings of another OS, one with far fewer users and developers. <p>
