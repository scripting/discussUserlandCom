To me, this just reflects the fact that there's really no such thing as a "developer conference" at all. Any truly technical conference that reaches a certain critical mass (vs., say, MacHack) is invariably coopted by the business side of the house, who are constitutionally unable to see the value in spending all that money putting on a show that's run by geeks, for geeks with little or no business presence. Otherwise they wouldn't be in the business side of the house! To me, it's very reminiscent of the self-upholding nature of our National Security State or, more generally, the gradual drift that all bureaucracies show from their goal being whatever their goal is to their goal being self-preservation.
