I realize that I'm just reiterating the requests made elsewhere, but some simple[*] user feedback:<p>

First, a link to the discussion group root from the Scripting News pages, maybe up there next to the "Home Archives Directory ..." links. Checking the discussion server is a natural sequel to checking <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">http://www.scripting.com/</a>, and bookmarks get cluttered quickly and I'm not likely to remember the URL of the discussion group root off the top of my head.<p>

Likewise, on all message reading pages a link to /discussiongroup.root/ so I don't have to trim the URL manually.<p>

Finally (yes, it ends eventually), and most technically demanding, it seems that when I follow a link from Scripting News to a message it doesn't go check my cookie, and so won't let me follow up 'til I go to the /discussiongroup.root/ and back to the message.<p>

On the other hand, maybe the last one is a good thing, as it enforces a little context on the reader.<p>

[*] Whether the "simple" refers to the user, the feedback, or the severity of the changes requested is left as an exercise for the reader.<p>
