It's a gamble. if they lose even 60% of thier fan base, they are still sell a few hundred thousand albums.<p>

They know the value to tape trading. Metallica was a band that allowed people to tape at shows and had an active tape trading network. It was just that rather than taking a week or two for an unauthorized song to make it accross the country, and be available to a few thousand fans, it was available instantly, to a few million people.<p>

I think they were trying to kill it before it got really really large. They only canned 300,000+ users. That's less than 3% of thier highest album sales, and probably less than 10% of thier latest album sales. 
And the thing about napster is that it is not a trading network. The songs being traded are not fan recorded songs from shows. they are ripped copies of songs from CD's.  <p>

 Users are not going to thier friends house and copying tapes. They are not even getting songs from people they met at a concert. They probably have never even been to a concert. It's a big jukebox, but you don't have to pay anything.<p>

The music industry pushed way too hard for it's secure music initative. They are always too focused on preventing copying. They should have pushed a rights initiive, pay to listen.
