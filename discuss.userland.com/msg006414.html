<i>&gt;I guess it depends on your definition of CD quality. </i><br>
<i>&gt;MiniDiscs use lossy compression; it's just a different algorithm. </i><p>

The latest version of the MD compression scheme( I think it's version 5) is very very close to CD quality.  Note that while MD does employ lossy compression--it only removes frequencies that are beyond human hearing range.<p>

Point being--you're not going to be able to tell the difference between CD and MD.<p>

Why MD's never caught on in the US is beyond me--they're way way cool, are extremely portable, and don't skip like CD's do.</br>
