I remember the longish <i><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3708">Linux and winning</a></i> thread a couple of weeks ago here!<p>

If you're able to get Frontier serving from Linux I'd be the first to promote Frontier here.<p>

I can see the Frontier-WINE-FAQ going like this:<p>

1. How do I run WINE?
2. Frontier on WINE as fast as on NT?
3. Is Frontier on WINE secure?
4. Can I limit access of a Frontier process?
5. Are there disabled features, when running on WINE?
6. Is there a way to run Frontier as daemon (in the background without an X server)
...<p>
