If one were looking for documents by author (specifically, Dublin Core's usage of author, <dc:author>), one could quickly come to the idea that you could just search the net for any document that simply contained a matching <dc:author> element.  But would that get you what you were looking for?  No, because not only would you get documents that were by that author, you would also get documents that <i>refer</i> to that author (which was more than you asked for).<p><p>

RSS, for example, is all about XML documents that refer to documents by other people.  One could fine tune searches so that you could say "match <dc:author>, but not within RSS files" or "within RSS files, use the <link> that <dc:author> is attached to refer to the document by that author."  All this is possible because RSS makes it clear that RSS files are about other documents, and <dc:author> don't mean that that author wrote the RSS file.<p><p>

RDF, on the other hand, makes this automatic because the RSS <item> element has an 'rdf:about' attribute.  An RDF tool will <i>know</i> that <dc:author> isn't the author of the RSS file, but rather the author of the piece the RSS <item> describes.<p><p>

(As I mentioned earlier, a user doesn't need to know why or how this magic works, just that it does work if they use the provided element and attribute names.)
