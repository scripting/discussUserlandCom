Been recording my favorite CD's into mp3s.<p>

Everyone works better & faster with their favorite music, I believe that now.  Took Monkey Hip Gumbo to work last week. (not that I haven't played music at work, but I have a new perspective now)<p>

So I finally found a use for that cheap 30GB hard drive.<p>

Ry Cooder.  Yay!<p>

Bob Scobey's Frisco Band<p>

Bob Crosby<p>

		Woo Hoo!<p>


Go Userland!
