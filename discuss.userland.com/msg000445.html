What happens to Kiva?  Sun just bought NetDynamics and the two aren't very complimentary.  Quite a few companies and development shops are invested in that technology.<p>

What happens to mozilla.org?  If they're giving the servers to sun and leave mozilla as is, then that makes Netcenter a pretty expensive web site ($4 billion?).  And I thought AOL wasn't well liked now...<p>

I hope some analyst remembers to cover these in the conference call.
