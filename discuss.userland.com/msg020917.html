Ya know, its all that monetization and capitalization that allows the Olympics to function. More events, more participants, it all adds up.</i><p>

With respect, that's rubbish. It means that a few professional tennis players compete, and that the basketball competition becomes an exhibition tournament for the NBA, while the minority sports (and even the less famous competitors in the big sports) continue to receive a pittance of the media/sponsorship income.<p>

As an organisation, the Olympic movement doesn't reward effort equally: it skews it towards corporate interests and, most of all, towards self-gratification. (The scandal surrounding the Salt Lake City games is just the tip of the iceberg.)<p>

In many respects, the IOC is the sporting equivalent of the MPAA: a lumbering dinosaur of middle-management which hasn't noticed that the climate has changed.
