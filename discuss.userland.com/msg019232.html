All participants in such digital exchange acknowledge and respect the copyrights of the performers, writers and publishers of the music. This notice should be clearly posted on all sites engaged in this activity. We reserve the ability to withdraw our sanction of noncommercial digital music should circumstances arise that compromise our ability to protect and steward the integrity of our work."<br><br>	Finally, a newspaper correctly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/07/biztech/articles/29napster.html">explains</a> that Napster is an "Internet search engine that enables users to find and trade songs between computers." There's been so much incorrect reporting in the last few days. They should make the reporters take a freshman Computer Science class. They. Who are they? I don't know. Good night.<br><br>	One more thing. AOL subsidiary <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">WinAmp</a> operates a search engine that does the same thing. AOL is merging with Time-Warner, which is part of the RIAA. So if they shut down Napster, we don't have to go to Gnutella to get the music, we can go to Time-Warner. How can they sue Napster for what they do themselves? Someone is ethically impaired here. This seems newsworthy. (I just checked, the search engine is still there, and I searched for Metallica, and got lots of MP3s, which I didn't download, but I <i>could</i> have.) <br><br>	MacCentral: <a href="http://www.maccentral.com/news/0007/28.cube.shtml">Apple could be sued over Cube design</a>.

That growth resulted from two things: Napster's user experience and its focus on music. The court decision strikes at the heart of the first of these reasons. It leaves the second intact, which is why, thanks to its massive user base, Napster has a bright future after all."<br><br>	If you doubted the commercialization of music, read this <a href="http://guster.scribble.nu/">account</a> by a musician named Thundergod, of the Rockfest in Chicago, July 22. <br><br>	<a href="http://q.queso.com/discuss/msgReader$664">Jason Levine</a> gives Joel some passport trouble.<br><br>	Public Citizen did a <a href="http://www.citizen.org/hrg/PUBLICATIONS/1501.htm">study</a> of threats to radio stations.
