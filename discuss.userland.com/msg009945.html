HA! You're cracking me up Dave!<p>

But, as for ESR...sure, he's taken the opportunities given, but so have you, Dave. So have you. Not a contributer?? Do you know how long he's been around? Here's the list of <A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/projects.html">projects</A> he's involved in, and specifically <A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/software.html">here, his open source software collection</A>. I use fetchmail every day. He's maintained the Jargon File since 1990, and been involved with the GNU project since the early 1980s. I strongly disagree with you here; but hey, you've got a right to your opinion!
