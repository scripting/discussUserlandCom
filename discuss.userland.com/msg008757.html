I've looked into this before. I don't have all the URLs immediately available, but here's what I remember:<p>

<ul>
<li>Day-old data is available for $20/month from a number of sources. These sources seem to be small, obscure companies for the most part.</li>
<li>15-minute-old data is available, but costs real $$$. The pricing model is usually calculated on a per-end-user basis, and you generally need to know how many people could see the data.</li>
<li>Up-to-the-minute data is available, but it's very, very expensive.</li>
</ul><p>

The market data is owned by the various exchanges. They have lots of rules about how it can be used.<p>

Cheers,<br>
