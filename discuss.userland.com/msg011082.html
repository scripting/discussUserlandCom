Just because it's on your computer doesn't mean you own it.<p>

As far as I'm concerned, yes, they are too getting the same thing.  They get my HTML page.  Precisely what they do with it is up to them, within the standard conventions.  They still don't own it; they can't sell it for profit, etc. etc. yadda yadda yadda.  But they are getting exactly what I sent them.<p>

The issue (to me) is NOT what is seen on the screen, but the content that is connected to my web site.
