I would like to try XML-RPC to allow RPCs between some Python and Perl code.  I see that there are client-side libraries for both Perl and Python, but no servers.  Is anyone aware of anybody working on such beasts that will be made available publically?<p>

On the surface at least, it doesn't appear that subclassing the Python BasicHTTPServer class to add the desired functionality would be that difficult.  Still, I'd rather build on others' work instead of starting from scratch if possible.<p>

Thx,<p>
