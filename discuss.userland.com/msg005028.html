The format of a single line is this:<p>

reference title<p>

There should be a space between the reference and the title. The title can have multiple spaces. The title does not have to match the actual title of the page.<p>

The reference should be a Frontier address or an http or ftp URL. (The reference also should not contain spaces -- so if it's in a guest database, use a relative address, such as mySite.myPage, rather than a full address.)<p>

Does this help? If not, providing an example of your problem will help us help you.
