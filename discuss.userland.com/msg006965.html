A little suggestion from a long-time reader.<p>

Could you please use a different font or colour to distinguish 
between your own commentary and what you are quoting on the 
Scripting News page. Sometimes you forget to use quotation marks 
and we can't tell whether you are speaking or quoting someone else.<p>

The entry from ComputerWorld is a good example. My first impression 
is that this is your opinion:  "Mac OS X Server is a poorly designed,
poorly integrated set of three operating systems"  But perhaps that
is a quote.<p>

Thanks
