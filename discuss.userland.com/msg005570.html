You may want to multiply by -1 to change the sign. You can play other games, too. "number (infinity - date (clock.now())) * -1" produces a number which sorts in <i>reverse</i> chron order.<p>

I've stopped playing those games and taken the hint from the news/dg stuff and started storing things in year/month/day tables. For reverse listings, I just use a "for ctItems downTo 1". Seems to have taken care of most stuff I sort by date.
