If you give it a unique value, ie, not one of the ones we use in RU, any other attributes are safe. It's kind of like the four-character app id's on the Macintosh. We probably should have some kind of registry for type values, to avoid conflicts. At the beginning Apple reserved all lowercase names for themselves, but we can do better.
