I consider VNC a far better solutions for machines on LANs.  (I've tried the very limitted free X server you mentioned)<p>

The only client for NT I've found worked really well (with most everything) was Hummingbird and at $300, it's overpriced.  C'mon-- you can buy another computer for that!!<p>

VNC Has other strengths as well-- your NT/Windows box crashes, and there is your wonder VNC session still running on that stable linux box right up to the keystroke when your NT box crapped out.<p>

Quite honestly, VNC felt snapier than hummingbird running on a 100mbit lan with 450mhz systems for client & server.<p>

Last VNC point to comment on:  Turn on applet serving, and your linux box is ready and waiting with a GUI from any computer with a java enabled web browser!  You haven't lived till you're using your NT box running Explorer 5.0 to connect to your linux box using VNC/Java, then opening up Netscape 4.0 and running it on Linux!
