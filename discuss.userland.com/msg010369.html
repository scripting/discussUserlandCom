Not until the exponential growth rate of the Internet drops below the exponential increase in the number of indexed pages.<p>

More interestingly, which is (exponentially) growing faster: The number of indexed pages, or the number of <I>quality</I> pages that I might be interested in having packaged and sold to me? (After all, I don't need to buy the whole Internet.) (Quality here as loosely as possibly; for instance, 95% of geocities is not quality... most of microsoft.com is.)
