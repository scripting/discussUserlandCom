Once the UI is worked out, we can integrate the functionality in Manila. The key is to not bind the spell-checker into any single vendor's software, to clearly define an interface that allows any CMS to hook in.<p>BTW, David Adams of Stuffed Dog is working on one too. I asked him if we could help, or if he would make his word list public. If there's going to be more than one of these, great, but let's be sure we have compatible xml-rpc interfaces.<p><p>
