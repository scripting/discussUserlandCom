Well, there's also<p>

1a. Microsoft wins less than completely on appeal. One count of anti-trust violations is overturned (Judge Jackson found MS guilty on two counts of violating anti-trust law), and the appeals court puts some sort of conduct remedy in place, forcing Microsoft to at least be more creative in how it grabs new markets. Alternatively, a settlement might be reached with the same effect, though I suspect that Joel Klein and Janet Reno (and possibly Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates) have to go before a settlement is really possible. Still, I think this is very likely.
