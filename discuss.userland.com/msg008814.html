One of the effects of this is a sudden burst of "How to do <i>foo</i> on the Web" articles.<p>

It would be nice to see a "How to run a dynamic website using Frontier" article in there. I'd offer to write it, but don't have enough knowledge about the features of Frontier 6. It might want to wait for Manila, but it's probably a good way to spread the message to folks who don't normally think of Frontier, especially the folks who are coming from the NetObjects/NeXT or Linux worlds.<p>

Just a thought....<p>
