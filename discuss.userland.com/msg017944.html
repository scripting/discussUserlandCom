First, figure out about how many song files are downloaded by the average user in a month. Then figure out the ASCAP fees (the money radio stations pay record companies as royalties for using the music) for that many song files. Now figure out how much to add to that to dollar value to be profitable. Then start charging us that fee to use Napster. <p>

It's simple, it gets Napster out of legal troubles, pays the artists back, and gives Napster the money to keep their login servers up.<p>

If Napster were reliable and everything I downloaded would give a small kickback to the artist, I'd glady pay up to $30 a month for the privilege of using napster. It'd throw the whole music distribution world on its ear, people would download and pay for music electronically, without ever having to set foot in a record store.<p>

Ask them why they're not doing this today.
