...from a true Deadhead.<p>

At some concerts, tip jars would just get peed in, even if the music was good.<p>

I'll bet you a dollar that most Napster fans want something for nothing. If they had to pay, they wouldn't use the system.<p>

A hell of a lot more goes in to recording a song than the artist's time. I've spent days in a booth working on one song. The band was around for only a few hours. In the "tip" system, how do you compensate the producer? The engineer? The writer? Most of today's songs owe a large part of their popularity to the production. Musicians aren't necessarily good producers.
