We did consider it, when the hype was hot and heavy. We couldn't even get a look at the license agreement. They were busy doing deals with big names, and fighting Microsoft, and the only way that ordinary developers could work with Java was to convert all our code to Java. Porting is one of the most senseless wastes of time, we would have had to really believed that there was no other way to the market. But the substance wasn't there. And having just gotten free of being a captive Apple developer, I certainly didn't want to sign up for being a Sun developer, whose rep was even worse than Apple for blowing off developers.<p>
