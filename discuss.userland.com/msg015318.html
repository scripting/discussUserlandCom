I went over to his site and signed up as a member only to find that I can't post to his Discussion Group.  Argh... :-)<p>

OK.  So I can suggest a partial solution to some of his comments.  John Lim said...<p>

<i>
I want to create separate sections on my home page on running themes. I want to incorporate multiple stories into one page, to introduce running commentaries on particular themes.<p>

I want to give a portion of my home page to a guest editor to write. I want the ability to introduce moderators who will edit guest contributions.<p>

And I want this to be as easy as the rest of Manila.

I don't know about the easy part but you can look at <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$88">http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$88</a>.  I'm beginning to use it and so far it's pretty kewl!
