We're going to get the story here one way or the other. Bill Joy's latest creation. Will the developers flock to write code at Uncle Bill's altar? Will he breathe new life into P2P?

"Multiple columns per row — a first for any outliner that we've seen!" Wow. Takes your breath away. <a href="http://www.outliners.com/more31.html">MORE</a> didn't do multiple columns, but <a href="http://www.macworld.com/1995/01/reviews/11.html">InfoDepot</a> and <a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~caveman/Creative/Software/macworld0594.htm#prod8">In Control</a> did. Imho, if you design it that way, it's more of a spreadsheet than a thinking or writing tool. Users beware, one of the lessons of the last round in outlining is that you don't want your ideas locked up in a proprietary format. That's why MORE had lots of import/export capabilities. Before you commit to Omni, ask them to clearly state that your work won't be locked up. "OPML" is the perfect solution for interchange between programs that understand textual hierarchies. Keep the market open. It's good to have competition. One more thing, be sure they have a good scripting interface. It's important.<br><br>I got an email last night from Philip Greenspun with a <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/internet-application-workbook/distributed-computing">pointer</a> to a chapter of a new book he's working on about SOAP and XML-RPC. I guess they're going to be teaching this stuff at MIT. He asked for some more pointers, and I sent him links to <a href="http://www.soapware.org/">soapware.org</a>, the "BDG", "xmlStorageSystem", and Manila's scripting <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/manilarpc">interface</a>, with a suggestion that we do some work on getting the Ars Digita community system and Manila interoperating. Of course this assumes that his VCs and/or the Delaware court let him work on behalf of their users. <br><br>Red Herring: <a href="http://www.herring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=40000004&doc_id=1520019152&rh_special_report_id=">What's it like to be a VC now?</a><br><br><a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/opinion/dgillmor/dg042501.htm">Dan Gillmor</a>: "On Friday, a federal judge blocked the publishing of a novel called The Wind Done Gone -- a retelling of the 1936 saga Gone With the Wind from the perspective of a slave, a half-sister of Scarlett O'Hara.
