Conceptually there's no obvious flaw in it. I haven't requested the code and accepted the NDA, and I will not. As soon as there is NDA-less code available, I'll take a look.<p>

If they do the code even nominally right, wouldn't this just be a DLL? Or does Radio UserLand not support extension via DLLs?
