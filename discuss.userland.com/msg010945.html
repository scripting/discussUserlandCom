Please take a look at

to see why I am rather glad to have a dual-CPU machine :)<p>

What happens is the following:<p>

Running is an NT WS 40 with Real Player (hey, it's Sunday), a Macintosh Emulator called "BasiliskII" with an Ethertalk connection to our server, a VMware virtual machine just starting up a Win98 installation [all network stuff _is_ working!] allowing me to test software install programs without reinstalling a whole machine everytime it is wrecked again (just copy a backup file of the installation and voila!, brand new installation. I love it and will buy it...) and some other stuff...<p>

just to let you know this can be done, and sometimes even serves a serious purpose... :)<p>

regards,<p>
