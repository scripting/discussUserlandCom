I had something similar happen when I was designing the interface to an Access database.  People all said they wanted better colors, so I had them all vote on them.  3 weeks after I put the change to the spiffy new colors, I started getting mails from people asking for the plain old gray and blue back.  <p>

Something that looks nice when you design it, rarely looks as nice when you use it day in and day out for months.  <p>

My own personal policy on graphics and color schemes is...<p>

Design with only B&W, grays, and earth tones.  
When you release the product, ignore the first 3 weeks of "could you please change the colors" emails.
If after 3 weeks, people actually are still yelling about color, only THEN should you consider changing it.  :-)
