Let me specify the most likely next page someone will choose, and preload it into cache while they're reading the current page.  If you find an HREF labeled "Next" pre-load it automatically.  This is a totally benign enhancement that could make a real difference to the user.<p>

Number 2 is the ability to assign command keys to links on the page.<p>

And number 3 is a more robust user interface, like menus, but it has to become a real standard and be very obvious so you don't have to be computer literate to understand it.
