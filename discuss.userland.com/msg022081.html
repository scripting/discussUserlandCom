I'm going to answer the Big Question -- What the heck is the business model for this weblog stuff? There's good news and bad news. The good news is that most of the money will be made by the users. That's also the bad news.<br><br>Hey I got an email from <a href="http://petedako.manilasites.com/">Pete Dako</a> who was Rookie of the Year in the Frontier community in 1992. Nice to hear from an oldtimer. He did the production for the Frontier 3.0 docs, for love, very little money. That was back when we printed docs on dead trees. Them was the days. Come sit on my knee, I'll tell you all about it.

So I linked to it from Scripting News, and gave them a compliment. I said it was the best RSS support for any major newspaper. Instead of thanking me, or quoting me, they took it offline. Somedays it feels like it's just not worth gettin out of bed.<br><br>Here's a public comment. I don't think most of the newspapers know why they're on the Web. Talking with the NY Times licensing manager last week she pointed out that they don't charge us to link to their stories. I nodded my head. "Oh that's nice," I said, thinking to myself, "They don't know why they're on the Web." <br><br><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/decentralization/message/1343">Josh Allen</a>: "Well, chips are just software that has been compiled into silicon, and strangely, when you compile your code into silicon, you don't have the same crowd yelling at you to GPL it."<br><br>AP: <a href="http://inq.philly.com/content/inquirer/2001/02/12/national/12LAND.htm">Spacecraft lands on asteroid</a>.<br><br><a href="mailto:csurfer@interport.net?Subject=Re:%20NY%20Office%20Space">Jason McCabe Calacanis</a>: "If anyone is interested in renting desk space at our newly renovated office please let me know.
