My first demo of Debian is always doing a "apt-get update; apt-get upgrade" and explaining what happens behind the scenes, because I've found it very successful in gaining many a convert.<p>

Debian's auto-updating process has always worked seamlessly for me, and I am constantly impressed (being very much an outsider to the Debian Project) by the large number of people who work to make sure it does. It really is a sensible model to only declare an OS upgrade complete if ALL the software available for the OS (officially, at least) functions properly. But very open-source dependent, of course.<p>

I think an Internet protocol for software updates, plus freely available implementations, embeddable into software for every platform, would be great. How about implementing it over XML-RPC? It'd probably be too inefficient to send the actual patches via XML-RPC, but a free system that would make it trivial to:<p>

<UL><LI>automatically 'diff' files and directories, with the possibility of adding support for arbitrary data structures like Frontier's object databases
<LI>post the diffs on a Web or FTP site for download
<LI>publish the above information
<LI>run a small daemon or CGI to answer XML-RPC requests that include the current version of the software the user is running, possibly some authentication information like a serial number, and to return the location of the patcher to get the user to the newest version
<LI>download the patch, or pass the location to something like 'wget' on UNIX or URL Access on the Mac
<LI>apply the patch, and have reasonable defaults if patching fails (like offering to get the full version of the program from the same site, or suggesting a reinstall first if it's commercial software)
<LI>provide embeddable support for applications to do all this themselves, or a separate component/application that they can call on
<LI>provide a system-wide UI for users to schedule update checking and retrieval
</UL><p>

It'd be great to have such a facility as a system service, to avoid baking FTP/HTTP download code and checking facilities into every application. I could also imagine it'd cut down on network traffic - I know lots of people who post full versions upgrades of software upgrades because it's too difficult, too expensive, or too hard to support to create a patcher. On the Mac at least, it's worked for Internet Config as a third-party model that worked so well that it was eventually made a part of the system, why not this?<p>

Something like Apple's online update model for QuickTime 4 and Mac OS 9 (using MindVision's technology) would be great. I'm sure Windows Update works similarly.<p>
