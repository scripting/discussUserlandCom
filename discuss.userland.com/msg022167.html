So it appears to be lockdown time in SOAP 1.1 interop. With Microsoft and Apache deploying the results of the interop work, it's time for UserLand to do the same and ask developers to start building apps.  <br><br><a href="http://w3future.com/html/xmlrpc.html">Sjoerd Visscher</a> has a really nice XML-RPC-based spell-checker app. "For me it was the perfect application to test my new XML-RPC client for IE5 and Mozilla. The XML-RPC client sends the input text to the spell-check service, which returns the misspelled words and the alternatives. Then an interface is dynamically created from that data."<br><br><a href="http://www2.linuxjournal.com/articles/briefs/0082.html">Linux Journal</a>: "User interface pioneer Douglas Engelbart, who demonstrated a mouse-driven hypertext system called NLS in 1968, said in an interview Wednesday that he will help Prodigy defend itself against a patent infringement lawsuit filed by British Telecom. BT is suing Prodigy for infringement of BT's patent on hyperlinks." <i>Bravo!</i><br><br>Hey I just got news that I'm doing a big session at Seybold SF, a spectacle, on the topic of my choosing. I've always had a fantastic time at Seybold. The best session I ever did was the Can Apple Survive panel in 1997 (the answer turned out to be yes). Glad to be working for Craig, Thad and Liz. We're going to have such a great time! I think it will be on Web Services and Publishing. Yeah, that's it. With a focus on Mac OS X. By then I will not be dropping hints anymore.

That's not really a good idea, since everyone uses Word, and if you don't have a copy on your system you won't be able to read the documents they send you."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/paperClipGoodbyeFuckOff.gif" height="78" width="52" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></a>When I open a file in Microsoft Word it takes a couple of minutes to fail to open the file. Then I open it again, and it fails, but Word launches and the paper clip reminds me that I can enter a date by pressing some weird key combo. Then I open it a third time and the file opens. But my machine gets really slow. I read the document, close the file, quit Word, but now every other program is very slow at echoing my characters. The only way to cure the problem is to restart the system.<br><br>Sometimes anger is <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/sometimesangerisbeautiful.gif">beautiful</a>.<br><br>I love the title of this <a href="http://www.wirednews.com/news/technology/0,1282,43447,00.html">story</a>.

Have a kind word for the programmer. They're really nice down-home people. And don't forget to mention "SOAP" and "XML-RPC".
