ftp is a two-way communication mechanism is the sense that a client can do both "get" and "put".<p>

BBEdit, for example has a pretty good "Open From FTP Server" feature (cmd-shift-O instead of cmd-O).  You get a dialog box that looks pretty much like a normal Mac StandardGetFile() box, but with ftp server information down one side.  You can browse around an ftp server in the same way as you can browse a local hard disk (without even a speed penalty if the ftp server is on your local ethernet).  When you select a file to view, BBEdit ftp "get"s it, you edit it, and any time you hit "save" it ftp "put"s it back.<p>

I use this all the time for quick updates to web sites -- sometimes on the other side of the world from me (e.g. Auckland from Seattle).<p>

If Dreamweaver has a full ftp "get" and "put" capability in much the same way as BBEdit then it wouldn't take much work to integrate this into Frontier.  You could map Frontier tables to ftp directories and let the user browse around your Frontier database.  Or, you could set up a virtual file system in Frontier in some other way.
