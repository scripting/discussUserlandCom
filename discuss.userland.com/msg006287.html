As soon as I wrote my message I realized that the action might be happening in the xml verbs.  I haven't gotten into xml much yet.  Looks like it's time to start diggin' so I have a deeper understanding of what's happening where! :-)<p>

Right.  Don't go fiddling with the xml now.  Maybe just put the idea in the hopper for next time there is some work being done on the xml verbs.<p>

Hmmm... I suppose I could script some kind of preprocessor...  Any chance for callbacks?  I guess in my case, I could use one just before the outline is processed by xml.compile.<p>
