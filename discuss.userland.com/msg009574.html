Aside from that, is there a way yet to search the new DG?<p>

I was trying to find if there were any messages about Eric Kidd's emacs to XML-RPC interface in the new DG, since there is nothing newer on this DG than the earlier discussions about how to do it and you mentioned in a recent message that he now has one. Has Eric posted any information about the emacs to XML-RPC interface?
