If that is the case, a simple filter in Frontier's webserver could solve the problem.<p>

Or am I not remember things correctly (was it PC only?). <p>

I'm just about finished with my current project, I'll gladly help you to get xml-rpc going in Dreamweaver. You know DW really well, and I'm fairly knowledgable with Frontier.
