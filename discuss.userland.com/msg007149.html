"You have to have Office because you'll get Word documents or Excel spreadsheets or PowerPoint presentations as email enclosures, and how will you read them if you don't have the apps that created them?"<p>

Microsoft supply small plugins for IE that allow you read these files within the browser without having the full apps.<p>

If you don't have the application installed, IE will go and fetch the plug-in for you and then display the file.
