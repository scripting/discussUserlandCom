It would be moral if it had a chance of acheiving a desirable goal.<p>

It does not.<p>

Feeling bad about something that is happening and feeling that you have to do SOMETHING is not moral, even though it feels as if it is.<p>

Doing something that would actually help the situation would be moral.  Not a general in the US military thought that this would help, they told Clinton that, and they were told to do it anyway.<p>

That is not moral.
