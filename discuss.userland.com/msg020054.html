However, if they work on GPLed code, they cannot have a sustainable business because anyone can sell copies of it for less or even give it away for free.</i><p>

A footnote for the audience:<p>

<a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/">Ars Digita</a> is a consulting company. They have an open source toolkit, which they use to implement custom software for businesses.<p>

Rumor says they're making money hand over fist.<p>

But this doesn't necessarily affect Brett's argument, either. Ars Digita doesn't make their money off of software in boxes, and they don't make it off of $5,000 support contracts (the way Cygnus did). Ars Digita makes their money off of custom-built, in-house software projects for major coporate customers.<p>

For somebody like me, this is a great business model. I get to work directly with my clients, and every project is different. (I'm a people person with a short attention span.)<p>

Of course, if you work with the wrong clients, this business model can quickly become a major pain in the neck.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
