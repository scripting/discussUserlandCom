Gotta disagree with this one.<p>

The best programmers I've ever known have something in common: they're all lazy at heart. Why do stupid little things over & over, when you can take the effort once to invent a way to have something else do that work for you? One big effort, and then (in theory!) no more work.<p>

Life is easier when you invent stuff. Your next best bet is to hope that some lazy inventor out there has the exact needs as yours, and then ride on their inventions.
