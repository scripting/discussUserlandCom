(OK, that really very seldom happens...*grin*...but my boss probably likes to see me write that!). Anyway, I wasn't so sure about the past couple of days, I've been wondering...but then, a GREAT quote in your <A HREF="http://www.lists.ic.ac.uk/hypermail/xml-dev/xml-dev-Oct-1999/0107.html">message</A> to the XML-DEV list, Dave! <p>

"Moral of the story --> let's build more apps, fewer specs."<p>

AbSOlutely. Not that I've been great at it lately...but hey...*grin*. I just took myself off of an OSS projects dev-list because of INCESSANT, CONSTANT mucking about with design specs. Not even really bickering, not too much flaming or anything; but nothing to work with! No code! No app! Write it, if it doesn't work, change it. But get SOMETHING...<p>

Sorry to rant a bit; you just struck a chord, Dave. Hope you're having a good day...
