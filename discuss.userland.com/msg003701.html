Dave, have you considered contracting a Unix port out to somebody who <i>is</i> willing to do such a port?<p>

I can understand your reluctance to move to an unfamilar environment.  I know that when I was an "MFC programmer" a few years back, I resisted OWL at any cost.  Likewise now, I am so comfortable with Qt that going with an unfamilar wxWindows/Jx/Gtk+/FLTK or even the old MFC would feel unnatural.  It is easy to settle into a predictable mode and just cruuuuise.<p>

Still, others don't share your comfort zone.  In particular, there are quite a few people that are <i>very</i> comfortable dealing with a Unix environment.<p>

I am thinking, by way of example, of Troll Tech AS (the makers of
the Qt toolkit).  They have shown time and again their effeciency and proficiency at quickly porting code from a variety of platforms to
Unix.  The most recent example is their porting of the (Windows) Opera browser in only three weeks (<a href="http://www.operasoftware.com/news.html">http://www.operasoftware.com/news.html</a>).<p>

Joining forces with a hungry group like this could be a win-win situtation for both parties.  You would satisfy those customers that want a Unix version of Frontier (as well as open up an entirely new base of potential customers) and the porting group would get good publicity (and, one would assume, some fee).<p>

The power of Frontier with the stability of Unix.  Mmmmm...
