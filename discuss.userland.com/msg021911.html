<blockquote><b>EXIT-POLL RESULTS (4 P.M. REPORT)</b><br>
According to sources who have seen the 4 p.m. Voter News Service exit-poll updates, here are the latest results (offered, once again, with the proviso that this information remains wildly sketchy): George W. Bush still up slightly in the popular vote, 48 percent to 47 percent. Al Gore is ahead in Florida (50-47 percent), Michigan (51-48 percent), Maine (48-46 percent), Oregon (slightly), Washington (very, very slightly) and Tennessee (ditto). Bush is ahead slightly in Iowa and Missouri. No updates on other states. In the Senate, things continue to look good for Clinton in New York, Corzine in New Jersey, and Carper in Delaware.</blockquote>
