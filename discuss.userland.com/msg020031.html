I have to disagree. The code achieves the greatest possible benefit under the GPL. The goal of the GPL is not to hurt people -- just the oppposite, it is to help. If I release my software to the world, I want people to always be able to use it. I want people to add to it and improve it, and I want people to be able to use those additions and improvements too.<p>

I don't do it because I like being mean, or I like to destroy proprietary software companies. No, I do it because I want to help people with my software and this is the best way to do it.<p>

I just want to help people, why do you think this is so evil?
