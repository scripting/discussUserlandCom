Sure. The browser has little or nothing to do with SOAP or XML-RPC.<p>

The best place to ask for support for these technologies is in the Mac OS, hidden behind the interfaces of the Apple Event Manager.<p>

BTW, Frontier supports XML-RPC and runs on Mac OS. Mark Aldritt has been working on XML-RPC support for AppleScript. Steve Zellers pops up from time to time with helpful clues. Next week is WWDC, ask gently whether Apple wants to play in the scriptable web.
