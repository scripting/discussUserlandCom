This means Dave is taking a big chance just by linking to their disclaimer page.
They have also tried to make this into a shrink-wrap 'contract', not just a statement of copyrights: claiming you consent to these terms by accessing their web site.<p>

These issues are symptomatic of a more general problem with intellectual property: Legally, there is no down side to claiming the world, even if you know your claim has no base at all. It seems to me that if I claim rights that I know to be bogus (or I should have known to be bogus), I should somehow liable for some kind of fraud.<p>

What would happen if I start telling people they need to pay me a toll to enter city hall? OK, what if I just charge people entering city hall "for commercial purposes"? They'd think about what to charge me with while I sat in jail for a while, that's what. This is no different than a software (or web page) license telling me I can't reverse-engineer their code, or resell the product (BTW - Nintendo claims you're not allowed to rent their games either).<p>

This is why shrink-wrap licenses and such are always so restrictive. Why not? The worst thing that could happen is some court might rule a clause to be invalid.<p>

I think there should be _SOME_ kind of legal exposure to this kind of contract-puffing.
