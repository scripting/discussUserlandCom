The Gnumeric developers plan to do exactly this, by the way.<p>

Gnumeric is based on CORBA and <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/arch/component/bonobo.html">Bonobo</a>. These are roughly equivalent to COM and OLE. In fact, there's even a GNOME::Unknown interface, so COM developers will feel right at home. :-)<p>

Here's the <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/gnumeric/idl/Gnumeric.idl">scripting interface</a> to Gnumeric. This stuff is still pretty beta.<p>

I wonder if it's possible to build an XML-RPC->CORBA gateway? Python is probably the best bet; it has good support for both protocols.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
