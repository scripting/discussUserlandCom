It's at <a href="http://petition.eurolinux.org/index_html">http://petition.eurolinux.org/index_html</a><p>

From their home page, "This petition is directed to the European Parliament. Its goal is to warn European Authorities against the dangers of software patents. This petition is supported by the EuroLinux Alliance together with European companies and open source associations. Please make this petition well known to everybody concerned."<p>

They're accepting signatures from all parts of the world. I imagine those from EU based developers are especially welcome.
