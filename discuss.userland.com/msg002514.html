Of course, to use IP
you have to have an IP address. As far as I can tell, Jini claims
that devices can recognize each other as soon as they are plugged
in, but I don't see how IP addresses are assigned.</i><p>

I believe that Jini is independent of underlying protocols.  That is, it can use TCP/IP, but it can also use other protocols (the standard demo uses some non-IP radio or IR protocols), and does, I think, use UDP broadcast or multicast for service discovery and announcement.
