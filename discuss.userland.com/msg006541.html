There is a communications problem, not sure exactly what it is. The HTTP request to slashdot.org is timing out, it's setting the error bit on the service, and my.userland.com is panicking. <p>

(It's probably the wrong policy to hide a channel that's erroring out. It's probably better to just display the old content and somehow tell the reader that it hasn't been updated in a while.)<p>

Bottom-line, the SlashDot ultramode.txt file isn't coming back.
