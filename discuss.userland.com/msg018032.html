I gotcha there.<p>

In the design I'm working on, any node in the outline can be a reference to another outline.<p>

When you expand it, the contents of the remote outline fills in.<p>

BTW, this is the Webification of something we shipped in ThinkTank 2.0 on the PC in 1985 called cloning. It was also implemented in <a href="http://www.outliners.com/more30.html">MORE 3</a>, so if you have a Mac around, download it and try it out. It's a pretty magical feature.<p>

<b>Important point</b><p>

While outliners <i>present</i> everything as a hiearchy, outliners are not limited to displaying hierarchies.<p>

This btw, was why I shit-canned Clay Basket in 1995. We needed to loop into the Web, not try to make each website an outline. It was a five-year loop, but totally worth it.
