Get up to speed on the web standards issues. The Mac people I hear from ignore these. I don't care a whit about a limited rendering capability provided by Apple. At this point, all that matters is having the MSIE renderer accessible in the OS as it is in Windows.<p>

Mac users, your issue is with Apple, not UserLand. They make an OS that is not competitive with Windows in this very key area.<p>

And Oliver and others, please listen very carefully. Manila is not going to be Windows-only. But there will be features that people will love that *will* be Windows-only, if and only if, Apple fails to act. There is still time. But we won't wait for Apple. I want that to be very very clear.
