My gut agrees with your gut!<p>

And I think a lot of the popular music is more a product of the industry than art. When I was a kid and learned that The Monkees were just a TV show cast in the normal way. I remembered being pissed off to learn this, and I was just a kid then.<p>

Anyway, the recording industry would do well to jump out of the plane and leave the parachute behind. When copy protection came off in the software business Microsoft had sales of under a billion dollars. After the protection came off their sales grew to many many billions. Not saying the two are related, but trusting the customers is not such a bad business to be in as certain linear thinking might lead you to believe.
