Where it's come to court, the cases have been dismissed for insufficient evidence. Even this poster, <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1221">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1221</a>, while suggesting a smoking gun may be found in trial, doesn't suggest any high crimes. <p>

So permit me to ask...<p>

Q. Do you believe sexual harrassment is closer to a high crime, like treason, or a mundane crime, like murder? <p>

Q. Is Clinton unable to perform the duties of the office? 
Q. Is he threatening the constitutional checks and balances of our federal system? 
Q. Is he endangering the country as a fanatic or insane person? 
Has he committed a mundane (vs. high) crime so heinous that the public can't stomach him in office until the next election? <p>

So: 
- I don't think we should oust him on the basis of what came before the committee
- despite the Judiciary Committee's report, I don't think the House should rubber stamp it and impeach the President. 
- I think the President is right to defend himself in the court of public opinion, especially seeing the kangaroo court character of the Judiciary Committee's proceedings.  
I say "Amen!" to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1223">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1223</a>.
