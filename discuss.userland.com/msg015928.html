I agree. One of the problems: the other methods for moving files around (http, ftp) are a little complicated and require people, many newbies, to learn something new. <p>

Perhaps there is room for an email plugin that <ul><li>scans for outbound large attachments, <li>detaches them and files them to an ftp or http store for retrieval, <li>continues the email with instructions for retrieval ("click here to download"). </ul>Anyone listenting from iPlanet, AOL, Software.com, Sendmail? <p>
