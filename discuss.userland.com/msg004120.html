It currently supports Windows, and it used to support the BeOS to a certain extent. Perhaps they're up to something recently?<p>

As for Windows developers: there's an open-source library called WINE which supports about 90% of the Windows APIs. It's more or less useless as an emulator (although it does run Lotus Notes fairly well), but it can also be used as a porting library.<p>

Corel used WINE to port WordPerfect 8 to Linux, and they're pouring a fair bit of money into enhancing it so that they can port CorelDraw and their other packages. On another front, Corel has contracted with Cygnus to add MSVC++ extensions to GCC.<p>

As far as I can tell, the barriers between Linux and the desktop operating systems are falling, at least for adventurous developers.
