I believe that copyright applies to the LP - the collection, not the song.<p>

In a copyright-by-song model, can I deduct $.99 from the price of <u>Patsy Cline Sings Song of Love</u> because I already have the recording of 'Crazy' from Rolling Stone's <u>Women in Rock</u>? I don't think so. By redistributing the work <i>in part</i> you may be violating copyright. Is there any way to know that you are acquiring the very same version of the song that you own? There must be 50 recordings of Patsy's song out there...<p>

Ugh. A bazillion details!
