Found out tonight what this might be.<p>

The OpenStep/YellowBox FoundationKit appears to implement much of its functionality with private C functions, probably for speed (no ObjC method dispatch overhead).<p>

It might also make thread safety easier to implement and faster, since making ObjC method calls thread safe has required some heavy mutex overhead. (Luckily, the overhead only comes into play if you call a certain objc_setMultithreaded() runtime function).<p>

Apple could have exposed this private API, and fleshed it out a bit.<p>

So, it's probably not a reimplementation, or a wrapper around the class framework, but a new use for code that's been around for a while.
