Hello all,<p>

First, let me thank all the people at Userland for making the changes to the SE (searchEngine) to open it up to indexing numbers and small words.  I really needed that feature in my context.  I had made my own modifications to the SE scripts to support number indexing.  Now I don't have to worry about maintaining those custom scripts!  Yahoo!<p>

I've been working with the latest 8/20/1998 SE changes and I was having a problem.<p>

I'm using mainResponder.search.utilities.indexDiscussionGroup to index my DG (discussion group) over again.  I ran the script and shortly got the error: &quot;Can't create item &quot;index.&quot; because &quot;&quot; is an illegal name.&quot;.  I clicked on the &quot;Go To&quot; button in the Error Info window and was taken to mainResponder.search.server.indexOnePage, to the following if block:
<pre>
if not defined (adrLetter^) &#123;
	new (tableType, adrLetter)&#125;
                                 ^<i>cursor pointing just before here</i>
</pre>
So I reran the script in debug mode and checked some values and found these:
<pre>
adrLetter	address:	@["Frontier:Frontier™ v6.0 ƒ:Guest Databases:ops:Index.root"].index
firstLetter	string:	
oneWord	string:	
</pre>
adrLetter is pointing to the index table itself, not a letter table.    firstLetter and oneWord are both strings of size 0.  Somewhere along the line, those values became empty.<p>

So I dug a bit more and found that if the text being indexed contains some text like so...<p>

martians land on earth , have some coffee, and buzz off!<p>

...the script sets oneWord to &quot;,&quot; because it's surrounded by spaces.  The script does some cleaning after the oneWord is set and we end up with nothing, which causes the address problem I saw.<p>

Here is what I did to fix mainResponder.search.server.indexOnePage so it worked for me.  Don't do this unless you know what you are doing!  I put in a check for a word of zero length.  I put my check in below this commented out if block...
<pre>
if sizeOf (oneWord) < 3 <a href="http://we/">//we</a> don't index very short words, except for "op" and "wp"
</pre>
Here's the check I put in...
<pre>
if sizeOf (oneWord) == 0 {
	continue}
</pre>
