I'd like to know more about: 1)why you find this better and 2)what else you do with the outliner.<p>

I was particulary interested in your comments: "If I'm not sensitive and I disagree intensely with someone's (junior to me) point, they tend to shut down and not play. If I disagree strongly with a senior, they get distracted by the rank issue and try to shut me down and neither of us has any fun. " There are many techniques you can use as a technographer/facilitator to rebuild the consensus. I'd be glad to share some of them with you and the group. But first I think we'd all benefit from knowing more about your uses of the outliner.
