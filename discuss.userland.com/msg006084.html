IE5 is mildly paranoid (although quite rightly) about downloading XML files from different servers that you originally requested the file from.<p>

If you want to view the demo, you'll need to change your IE5 Security settings to Medium-Low or below (either as a global default or through the Trusted Sites group).<p>

In short, if the IE5 security settings are set to:<p>

<table>
<tr><td><b>Setting</b></td><td><b>Result</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>High</td><td>Failure</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>Failure</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium-Low</td><td>Prompt whether you would like to download</td></tr>
<tr><td>Low</td><td>Silently download</td></tr>
</table><p>

In any case, I've added a quick error message which detects for this -- please try again at <a href="http://clippings.cameronmartin.com/xml/">http://clippings.cameronmartin.com/xml/</a> and let me know if it's working for you this time.<p>

Now we've just got to figure out some XML-RPC calls that we'd like you to support without getting too fancy...<p>
