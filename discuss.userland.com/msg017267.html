"Open" in open source generally means "freedom to use, modify, and redistribute".<p>

"Open" in open standards generally means not controlled by a single interest, and occasionally means suitable for a variety of different uses ;-).<p>

AFAICT, merely <i>publishing</i> source, an API, or a standard does not make it "open" in any real sense.  The ISA bus and Win32 APIs, for example, are not open, whereas the PCI bus and POSIX APIs are.
