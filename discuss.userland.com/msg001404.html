Boris turns to his wife, Natasha, and says "I think it is raining." Natasha replies that it was just snow.  "No" Boris yells, "It was rain." And so it continues. <p>

Boris and Natasha see a comrade named Rudolf coming their way.  "Let's ask Rudolf what he thinks." So Boris and Natasha explain their situation to Rudolf asking whether he thought it was rain or snow.<p>

Rudolf exclaims, in certainty, that it was rain, not snow. "It's rain not snow," he said, and walked away.  <p>

But Natasha is stubborn! She turns to Boris and says that she is still positive it was snow. And then Boris says to Natasha..<p>

Excuse me but.. Rudolf the Red knows rain, dear!<p>
