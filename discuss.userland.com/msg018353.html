Excerpts from the WMP 7.0 Beta FAQ:<p>

Consumers can copy entire CDs to their PC in just a few minutes and even listen to the CD as it's being recorded. Windows Media Format audio files give consumers CD-quality audio at half the file size of MP3.<p>

Integrated client support for Secure Digital Music Initiative-capable Windows Media rights management technology delivers a simplified consumer experience from purchase to playback of digital media, without the need to download additional plug-ins.<p>

The new Player includes Windows Media digital rights management (DRM) technology, just like our current 6.4 version does today. This technology provides an end-to-end solution for encrypting and distributing digital content in a secure manner on the Internet. Consumers obtain a license "key" from the distributor to play back the encrypted content. This key is provided by the Windows Media Rights Manager under the terms specified by the content provider.<p>
