At one point in the conversation I whipped out my outliner and made a list of three things I think every home page should cover as quickly and succinctly as it possibly can. This is what I typed into my outliner, customized for Bernie's site, combined with my vision for it..<p>

<ul>
<li>Who you are<p>

I am a game designer and a group leader for idea processing. When I do game design in a group setting I've learned a lot about how to get more juice from the people in the meeting. I switched careers and now I like to practice technography and teach others how to do it.<p>

<li>What this site is about<p>

It's updated frequently. Every time there's a significant article on the subject of collaboration and technography on the web, I will point to it from the news page. If you spot an article that I haven't linked to, please send me an email. You might want to come back to this site every week or so if you want to keep current.<p>

<li>How I can participate<p>

Also, if you have a question, or want to share an experience you can post a message in our discussion group. Please stay focued on the subject of technography, and also be aware that this is *moderated* dg, so I might blah blah blah.
</ul><p>

That's it, nothing profound, but I wanted to make a record of this so I can refer to it as I work on *my* site.</li></li></li>
