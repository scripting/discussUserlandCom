The purpose of the survey is to find out how many open source developers read Scripting News and participate in the surveys.<p>

So how do I ask the question? At first I thought it should be a simple yes-no. But then I got hung up on agreements. And how much of a contribution do they make? <p>

So I'd like a page that defines what an open source developer is, for the purpose of this survey only. I'll point to that page from the survey itself.<p>

If possible, I'd like Eric to write the page, after getting feedback from the rest of the folk here.
