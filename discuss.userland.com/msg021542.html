If you had bothered to follow my earlier threads, you would see that I was merely pointing out that this <b>is</b> a force.  Now as for your interpretation of my cynicism; that says more about you than about me.  While I refuse to ignore the facts or live in a fantasy land that says that rich does not become more rich, that does not mean I am being cynical.  If you really cared to know what I think, you would very clearly see that I consider this a problem and spent a good deal of time trying to provoke discussion about how to fix this problem (read my earlier posts in the thread).
<p>
Saying that it is not a problem is making yourself powerless to influence it.  The problem will always be here.  We need to do something to address it.

Cheers,<br>
Joshua
