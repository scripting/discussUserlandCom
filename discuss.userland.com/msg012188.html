This was probably in the late 70s or early 80s. Anyway, the idea was tried once, and flopped.<p>

Personally, I really like Joe Morgan, and I like Bob Costas. During the regular season Jon Miller and Joe Morgan are one of the best teams in the business.<p>

I've actually been fortunate in my "baseball fan" life. I used to live in Dodger territory, where I got to listen to Vin Sculley, and now I'm in Mariner territory, where I get to listen to Dave Niehaus. These two have very different styles and personalities, but both are the type you bring a radio to the game with you, so you can hear them. There's no better compliment than that.
