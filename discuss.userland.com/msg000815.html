I really like it.  I just wish that I could use with my browser's "mailto" links.  It would be really nice if I could set up my browser to use it.  <p>

If the various web-email places could decide on a simple standard, then the browser makers could just send it a simple redirect when it gets a "mailto" link.  <p>

I can see a neat use for XML here if web mail and web browser makers agreeing on a standard.  I know that if I had a little better integration between Netscape and Netcenter Web-Mail, I would would switch all my mail over to Netcenter in a heartbeat.  :-)  <p>

P.S.  Just a general rant, I hate firewalls that restrict SNMP going out.  I also hate that I can't use MS-Exchange server to "bounce" email off of it like I can with Sendmail.  Maybe you can and my sysadmins just restricted it.  Either way I still hate it. ;-)  I can't use Eudora or anything because it can GET mail with POP, but needs SNMP to send the mail, and I don't have access to an IMAP server either.  Life bites...
