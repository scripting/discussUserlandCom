Thanks for writing to us at Amazon.com. 
  
If you would like us to close your Amazon.com account, please write
back with some information about your last order (a title or two would
suffice) so we can verify that it's your account.<p>

Once your account is closed, it is no longer accessible by you or
anyone else.  Please note that if you have an Auctions account, Member
Page, Wish List, or you are an associate you will no longer have
access to your account for these purposes either.
 
You would need to start a new account if you wish to order more titles
from us, participate in auctions, or to take advantage of any other
features on our web site which require a password.<p>

If you simply want a credit card removed from the list of payment
options on the order form, you may write back to us with the last five
digits of the card.  This way, you will not have to open a new account
to continue ordering from us.<p>

On February 22, 2000, Amazon.com was awarded patent #6,029,141.  The
patent application was filed on June 27, 1997, and generally relates
to an Internet-based referral system such as Amazon.com's
industry-leading Associates Program.  The Patent Office reviewed our
submission in view of information existing prior to our application
and determined that our invention was patentable.  The Patent Office
determined it was patentable, not Amazon.com.<p>

Patents are designed to encourage innovation.  They are an important
part of our intellectual property portfolio, as they are for any
company in the high-tech field.<p>

It is Amazon.com's policy to refrain from speculating about or
commenting on potential future business strategies.<p>

Full information on the Amazon.com Associates program is available at
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/associates">http://www.amazon.com/associates</a>.  The patent is accessible through
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov">http://www.uspto.gov</a>.<p>

We appreciate feedback from customers about all important issues
concerning Amazon.com, and we carefully consider all viewpoints
expressed. Please don't hesitate to contact us should you have any
further questions.<p>

Best regards,<p>
