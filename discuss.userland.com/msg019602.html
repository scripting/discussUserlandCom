You can only view it by itself if you disable JavaScript before you click on the link. In IE 5 you do that in the Tools | Internet Opions menu in the Security Tab, Custom button, by disabling Active Scripting. In Netscape I think there is an option to disable JavaScript. Of course then you have to turn it on again before you go to a page that legitimately uses JavaScript.<p>

I run <a href="http://www.adsubtract.com/">AdSubtract Pro</a> (formerly Intermute) which lets me turn stuff like that on and off with a couple of clicks without fooling around with browser settings and also blocks ads and other annoyances, customized by site. It comes in handy when I hit a web page that thinks it knows better than I do what my Web experience should be. Or when a search engine takes me to one of those porn pages that tries to make the back key pop up endless affiliate porn sites.
