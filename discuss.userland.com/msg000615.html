I would like to ask if anyone has investigated the idea of using Frontier on Windows95 to work with Microsoft Project98, a project management application. I'm still pretty new to Windows95 and Project98 as well.<p>

What would interest me is the ability to automate a lookup scheme that based upon certain criteria, copies project information from one template to a master template with linking intact in both directions.<p>

Any help would be appreciated if sent to <a href="mailto:dwlarson@sd.znet.com">dwlarson@sd.znet.com</a><p>

Thank you.
