Wine is not an emulator in that it implements a library as opposed to emulating an envrionment. It's sort of the difference beween win32 on NT and 95. Same API, different implementation.  <p>

There are actually 2 sides of Wine: a compile time set and a runtime set. <p>

It is my understanding that if you compile your win32 app against the compile time libraries, then you have a native linux binary that can then be run on any [x86 afaik - es] linux system. This is probably the preferred approach if you have access to the source of the application and the expertise to fix what errors occur.<p>

The other side is the runtime libraries, which you can use if you are trying to get an app for which you don't have the source working under linux. For the record, Frontier did not work under the Wine runtime libraries as of January.<p>
