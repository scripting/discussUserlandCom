to RSS. What are they?</i><p><p>

Here are a few off my "A" list. I'm certain there are more I've got scribbled down
somewhere. Let me list these, then some ideas on possible fixes.<p>

<b>Problems/Requirements</b><br>
<ol> <li>Text in title and description tags doesn't have a specified encoding
scheme and an allowed set of entities beyond what XML tolerates.<p>

<li>The "description" portion of an item has poorly defined semantics under 0.91.
The payload type is unspecified and there are no provisions for specifying one.<p>

<li>Multiple titles and descriptions could be allowed for a single item, assuming multiple
content type or encoding schemes are presented (allowing for multilingual versions, plain
text vs. mark-up, etc. to all appear in a single RSS document (more in a sec on this.)<p>

<li>Information about updates, availability, and frequency are not particularly
useful in their current form. 
</ol>
<p>
<b>Some recommendations</b><p>
<ol>
<li>It should be explicitly stated that the default type for text data in titles and
descriptions is the equivalent of the text/plain MIME type. There are dozens of 
RSS sites on the net that intermingle HTML, multibyte characters, and all sorts of 
other unexpected stuff in what would seem to be plain text.
<li>I'd propose adding two additional tag attributes for title and description tags:<br>
contentType and encoding<p>
contentType would contain the exact same information as the content-type field in a
HTTP header, i.e., the MIME type of the payload data appearing between the appropriate
begin and end tags. The default contentType would be text/plain if unspecified. encoding
specifies what transformation(s) may have been performed on the content to get it
into a form acceptable for inclusion in the XML document. e.g., a description payload
might contain content of type text/html and need to be encoded using something like base64.
The default encoding would be that of the enclosing XML document (generally none beyond the 
character set selection.) The only other alternate encoding of any significance would 
probably be base64.<P>
Here are some examples:<p>
<pre>
<!-- initial RSS prolog omitted for clarity --&gt;<p>

<item&gt;
    <title&gt;This is just a title</title&gt;
    <description contentType="text/html" encoding="base64"&gt;
    	ncajwqJK Imagine base64 encoded HTML here sdwef=
    </description&gt;
</item&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The only problem with this is that the new content is not backward compatible with 0.91
RSS viewers. It would be parsable, but not legible. The value of this is immense, however,
because it would become possible to embed images and other non-text content in RSS files.
We already do this by convention in the RSS renderer in go'trieve, allowing the last item
to contain a base64 encoded image that we treat as a GIF to be delivered with the content.
It'd be nice to do this under the auspices of a standard.<p>
<li>The concept of multiple variants of content in titles and decriptions may be a bad idea....
<li>Sites need a way to better inform RSS consumers (agents) about the update frequency of content.
0.91 only allows you to specify days and times when content is being updated, but not anything
about how frequent agents should check back. With millions of potential users pounding a site for
updates, managing the update frequency becomes a critical issue for sites to be able to control.<p>
</ol>
There may be some additional metadata that could be useful to automated RSS consumers such as
alternate download locations, etc., but that stuff falls onto the "B" list. The content type is
my biggest requirement. As it stands, I don't even think the RSS 1.0 draft addresses it (from
my quick reading of it last night.)
