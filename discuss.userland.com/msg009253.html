He seemed most confident that people would continue to pay for services even if 'Free' services of at least equal value are offered in the marketplace.<p>

It seems to me that the "Free' label always attracts folks in some fashion. AOL's shares dropped over 3 points on that news from Microsoft.<p>

Apparantly the COO has most of his compensation tied-up in AOL stock options. If AOL continues its stock drop, he find out how 'Free' affects his portfolio.
