Well, if that were a deal-stopper, we would have heard by now. The screaming by Manila users who can't update their sites would be deafening. I think for all practical purposes, all browsers send the Referer attribute, so in this case, problem solved, afaik.<p>

However, I do agree we could use some help from the browser guys, and I also doubt we're going to get it.
