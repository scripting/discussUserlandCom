I had the same problem, and tried your download links, Dave.  The download stalls repeatedly, and I end up resuming many times to get the big htmlInterfaces.root file.  I finally downloaded the complete file, but when try to login at <<a href="http://localhost/htmlInterfaces/logon/">http://localhost/htmlInterfaces/logon/</a>>, I get an error message that says:<p>

<I>Sorry! There was an error: This database has a damaged free list. Use the Save a Copy command to create a new, compacted database.</I><p>

Is this from a corrupted htmlInterfaces.root?  Since the original download was probably bad, I won't try recovering it.  I'll wait until Nirvana is released and the download problems are solved.<p>

FYI: I also have the problem of incomplete pages, especially from discuss.userland.com.  I have had these problems with MSIE 4.5, Netscape 4.05 and Anarchie Pro 3.5, all on a Mac.  I'd be glad to help trouble-shoot the problem.
