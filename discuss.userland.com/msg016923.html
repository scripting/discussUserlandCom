Instead, vast resources are spent to create a layer which mimics a lot of the underlying OSes features, but does a very bad job at it. A lot of the Hype was about how Java would make an OS obsolete. That made Microsoft the enemy. Wrong Problem, wrong solution.<p>

Before you ask: Top three Java problems: performance, performance, performance.<p>
