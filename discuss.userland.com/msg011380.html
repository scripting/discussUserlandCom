Well, I checked search.userland.com, and no dice. my.userland.com is not part of the search. (I tested to be sure, doing a search for <a href="http://search.userland.com/default?m=25&s=1&q=redmonk.net">redmonk.net</a>.) The only result was from my recent DG post about CompUSA. No content from my.userland.<p>

So, I tried <a href="http://newssearch.userland.com/default?m=25&s=1&q=redmonk.net">newssearch.userland.com</a>. This returned one link, to redmonk.net, also about CompUSA. This one I can't tell where the link came from.<p>

So- my thoughts. It would be great if one could search the content at my.userland, and if desired, specify a news source to limit the search to. This way, since I run a static-only site, could let people search for content that I've generated over the last while.<p>

Perhaps this isn't high on UL's priorities, or not in UL's interests; I just think it's an interesting idea and thought I'd share it.<p>
