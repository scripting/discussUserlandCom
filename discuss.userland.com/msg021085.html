Most people,except a few downright stupid ones(no moral judgement there :-), use the LGPL...</i><p>

(LGPL == "Lesser GPL" or "Library GPL")<p>

Yes. This is the cooperative thing to do.<p>

<i>A Note to the other poster who was worried that GPL + BSD = GPL, that isn't precicely true.</i><p>

From the silly-legal-theories department, courtesy of RMS himself:<p>

<blockquote><i>
So if you want to write a non-copylefted application, release it under
the X11 license, and link it with a GPL-covered library, that is
allowed. The linked executable would be covered by the GPL, of
course, but the app source code would be covered by the X11 license
alone.
</blockquote></i><p>

This theory is legally plausible, but way beyond the attention span of the average judge. This theory <i>also</i> conflicts with some of RMS's <i>other</i> legal theories, as far as I can tell.<p>

As far as I'm concerned, this license stuff is silly. ;-) And I'm more than a little annoyed by GPL'd libraries.<p>

Cheers,<br>
