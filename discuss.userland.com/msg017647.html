There are other players around MS with weight - Ballmer and Allen to name two. You could well be right with or without them: gut feelings are notoriously unreliable, especially given the poor Chinese food here in the Catskills.<p>

However, Gates is acting suspiciously like someone whose own internal set of "principles" have been attacked. He really does believe the innovation narrative (IMO) and may consequently believe that something of ethical value (as he perceives it) is critically at stake.<p>

Perhaps more to the point (and this leads into discussion of your own article) - what is the nature of a settlement that will be (could be) truly satisfactory to both .gov and MS? Another way to read Gates so far is that he finds the current alternatives so unpalatable that he figures he might as well go "all the way" to the Supreme Court ...
