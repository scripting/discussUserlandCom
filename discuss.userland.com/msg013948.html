It's a two-part job. The first part is to use the following macro instead of putting the <SCRIPT&gt; tag directly into the template:<p>

on hitcounter () &#123;
	local(pta = html.getPageTableAddress());
	local(txt="");
	txt = "<SCRIPT LANGUAGE=\"JavaScript" SRC="http://hitcounter.yourdomain.com/counter.js$" + pta^.url + ""&gt;</SCRIPT&gt;";
	return txt&#125;<p>

The second part is also simple. Edit the counter.js script, replacing the two instances of "requestheaders.referer" with "pathargs".<p>

The net result is that the URL of the page containing the &#123;hitcounter()&#125; macro is passed to the counter.js script, which logs the hit against the supplied URL.<p>

I also tested it with iCab 1.8, but since it doesn't currently support JavaScript, it's effectively a noop. I guess this means that there are limits to how accurate the hitcount can be, depending on the browser in question.<p>

You can see an example of this setup at <a href="http://web.webwerks.co.nz/">http://web.webwerks.co.nz/</a> -- look for "Page Views" the very bottom of the page.
