Right on! I find myself, as a designer/geek, exploring dynamic layout much more- it's all relational. I can't control the size of my user's window, but I can specify that I want my nav bar 8 pixels fom the right edge of his window- <i><b>wherever</b> that is.</i> <p>


In print, we had control over what went where. Now, on the web, we're rediscovering the principles of design, in how the reader/user perceives information, and doing it in a changing environment. We begin to spec relationship, not location.<p>


It's <i>so</i> cool.<p>
