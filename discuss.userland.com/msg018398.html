HTTP).<p>

If you had a .m3u file with two entries: the MP3 file to play and a second blank one-second .mp3 file. When the first song finishes playing and then the player requests the second song via HTTP. Then Frontier/Pike can spot the request and create a new .m3u file with the next song along with the dummy request. Then launch the player with the new .m3u file.<p>

Or you could just use Pike to render a regular .m3u file and send that to the player (Winamp, Windows Media Player etc.)
