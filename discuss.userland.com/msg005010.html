Anway, is there an automatic way of turning on the style A:active, A:hover text decoration stuff. I'm sure I read a blurb about it...<p>

Suggestion. I spent (ok, far too long) looking for a way to return just a glossary patched url (no a href). I found that if I give glossSub("page","") no value for the text it gives what I want. This should be documented somewhere else besides the code.<p>

Thanks
