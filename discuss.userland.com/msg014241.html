They don't seem to be too worried about security. Clicking on edit this page allows me to edit this page, save it, and have the changes stick.</i><p>

Yes, on this page <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ManilaByDaveWiner">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ManilaByDaveWiner</a>, they say <i>"...spirit of the WikiWiki community, where the inmates run the asylum..."</i><p>

I find it interesting that people haven't destroyed useful information because of lack or security. Fascinating when you see people playing together nice like this without rule enforcement.<p>

btw, I did a search on UserLand for Wiki and only then realized that this topic was covered on the DG a couple of times before (1999-Feb-02 and 1998-Dec-22). I should've done a search first and appended posts to those discussions. :/ I know adding new topics should be done with care.
