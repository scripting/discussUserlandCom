I didn't vote in the silly personality survey you had up here a couple of weeks ago; <i>who do you like better, Dave Winer or Tim O'Reilly.</i> Sheesh, how silly can it get? And look where this has escalated to.<p>

Isn't it logical to expect that once you ask this kind of question, someone, somewhere, will write up a comparison of your personalities? The survey asks a personal question, so I would expect all kinds of personal answers..<p>

And where more natural to post that comparison than here? :) And by the way, this comparison might not be flattering to you?<p>

Sheesh. Just my $0.02.<p>

There's some really good vacation deals on Priceline just now (hint) :) Or we could do another "group hug" :)<p>
