What's the connection between SOAP and <a href="http://www.jabber.com/">Jabber</a>? It would be great to get a comparative review of these technologies by someone who's knows XML. Could Jabber have a SOAP interface? If so, what would it look like? Does it make sense from the Jabber developer point of view? What would be the win? I don't have time to dig into this myself at this time but am interested in reading a comparison of the technologies.<br><br><a href="http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0103&L=soap&F=&S=&P=10924">On the SOAP mail list</a>, Noah Mendelsohn provides a twist to the usage scenario for IDLs. He suggests using them to generate scripting interfaces on the server side, not just the client side. This could work and might be useful. I'm going to post a pointer to the XML-RPC DG.<br><br>Now, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/p2p2p2p2p2p2p2p2p2p.net.gif">you too</a>, can be part of the P2P2P2P2P2P2P trend.<br><br>The world's best-kept secret. There's <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/xmlextras/">SOAP 1.1 support</a> for Mozilla. Update. We now have 37 SOAP 1.1 implementations in the SoapWare  <a href="http://www.soapware.org/directory/4/implementations">directory</a>, maintained by <a href="http://www.soaplite.com/">Paul Kulchenko</a>. And now I don't have to count them by hand, each page on the directory says how many items it contains. A small convenience. Also each page links to its OPML source through the white-on-orange XML icon. <br><br><a href="http://frontier.userland.com/ourFavoriteSongsRoot">The first source release</a> of OurFavoriteSongs.root, the software that runs the cloud that connects Radio users. It's a Frontier 7 application. Lots of cool stuff here, including vestiges of our music cloud.

I think we're there. It's not perfect, there are bugs, but we believe that it will install and start reading news on almost everyone's system, Murphy-willing. From there it's quite stable. I've been using it without a hitch for over a month. I'm starting to use it in new ways, which is a sign that we're out of the bleeding-edge zone. It's still for technically savvy people, but you don't have to understand its innards to get the benefit. <br><br>To be comfortable with Radio, you should have a basic understanding of how the Internet works. If you know the difference between a Web browser and server or know your IP address, or (even better) know how you got it, you should be fine. We have a friendly <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/radio-userland">mail list</a> and <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/">discussion group</a>. There are several hundred people using Radio to read, write and route news. In the next few weeks I hope to grow that to several thousand.<br><br>With this release we're going to redefine what we do at UserLand. I feel we now have a complete platform. We have hit the top of the tree we started to climb in 1996. Sure, we'll add more ornaments, but our most important work will be grooming, fixing bugs, improving performance and docs. With the focus on desktop websites, and the growth of SOAP and XML-RPC, the position of Radio is clear now -- it's our outpost on the desktop in the new distributed network that's growing so quickly. This is a good strategy because we're leading in this area. The product fits our role in the industry, after years of patient waiting and developing, I think we're now in our "zone". We have the best application development platform for SOAP and XML-RPC. It's here now, ready for developers. <br><br>Note: When it's ready for you to download I'll put the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/radioMugOnGrey.gif">coffee cup</a> on Scripting News as a permanent fixture.<br><br><a href="http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/2001/03/07">Scoble reviews</a> Microsoft FrontPage XP.
