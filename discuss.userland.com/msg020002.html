I believe that OpenSource is great and fine, but I also feel as a developer that I should be able to write and sell my software for a fee.  I enjoy recognition, but I also would like to make money.  As a single individual, I can't do that (make money) by providing support - at least not what I would consider good support.  I think the best way to actually make a profit is to sell the software (be it as a "boxed" product, one time fee, or subscription, or whatever).<p>

I'm a dreamer and idealistic most of the time, but I'm being realistic here.  I have a wife and two kids - I have to support them.   Currently I work for someone else.  I would love to work for myself, but that won't happen if all the software I release is released as open source.<p>

Linus Torvalds is an exception at the moment.  He released Linux as open source, he doesn't make his money off the software, he makes it from is noteriety - speaking, books, etc. (hmm, books, should they be open source too?).  However, not every software developer can become a "field expert" like Linus.  Not every software developer can become so well know and/or wanted that they can make a living traveling and giving speaches.
