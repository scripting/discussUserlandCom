I've had a slightly different experience here in Canada. My cable-based ISP (Videon) actively supports server use, for an additional fee of course. <p>

But they accept that there will be bandwidth-pooling problems and have commited to upgrading their network to keep the "pools" small. True to their word, my throughput has improved consistently over the last year and a half (I check it every month).<p>

My local ADSL providers have made no such commitment. It seems to be more of a cash-flow issue than any limitations with one system or the other.<p>
