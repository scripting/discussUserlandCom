Optionally once a month a Userland person could post a note saying how you feel our pain. Neither one has to be from you, Dave. <p>

Good support feels like it is more important to me at this moment than piling on new features. I'm still trying to find time to appreciate all the nuances of the my.userland and my.prefs releases. Bug fixes are appreciated at all times, particular when they are critical to Frontier 6 working in my environment. <p>

Sounds like you have the beginnings of a success disaster. Not a bad problem to have! Keep up the great work...
