At <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet">Davos 2000</a>, King Abdullah of Jordan said that peace is something we must have in our generation. Shimon Peres said "Peace is hard work." To see it unravel in such a short period is disheartening. <br><br><b>Microsoft & P2P<a name="microsoftP2p">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/29#microsoftP2p" title="Permanent link to 'Microsoft & P2P' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Microsoft & P2P' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	This afternoon I'm flying to Seattle to participate in an all-day design preview at Microsoft for P2P technology. These meetings of high-tech CTOs are like mini-Davoses, Microsoft always gets interesting groups of people together, and the offline talks are every bit as interesting as the on-stage talks. The meeting itself is on background, so I won't be able to talk about what takes place there, without permission from Microsoft. <br><br>	Our work in P2P is wide-open and available to be talked about, or implemented, by anyone. The most concise statement of our plan is in a letter to Eric Kidd, <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1217">posted</a> this weekend. It describes a cloud that connects authors and users with resources via XML-RPC (or SOAP or http-post). Given the rate of development in the XML-RPC-in-C world, I would not be tremendously surprised if this software was deployed before the end of the week. Lurking just over the horizon is the P2P conference in mid-February which everyone, ourselves included, is getting ready for.<br><br><b>Final look for Radio<a name="finalLookForRadio">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/29#finalLookForRadio" title="Permanent link to 'Final look for Radio' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Final look for Radio' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	Over the weekend we finalized the top-level user interface for the first "real" release of Radio UserLand.<br><br>	To mark the occasion, here's a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/radioUserLandFinalLook.gif">screen shot</a>.<br><br>	Yes there will still be little tweaks and fixes, and we've yet to produce a build that has this functionality baked in, but we should make it in time for the P2P conference.<br><br>	Lots more to say, of course.
