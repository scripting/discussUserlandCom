Our seats are in <a href="http://www.sfgiants.com/photos/pbp_seasontix_600.jpg">section 113</a>, directly behind home plate. Row E, otherwise known as fifth row. And there's more! You'll be attending the game with <a href="http://www.dmz.com/dmz/canter.html">Marc Canter</a> and myself.

I retired them after opening the Discussion Group in October 1998.<br><br>	Yesterday I worked on a new script running in Radio UserLand that does what the Mail Pages used to do. It's nice for me to let the DG take a rest. It's opened a bunch of possibilities that weren't there before.<br><br>	I'm going to work some more on the feature this morning, and if all goes well, I'll send out a DaveNet later (on <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/02#ebxmlWillNotUseSoap">ebXML</a>, SOAP and <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/30#loopingBackToApple">Apple</a>, two mini-essays that ran on Scripting News in the last couple of days) and gather comments in a mail page.<br><br>	People forget that the DG was controversial when it started. The mail pages were good. There's a reason why -- because there was a filter. Now that the tools have gotten better, they can do more of the work for me. And compared to being on the defensive <i>every day,</i> the work of the mail pages seems a lot nicer to me now after two years of michegas.<br><br><b>The Mail Pages are working<a name="theMailPagesAreWorking">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/03#theMailPagesAreWorking" title="Permanent link to 'The Mail Pages are working' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	It came together easily. Great tools make the difference.<br><br>	Here's how it works. There's a new <a href="http://mailpages.scripting.com/2000/10/03">Mail Pages website</a>. When I get an email that I think belongs on the site, I forward it to a special email account. Then, over in Radio UserLand, I choose a command from a new Tool I wrote this morning, it moves the email into an outline on my desktop. I do a little editing and cleanup and save. One command, and the site is updated.<br><br>	The old system was more complex. It was also tightly bound to Eudora/Mac. The new system depends on email to do the interapplication transfer between my emailer and Radio UserLand.<br><br>	So I'm using an Internet standard and a mail server running in Seattle to connect two apps on my desktop. It's pretty fast! (Rube Goldberg would love this.)<br><br><b>Wizzy editing fallout<a name="wizzyEditingFallout">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/03#wizzyEditingFallout" title="Permanent link to 'Wizzy editing fallout' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/jonBerneyBugReport.gif">A colorful bug</a> report from an EditThisPage.Com user. <br><br>	<a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$5713">Ken Dow</a> on the same feature: "Just to be clear, I think this is an excellent and welcome feature, but it really needs to be under the Managing Editor's control." <br><br>	They're both saying pretty much the same thing. After all these years, we can laugh when people take themselves too seriously, and appreciate people who show care, and see both sides. There's a lot of value in saying it nicely, but we can hear people even when they don't.<br><br>	"gandhi"<br><br>
