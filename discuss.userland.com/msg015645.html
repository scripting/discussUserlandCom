Ultimately, it probably would. But until there is stuff to check in and other people collaborating on the work, the current archive is sufficient. BTW, is there an alternate location to download the source, etc. from? The project file(s) that Steve uploaded don't want to work with the version of CodeWarrior I have and I'm definitely not able to take full advantage of the project organization you intended with my homemade project files. (i.e., I need the real project files.) The source seems OK. It's just the project that's boogered up.</p>
