Darn, I thought I was being clever. ";->"<p>

<I>To make up for the loss of that functionality, I've been looking into a package called Festival. It runs on most *NIX platforms, so with a little perl work... it shouldn't be to hard to setup some sort of XML-RPC wrapper around it. I could even encode the MP3 on the Festival host rather than the Frontier server this way.</I><p>

Cool, I'll look into that. If it (or something) works on Linux then it's a matter of waiting for UL to release the Linux port or the Carbonized version for OSX. <p>
