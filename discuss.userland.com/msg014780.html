Newsweek is doing the <a href="http://www.dailydavos.com/">Daily Davos</a> site again this year. <i>Coool!</i><p>

We're <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/davosRouter.gif">moving</a> DavosNewbies to a server with a lighter load. <p>

<a href="http://aila.editthispage.com/2000/01/17">Aila's website</a> is about <a href="http://aila.editthispage.com/shiatsu">shiatsu</a>, which is accupuncture done with fingers, knees and elbows. It's an amazing practice. I did shiatsu for a year, and it really works. I could tell you stories! <i>Later..</i><p>

Salon: <a href="http://www.salon.com/travel/feature/2000/01/22/sled/index.html">Sledding in Davos</a>. "To be in Davos without skis is like visiting L.A. without a car." <i>That's it, I'm bringing my skis.</i><p>

BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_616000/616657.stm">Hubble is Better than New</a>. Excellent. It's as if Earth had its own digital camera! We're all newbies. Excellent excellent.<p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$93">Yesterday</a> and last night it poured and poured. As you might imagine, this fattens the creek. <p>

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/08/28/BeeSeason"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/beetrap.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>Here's a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$94">picture</a> of one of the three world-famous bee traps containing last summer's catch. <p>

New tagline for Scripting News. "Ask not what the Internet can do for you. Ask what you can do for the Internet."<p>

Why change now? In previous DaveNets I have urged <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/08/22/chinesehouseholdrevisited">Apple</a> and then <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware">Netscape</a> to adopt this principle. It occured to me a few weeks ago that we had grown enough to adopt it ourselves. It's our guideline for growth. It's something I think we can all agree on. And those who can't agree, such as Amazon and Geoworks, should be clearly seen as being on the other side. <p>

John VanDyk: <a href="http://vfih.editthispage.com/2000/01/23">Those Dumb Farmers</a>. "I grew up in a town of roughly 6000 people. We were fortunate to live on the very edge of town, and directly up the road from Mr. Kuhl's farm. Mr. and Mrs. Kuhl had no kids of their own but welcomed us after school to call the cows, help with milking, find eggs."<p>

VanDyk lives in Iowa, where they're holding the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/24/iowa.wrap/index.html">caucuses</a> today. This is the first official event of the presidential election process in the US.<p>

Have you ever flown over the midwestern United States? It's an enormous expanse of places that look <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&YY=30947&city=Rock%20Valley&state=IA&slt=43.1917&sln=-96.3307&mag=6&cs=5&newmag=5">like this</a>.<p>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/2000-01/24/051l-012400-idx.html">Washington Post</a>: "It is not just the power of ideas, or even the prestige of the participants, that determines who prepares the program and who goes onstage to give talks at Davos." <p>

Another data point. UserLand paid no money to the World Economic Forum. We are working with Lance on the DavosNewbies website, but that started <i>after</i> I was invited to present my ideas at Davos. <p>
