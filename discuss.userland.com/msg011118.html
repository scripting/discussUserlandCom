maybe, but when he finds himself in court, the author of
such a filter can easily prove that he didn't actually
target Dave's site.  in contrast, TV's modifications are
site specific.<p>

on the other hand, TV's terms of service says:<p>

"User agrees not to transmit through the Service any material that
is unlawful, harassing, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene or otherwise objectionable. User further agrees not to transmit any material that encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national or international law or regulation."<p>

pretty much covers everything, doesn't it?<p>

<i>I mean, is there *any* utility to it? Is the signal/noise ratio high enough to provide any useful content?</i><p>

I spent a little time looking at some of the sites listed in
their "top sites" listing, and the answer to your question
appears to be "hardly".  as you probably expected :-)
