You don't really start making money until you've got a fan base. There are certainly exceptions, people who make tons of money on their first single/novel/whatever, but most people have to pay their dues. Your musician who created the great song probably has some other decent songs in his repertoire, which he can use to get the fans. <p>

Also, as you mention there are ways to finagle it. You can release a low-fi version of the whole song, or the first chapter of the novel, etc. In fact, the first chapter idea has been done at least once, and the novelist who did it made a pile of money. <p>

Not really applicable to Street Performer, but there have been a couple first novelists who released the entire novel to the Net, got a bunch of readers, then got picked up by a publisher who applied some professional editing and sold a bunch of print copies. Which just goes to show there's more than one way to skin this cat, though this one only works as long as the book/record publishers survive.
