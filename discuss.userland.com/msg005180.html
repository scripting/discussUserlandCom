Using PhotoShop on a Mac is quite different than using PhotoShop on a PC. As Dave once said, the mouses simply behave differently. To people who push pixels everyday, there is a significant incentive to stay on a Mac.<p>

Also, installing and uninstalling an application on a PC still bothers me a lot. On the Mac, 99% of the time, all I need to do is do a few drag & drop to the trash.<p>

A PC user wouldn't feel comfortable on a Mac either, even if the softwares that they use are cross-platform. On the PC, the contextual menu almost always allows the user to Cut, Copy and Paste (unfortunately, Frontier doesn't :-( ). On the Mac, very few softwares does that.<p>

Yes, these are all little things, but it's also true that these little things make the users aware of what OS they are using.
