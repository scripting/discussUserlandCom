There's no need to leave the original up there: something along the lines of "[edited 2:35am, 2000-09-12 to clarify a few things]" will suffice.<p>

This isn't based on the premise that you have to defend everything you say, even if you realise it needed further edits. Rather, it's designed to ensure that responses don't appear incongruous, facetious, or simply mystifying. Dave: if you (or anyone else) were to reply to this post, there's nothing to stop me editing the original text in order to make that response appear unreasonable or even plain stupid.<p>

[An extreme example. I post that "Radio Userland is brilliant." Someone replies. "I agree: it's a lot of fun." I change the original to "Bestiality is great." Which is basically a libel by proxy.]<p>

The editing ability of the DG is great because it gives you the power to rework your own words. What's dangerous, though, is that it gives you the power to rework other people's words by recontextualising them. It's something to bear in mind if you don't like the idea of other people putting words in your mouth.<p>

(And I'm sure that it'd be possible to introduce an automated editing timestamp, &agrave; la CVS, to Manila.)
