have come up with an idea for what I think may be a
great "concept" in Manila hosting. <p>

I don't have the kind of connectivity necessary to
start up my own server for this sort of thing, and was
interested in possibly working with one of you out
there that have the expertise for this project. <p>

If you're interested, please email me at
<a href="mailto:owillis@yahoo.com">owillis@yahoo.com</a> Thanks!
