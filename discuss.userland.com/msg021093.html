An interesting hypothetical question.  <p>

Has it ever happened? Can someone cite a single example where this happened?  I just wonder how serious the problem is.  If it happened to me, I might just sell it commercially and undercut the price of the other brand, and thank them for the free marketing.  Or I would make it clear the same code was available for free, and thank the seller for the free advertising.<p>

If I give something away for free, I don't see what I lose if someone else makes money from it, as long as they dare not interfere with my own usage.
