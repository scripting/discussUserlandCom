Sorry, didn't mean to get you upset. Let me explain. I assumed that since the site had an XML interface, that meant you were open to aggregators coming through. <p>

Here's how it works: Every fifteen minutes, I check the XML-ized version of the site to see if a new message has come through. If it has, I download it to my server and email it out to everyone. So you basically get maybe one more hit on the server every fifteen minutes. I don't think this is serious load, but if it is, I can adjust the time to whatever you'd like.<p>

You don't have to worry about mail list manners -- it's a one way street, people only get copies of the messages, they can't respond.<p>

If you have any problems with the service, let me know and I'll try and change it. However, I assumed your servers are powerful enough to handle one or two more hits. If you need more clarification, just ask.
