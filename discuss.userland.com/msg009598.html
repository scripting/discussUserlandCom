All of its data is stored in XML, including its UI layout. Unfortunately, it isn't rss aware and you can't create your own 'ametuer' channels for it.
<br><br>
   I made some changes to the thing, including:<br>
   - removing icons I didn't like, <br>
   - moving around the ticker, <br>
   - adding menubars that have urls attached to them.<br>
<br><br>
I even added a second ticker to display stock data.  The second ticker, like most of the features I used to customize EntryPoint are undocumented, but fairly easy to find by changing the .cfg file and/or modifying images.
