These dinners are fun. Brent is going to pick a restaurant, probably in downtown Seattle. Shall we start at 7PM?</i><p>

Having been to Seattle recently, I would suggest this restaurant:<p>

<a href="http://farsideofmymind.editthispage.com/2000/06/05">http://farsideofmymind.editthispage.com/2000/06/05</a><p>

Not that I could say anything about the cooking, as I never ate there. It has the .com virus, though.<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
