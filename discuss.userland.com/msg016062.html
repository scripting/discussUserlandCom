"So don't do that!" sorts of things.<p>

Skins themselves aren't bad, just particular implementations.  If you think a skin makes things worse, don't use it.  Stick with what works.<p>

We could extend the same argument to say that since people can write bad programs, we shouldn't allow anyone to code.  Okay, so that wasn't strictly fair, but I don't think taking away the ability to do XUL programming will solve any particular useability problem.<p>

Personally, I saw most of the "skins" on Linux and X as an excuse to avoid the problem of coming up with a really good UI.  But at least Mozilla and XUL allows you to do things that really do enhance the user experience.  Like Sullivan.  Or Anthem.  Or the ZopeStudio project.<p>

Or did I miss the point?  I do that a bit.<p>
