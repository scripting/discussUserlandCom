The author of Zope was the one who turned me on to this fundamental difference between Frontier and Python. <p>

Here's the truth, we're both just learning about each other. Instead of putting the burden on me to learn Python, why don't we tell each other about our environments? That could create a very interesting document, a useful one. <p>

Instead of having a vague idea of what the other group is doing, we could identify the unique advantages of each environment, and know better how to build systems that take advantage of them.
