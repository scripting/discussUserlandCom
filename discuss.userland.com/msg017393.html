Tomorrow morning I fly to <a href="http://www.excite.com/travel/countries/italy/florence/">Florence</a>, spend Monday and Tuesday there, and on Wednesday take a train to Trieste where I'll visit with Paolo Valdemarin who is doing a new portal for the city with Frontier and twelve programmers. Then, if time permits I'll spend a day in Venice and then fly to London, hopefully meet with the WorldLink people and then fly home to San Francisco. Exact date of return still not decided, the next thing on my schedule is a roundtable with Australian CEOs at the St Francis Hotel (in SF) on the 31st and then off to Seattle to hear Bill Gates on June 1. All of a sudden I'm traveling a lot!<br><br>Before I leave Amsterdam I have <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$697">some</a> <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$698">pictures</a> to <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$699">upload</a>, of Bernie DeKoven and his friends monkeying around in a coffee shop near the Rijksmuseum today. And also before I leave, let me thank Amsterdam, what a great city, and thanks to the W3C and Tim Berners-Lee for the positive energy and enthusiasm and warm welcome. I came looking for the heart of the Web, and I'm not sure if I found it, but I sure am leaving a piece of *my* heart behind. I had a great time! Looking forward to WWW9 in Hong Kong next May.<br><br>Final question. Why are there no skyscrapers in Amsterdam? (<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$17396">Answer</a>.)<br><br>Looking forward: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$17395">A dial-up ISP in Florence?</a><br><br><a href="http://dave.oreillynet.com/stories/storyReader$22">O'Reilly's Dave Sims on</a> Tim Berners-Lee's closing lunch at WWW9.<br><br>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/national/ill-deathpenalty.html">No Executions in Illinois Until System Is Repaired</a>. "In imposing the moratorium, Mr. Ryan had described the capital punishment system as 'so fraught with error' and said it 'has come so close to the ultimate nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life.'" <br><br><a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/02/15/thePeoplesBusiness">2/15/99</a>: "We kill more blacks than whites, more men than women, and even worse we kill innocent people. It's a hypocritical practice, it's impossible to administer in a fair way, and it's just plain bad karma to kill your own people no matter how horrible they may be."<br><br>
