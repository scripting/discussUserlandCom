I prefer that people *not* send me emails containing confidential or off-the-record information, without in advance determining that I am willing to receive that information under such terms.<p>

If you feel the need to protect your identity or want to make statements whose confidentiality needs protection, get the other party to agree to it first. Or if you *have* to put the request in the same email, put it at the top.<p>

I read the emails people send me, starting at the top and going down to the bottom. I read all of his statements without any agreement of confidentiality, they were on the record, and for attribution. <p>

That's how most people read emails. So literally, I received the information without any disclaimers or agreement to protect his identity or confidentiality. It was part of the thread of this discussion, and it was a key statement. It would have been irresponsible of me to receive it and not publish it.
