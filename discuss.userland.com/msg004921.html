This is part of how an interface is defined to describe the services offered by a server.<p>

Using a <struct>-like method for passing parameters would certainly be useful and would be similar to overloaded methods in an object-oriented language like C++.<p>

I guess you could define the interface to your method as taking a single <struct> which could then be extended in the future. If an old client uses an earlier definition of the <struct> then you (the server) would have to provide default values for any unspecified name/value pairs.
