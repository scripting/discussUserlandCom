What else should I call somebody who writes software? ;-)<p>

As William Crim points out, Stallman has written quite a bit of innovative software in the past thirty years. He wrote two versions of Emacs, one of the best C compilers of the 1980s, large parts of a very innovative (but ultimately doomed) kernel, and countless minor utilities.<p>

He once charged insanely high rates to enhance Emacs and GCC, and he didn't have any trouble finding clients. So he was even a commercial developer once, despite his decidely weird ideology.<p>

IMHO, if Stallman didn't write code, he'd have no business advocating his particular philosophy of software. It's not like he's a nosy magazine columnist--he's a nosy developer. :-)<p>

Cheers,<br>
