The United States, like most free countries, is a constitutional republic with elected representatives and a carefully-designed balance of power.</i><p>

Modern political society, at least since the 1700s, has been contractual: there's a trade-off between the rights that you imbue to the state, and those you retain as an individual. My personal view is that I'm happy to make that trade-off for those things at which the state has proved a successful magistrate and arbiter, such as the National Health Service in Britain. I'm not prepared to make that trade-off in terms of freedom of communication, even if there's no constitutional right to that freedom in the UK. My trust extends so far, but no further.<p>

Dave got clued on Wednesday. It's about encryption. That's why a group of my friends set up <a href="http://www.stand.org.uk">http://www.stand.org.uk</a> at the start of the year, and lobbied for the ridiculous proposals for e-commerce to be scrapped. They're probably going to win the argument.
