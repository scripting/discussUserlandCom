Context: I'm doing a normal rendering of a page to disk from a GDB, like I've done countless times before. I just pasted in a template from a different site, which works there. Now, I'm getting a macro error Semaphore timer expired after 120 sixtieths of a second." When I click "go to", I see the semaphore in question is being locked in system.verbs.builtins.log.addToGuestDatabase(). I'm trying to figure out what part of my rendering process ends up calling this. (If it matters, I'm running 5.1.6, with the Nirvana Server pre-release and mainResponder installed, but the server is not currently running and I'm not using that for this rendering.)<p>

Thanks...<p>
