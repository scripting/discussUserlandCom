Hi, my name is Phil Suh, I do a lot of website automation development with a piece of software called Frontier (<a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/">http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/</a>). I've been lurking on this list because I'm interested in getting Frontier and Dreamweaver to work well together.<p>

Frontier is a content management system that handles all portions of a web site in it's internal database, and then can 'cook' out static HTML files. (It does lots of other stuff as well). It has a bunch of great features that make it a no-brainer for large sites with lots of authors.<p>

Frontier is a development environment--it's a great sandbox for geeks. However, it doesn't have a user-friendly GUI.  Realizing this, the philosophy with Frontier has always been to integrate with the tools web builders use.  For example, Frontier had a really tight integration w/ BBEdit 3.5 back in early 1997.<p>

Anyway, the folks in Frontierland have long dreamed (!) of a great connection with Dreamweaver.  Now with version 2.0, we're trying to explore ways to make that connection happen. We'd like Dreamweaver and Frontier to work together in a couple ways:<p>

1. Use Dreamweaver to create/edit Frontier templates.  Designers could go into Dreamweaver, use a menu to request a template from Frontier, edit it, and using the menu, send it back to Frontier.<p>

2. You know how DW 2.0 can 'lock' certain parts of a page? We'd like to have a locked template that people could enter content into, and this time, from a menu command, send not the template, but the content.  Basically using Dreamweaver as the pretty GUI to enter content into Frontier.<p>

If you're still with me, let me explain how Frontier could talk to Dreamweaver. Frontier contains an HTTP server, and can parse and understand XML.  It uses a very simple, easy protocol called XML-RPC (XML Remote Procedure Calls), which is really useful for cross-platform interapp communication.  If there was a way for DW to do this, that would be really cool. (Frontier also supports AppleEvents and COM/WSH stuff, but a cross platform solution is preferred.)<p>

Some questions:<p>

1. Do Dreamweaver have an HTTP server or client builtin? (I know it does FTP.)<p>

2. Could a HTTP DLL be written to get Dreamweaver to handle HTTP calls?<p>

3. How hard would that be?<p>

4. In what other ways could Dreamweaver send/receive data from other applications? ODBC, SQL, etc?<p>

If you have any random ideas, I'd love to hear them.  Thanks for reading.<p>

Cheers- Phil
