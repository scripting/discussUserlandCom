As I understand it, Java just prevents you from having one particular kind of memory leak involving unfreed memory or pointers. There's nothing stopping you from writing a Java program (be it application, applet, servlet, whatever) that recursively creates objects until the machine runs out of space. Only something like an OS-provided memory quota can reliably prevent that.<p>

In that context, any language that insulates you from the necessity of managing your own memory or pointers has this same advantage. Examples include Perl, Python, Tcl, and even UserTalk, I think. All can still "leak" memory, whatever its content, but all at least keep the programmer away from error-prone direct memory manipulation.<p>

Having said all that, I think that the "no memory leaks" advantage, combined with Java's portability, is still an attractor -- especially for those used to programming in C or C++ where both memory management and cross-platform programming are a chore.  I'm more used to scripting in Perl, though, so neither of those points attract me enough to Java, being adequately covered in my language of choice.
