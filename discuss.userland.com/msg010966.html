BYW, I REALLLY like SOAP. Just finished a first-pass on the spec...I like it! A lot! "Great job!" to everyone involved. You know, an idea to put this in front of a lot of Linux types would be to announce it at freshmeat.net. BIG website of Linux apps, web protocol announcements, etc. It'd really be a good way to get a lot of Linux eyeballs on it.
