<P>
Yes, you can attempt to contribute code to a GPLed project under the MIT X License, and they may even accept it. But the product of that project will still become a weapon against developers' livelihood, and developers still will not be able to profit from their improvements to it.
<P>
Oh, and if it's a "GNU" project, the FSF will insist that you sign over <i>all rights</i> to the code before you accept it. That's correct: while Stallman condemns "hoarding" of code, he does it himself.
