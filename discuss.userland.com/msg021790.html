I'm going to study ICE some more, perhaps attempt an implementation in Frontier and Radio UserLand and see where that gets us. <p>

To be clear, whatever syndication format we recommend going forward will <i>not</i> be called RSS. We've been booted out of the RSS process, and I'm tired of fighting with the new owners of the name, more interested in making software.
