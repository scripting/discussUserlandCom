Whenever I have an TCP/IP session running with our ISP the web server fires up instantly but I want to operate locally. I've tried setting the TCP/IP settings to:<p>

Connect via: Ethernet<p>

Configure: Manually<p>

IP Address: 127.0.0.1<p>

the rest I leave blank<p>

Whenever I try to use this setting, Frontier tells me that it can't start the web server because there are too many open sockets. What should my settings be to get Frontier to run locally.
