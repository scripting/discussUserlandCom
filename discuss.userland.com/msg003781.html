I’m not a programmer, yet learned enough to use its outline-and-render feature to put notes up on the web.  Now I’m writing a paper, trying to think something through with a friend in another state.  How wonderful, I thought, if  he could view my outline on the web and review it as I do, collapsing and expanding it at will.  <p>

Is this possible?  I’m not talking about a full-fledged real-time meeting here, just the first step-  using a browser to collapse and expand an outline that someone else has posted.<p>

I think using outlines in real-time meetings is a great idea, but that the ability to dynamically review uneditable outlines is also a powerful experience.  Expanding and collapsing reveals the topology of the thought or argument being presented.  (The simplicity of that "simple" action is as amazing to me as its power.)
