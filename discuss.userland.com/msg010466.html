Exactly.  A scraper grabs 100% of the headlines from a single source, i.e. a significant chunk of content.  For that reason it is a probable violation of fair use.<p>

In contrast a web log, link or search engine shows a single headline (a fractional percentage) from a source, i.e. not a significant chunk of content.<p>

Further, to scrape a web log is a violation, because the web log itself is an original work and the scraper is grabbing 100% of the web logger's original work.<p>

As Jeremy B. says, of course, with permission it's fine.<p>
