This means that control of the music returns to the hands of the artist.  Dave is right that its not about the money but he is also right that the system needs to provide a mechanism to allow the user to pay the artist.  Pirating in some sense is a cat out of the bag but I think if you gave people a system that was as easy as napster and was just as easy to make purchases from it could be very succesful.  Each song is perhaps individually priced with bundle discounts on the album, whatever - the artists decide their own price and the distribution system gets some nominal fee such as a nickle a song (these numbers are completely naive but you get the idea hopefully).  We also need a method for artists to sell music to those without a computer or MP3 player - perhaps a kiosk in the mall where people can burn their own CDs.  Then you've got a more complete distribution system.  It seems you just need to now get around the promoters and ticketmaster who have all the large performance venues locked up and you would then have a world with no need for record companies and the artists retain control of their art.<p>
