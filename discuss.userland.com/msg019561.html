Is he as contemptuous of the technical community as he assumes the recording establishment is of artists? </i><p>

Well, really. You've got techies unilaterally deciding How Things Are Going To Be, based on various techie-oriented ideologies, and to heck with everyone else. The musicians can work for tips, right? They'll like it, because they do it for love of music, right?<p>

It really does come off as pretty arrogant, especially since so few techies know <i>anything </i> about what it's like to be a professional musician.
