I thought about it some more, and looked at the RSS spec, and realized that it was loose enough so that namespace conflict isn't much of a problem -- very few elements have specified formats.  So hey, it's all text...<p>

The only exception -- I'd still really like to see a date format that's easy to manipulate.  I don't care what it is, but I think it should be easy to write code that can, say, sort entries by the date element, or decide if a given entry is more than a week old.<p>

Course, I'm just one guy. ;)
