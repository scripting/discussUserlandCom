I intend to improve that still, but the difference is marked.  <p>

op.setDisplay made no apparent difference OMM (first thing I tried).<p>

I ended up writing a script that converted outlines to tables, and actually converting the renderers themselves wasn't too hard at all.  Having said that, I love writing in the outline and am sad to have to make this change.<p>

Basic string(adroutline) calls don't seem to be problematic.
