I agree, there are certainly a lot of mindless rantings from slashdot. A good, balanced POV?? Hmmm...well, I can probably think of a few pretty fair ones, at least. They may be biased somewhat towards Linux/OSS, but are certainly not inflammatory.<p>


Oh, and on a totally unrelated topic: I noticed that I (and Seth Gordon...I caught that, Seth! *grin*) was having problems emphasizing text (into italics) with <EM>, and wondered how people were doing it until I went to the help page and noticed that <EM> is not supported, but <I> is. It's your site, and up to you, of course, but I'd suggest adding and/or [replacing <I> with] <EM>. It's really the more appropriate markup tag, since it denotes structure...(see this <A HREF="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/fontstyle/i.html">citation</A> from <A HREF="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/">HTML 4.0 Reference</A><p>

<I>The I element suggests that text be rendered as italic text. In most cases, use of a phrase element such as EM, DFN, VAR, or CITE is more appropriate since these elements express the meaning of the text more clearly.</I></i></i>
