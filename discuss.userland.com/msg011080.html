It was called a "translator" which consisted of something like a stylesheet which lived on the client side. It did arbitrary XSL translations so you could transform things like images to little text fields or whatever to minimize download time and such.<p>

An example of a _better(?)_ way to do annotations may be Odigo. Which keeps to itself (doesnt mess with a page at all) but when you go to a page and have Odigo on, you see notes that people have left behind,but only see them in the odigo window as sort of a list of post-its.
Also, any notes only show up to you when that person who posted it is online as well!
