However, I seem to have run into a bit of a snag... I just updated my weblog on my.userland.com- right up to the last minute. I added an entry, but couldn't get the channel text to update itself. The channel text only had the stories up to the one <i>before</i> the one I was trying to add. No matter how many times I hit "update", it wouldn't work.<p>

Then, as the hour rolled over, my new stories didn't appear in the <a href="http://my.userland.com">new stories list</a>.<p>

Is there, perhaps, some work going on behind the scenes which could be causing these oddities? If so, nevermind, and I'll wait for everything to work itself out.<p>

This stuff is really amazing. Dave and Co- thanks.<p>
