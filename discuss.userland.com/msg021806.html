I've been following what you do since I bought a scripting book a way long time ago (on applescript - which also covered usertalk).<p>

You take risks, and you are highly visible, and I respect  you for that.  Dont let the folks who disagree with you tear you down. <p>

Perhaps you should take a month off and go to Fiji or something - the real world is much bigger than the internet :)
