Of course, it's all just a simple matter of using the Manila XML-RPC interface, which also means that it's a very short distance to being able to perform general site maintenance completely through RU, using the browser only for verification.<p>

And thus, we've come full circle, from writing and editing within Frontier, to writing and editing using the Browser, and back to writing and editing within Frontier (RU).<p>

It's all circles, isn't it?<p>
