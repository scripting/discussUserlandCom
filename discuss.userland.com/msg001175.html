A few questions, which I can't yet answer because I'm not at my computer:<p>

1. What happens if nobody is currently logged into the machine?  Does Frontier run at all?<p>

2. Can you _set_ a user that it logs in as, rather than just logging in as whoever is currently interactively logged in?<p>

3. Are there any stability implications?  Any different behaviors?<p>
