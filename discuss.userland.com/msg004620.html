It's very much in the spirit of elm - it doesn't try to be an editor, to decode HTML itself (although it does deal properly with multipart/alternative), or anything like that. It -does- do useful things like thread mailbox messages including expanding/collapsing, support message scoring, mark messages in a mailing list that are from or to you, and integrate well with PGP/GPG and any directory database (not just LDAP or Ph). I use Mutt on 4 mail accounts now, and Eudora Pro 4.1 for Mac on another two, which I don't mind either, but that may only be because I've been using it for so many years.<p>
