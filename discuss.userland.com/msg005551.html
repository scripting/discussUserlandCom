The context of your question suggests that by color correction you really mean one of the various calibrationist schemes such as Colorsynch. Don't worry about implementing such. They are chimeras.</I><p>

Interesting. That makes the problem much easier--no dancing around stupid patents.<p>

<I>Give the pixel pushers in pre-press shops a better than Photoshop multiprocessing application (which MUST include CMYK) that doesn't require NT and watch the Linux boxes sprout like mushrooms.</I><p>

The GIMP is 80% to 90% as good as Photoshop (roughly speaking) in most areas. It's much better for heavy automation, and it runs on some <I>very</I> powerful hardware.<p>

Plus, it's free software. This matters to two kinds of shops--small shops on a tight budget, and shops large enough to employ at least one full-time programmer.<p>

I'll look into the status of CMYK in the GIMP and post a summary this week, time permitting.<p>

Cheers, Eric
