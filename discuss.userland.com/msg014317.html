For the stuff you see when you crank up the AOL client, there are a set of proprietary tools.  For web stuff, there's a whole mish-mosh, but the Digital City folk are using a system built around AOLserver that can flow web content back into the conventional AOL formats.<p>

AOLserver was initially built as a content management system for writers, back when it was NaviPress (Press -- get it?) and NaviServer.
