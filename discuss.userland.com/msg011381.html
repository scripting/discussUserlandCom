Either way, I feel drawn, nay, compelled to post now.<p>

Is anything else going to be going into the Glossary?  As I recall, "Microsoft" is already there, but what about other things we see a lot of, like "Wired"?<p>

I ended up turned off the glossary in my copy of Frontier, it tended to get in my way (snippets of ASP code would get "expanded" when a string happened to match something in a glossary).  I implemented something a little different for my purposes.  This is certainly a cool application of it, though!
