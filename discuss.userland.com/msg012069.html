I was in part misled by the weblog entry for Salon:<p>

Admittedly, I took this as an admission on Dave's part that it was a hoax, and he was in on it. Which in hindsight was not justified, and obviously not correct.<p>

>>We'll certainly find out soon if it's real or not, for the time being, why *not* believe>><p>

My credo is almost the opposite of this: Don't Fall For It. I have a pretty good track record, but I have to admit this occasionally causes me to discredit the creditable. Maybe this, along with competitive urges, is what caused Salon to declare the Wired story a hoax?
