There's no limit. <p>

There's no way currently to update the list, other than by sending me an email containing the URL of the defunct file, or even better, setting the contents of the old file to be obviously null (not maintained). <p>

By the way, I don't say it on the site, but it reloads the channels every hour on the hour.
