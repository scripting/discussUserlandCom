Even better than that IMO would be to simply embed BBEdit as a component <b>in place of the browser's normal textarea widget</b>. MS already has this technology (ActiveX), but in this case they're not using it. The HTML editing component is not good enough, because you have to use ActiveX tags (meaning that your page won't work on other browsers). If I could tell MSIE "whenever you see a <textarea&gt; tag, use this component instead" it would be a much better situation.<p>

IIRC, Mozilla has a unified text editing component that is used for writing email, editing Web pages (Composer), and textareas. It's a pretty obvious idea: If you already spent the effort to write a decent text editor, <b>why not use it everywhere</b>?
