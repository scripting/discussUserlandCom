I'd love to get a discussion going among the non-heavyweight people, talking with Lynn Siprelle this morning reminded me that there's still work to do. <br><br>	We probably need more docs, sample scripts, newbie help, howtos, basic stuff to get people going. I decided to stop fighting. If anything comes of this discussion, we can call our spec RSS-Classic, and let the other people have their way. <br><br>	I also reviewed the comments under the RSS 0.91 <a href="http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$12">spec</a>, and see that there are still <a href="http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$51">some</a> <a href="http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$49">unresolved</a> <a href="http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$47">issues</a> <a href="http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$39">there</a>. I'd like people to feel free to post their ideas, whether or not they understand all the details of the discussions that have been going on.<br><br>	Imho, this stuff is for people who are bewildered by the maze of complex specs that are XML. There are people who think I'm criticizing them when I say that, but I'm an empiricist on this, meaning I've seen the bewilderment, in myself and others. I think XML is important, and it should be easy for people to get in.<br><br>	Now it's no longer a matter of contention. They can have the RSS name if they really want it. I just want to have a discussion with cool people doing interesting stuff.<br><br><b>Napster stuff<a name="napsterStuff">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/13#napsterStuff" title="Permanent link to 'Napster stuff' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Wired: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,38751,00.html">Napster goes on the offensive</a>.<br><br>	WSJ: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2627468,00.html?chkpt=zdnnstop">Can Betamax save Napster?</a><br><br>	<a href="http://www.herring.com/industries/2000/0913/ind-napster091300.html?id=userland">Red Herring</a>: "Powerful entities are trying to gain control of the Internet," says ACLU lawyer Chris Hansen.
