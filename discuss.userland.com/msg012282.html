If I want to put up a daily news feature and then archive those and charge for the archive, I don't want a server offering up an old version of the page to get around my archiving scheme. But otherwise I don't have a problem with these sorts of things because the intent and effect is very different from the Catch the Web program.<p>

Just like photocopying an article keeps me from being at the mercy of having to hold on to the entire newspaper. All of the companies I've worked for usually pay a fee to a copyright aggregrator for the right to photocopy articles for internal use from a variety of journals and have strict policies for duplication of other materials. If a company is going to take something off my site and store it in a database for their employees to recall they had better be paying a licensing fee, just as they would if they photocopied the same article out of the newspaper and made 200 copies to leave for their employees to read.
