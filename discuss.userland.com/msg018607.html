<i>At least he didn't accuse me of taking payments from BillG or being part of the Great Microsoft Conspiracy that supposedly brought down OS/2. That's the favorite pastime of a nut job whose Web site reports on the goings-on in the world of technology, offering up a rare stew of fantasy and paranoia that would make a Lyndon LaRouche blush.<p>

Over the years, this one author has made a particular habit of sending profane, misogynistic notes to female colleagues of mine just for good measure. Incredibly enough, this certain sociopath (sorry, no names) has also managed to land free-lance writing gigs with a few geeky journals. Perhaps that does speak volumes about the standards of certain print publications, but let's save that one for another day.</i><p>

My reading of this is that the part about "sending profane, misogynistic notes" etc refers not to you but to the author of the website devoted to the OS/2 conspiracy theory.<p>

Anyway, no names named, so I wouldn't get bent out of shape because of this slimeball. It's got flame-bait written all over it.<p>
