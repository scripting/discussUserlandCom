Perhaps he should have said "many women" instead of just "women".  Anyone who looks at the polls can see that there is a gender gap relative to support for the President.  Making a statement as to why one thinks this gap exists seems to me quite reasonable. In my opinion, just as reasonable as allowing broad general statements, stated as if they are fact, on the evils and failings of Mr. Clinton.
