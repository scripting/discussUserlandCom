As in the case of every other field where technologies can be made to perform some useful function, using the courts to correct the mistakes of patent examiners is a cost of doing business. It has been that way for a looong time. That's the way Congress has intentionally structured it.<p>

I'm not arguing that it's not a pain. If I didn't see the upside to the patent system, I would agree with you 100%. It's only because of that upside that I'm making these arguments. And it's only because of that upside that Congress has supported the patent system for so long. <p>

(Note, from Dave's postings, it seems that he doesn't want this thread continued any more, and I just now read in the Help file for this group that "postings must be agreeable to the sysop". That's fair, since he has stated  what the policy is. Anybody who wants to continue this can do it <a href=http://garyrob.editthispage.com/discuss/>on my own Weblog</a>. As I'm sure you can tell, this is a very interesting topic to me, and so if anyone wants to continue there, feel free.)
