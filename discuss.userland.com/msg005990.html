This is one example. If all you want is to use KDE, the 'usekde' command is quite sufficient, it can be issued under any console and will allow you to use KDE exclusively.<p>

If you want a flashier approach there are several ways to do so. One is to use a replacement for the XDM login manager that allows you to choose what window manager to use. Another is the solution Steve suggests (that I haven't tried myself). Yet another is to simply write in the window manager of your choice in your .xinitrc or .xsession file, depending on what flavor you prefer, and set up a menu in each of the window managers that allow you to switch on the fly.<p>

As is so often the case under unix, none of the methods are 'more' right. It's a matter of taste. And this is the major hurdle to make everyday desktop users switch to Linux.
