Tim Berners-Lee: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/315633.asp">A Vision for the Future</a>. "The new Web must allow me to learn by crossing boundaries. It has to help me reorganize the links in my own brain so I can understand those in another person’s. It has to enable me to keep the frameworks I already have, and relate them to new ones."<p>

<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$598">XML-RPC Spec for Email</a>: "You can use the information in this document to RPC a message to a UserLand.Com server and have it sent as an email message."<p>

In a true community spirit, <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$599">Eric Soroos posted</a> his initial thoughts for an XML-RPC interface for mail storage.<p>

Here's the Frontier <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1903">source code</a> for the Mail-RPC server.<p>

<a href="http://www.usefulinc.com/xmlrpc/demo/mail.php">Edd Dumbill is the first</a> to support the new email spec, in PHP, both <a href="http://www.usefulinc.com/xmlrpc/demo/mail.phps">client</a> and <a href="http://www.usefulinc.com/xmlrpc/demo/server.phps">server</a>. <i>Schwinnng!</i><p>

Salon: <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/10/14/digiscents/index.html">Surf and Sniff</a>. "Smell-enhanced surfing: It's a concept so bizarre it just has to be a hoax. Imagine stink-bomb-scented e-mail from angry ex-lovers. Online used-car salesman who perfume their Web sites with authentic "new leather." Video games that blast you with the hot stench of alien guts. What a hoot!"<p>

Salon <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/1999/10/14/bathroom_humor/">asks</a> if fart-enhanced email is coming next! <i>I *thought* of it, but I didn't dare say it.</i><p>

I totally want an XML-RPC interface to this <a href="http://uptime.arsdigita.com/uptime/about.tcl">server</a> at Ars Digita.

Brock Meeks: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/322926.asp">Web Site Holders Surrender Privacy</a>. "When Robert Cohen set up an Internet site to sell unpopular political films he was looking for customers; now he’s afraid of the crackpots."<p>

<a href="http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/1999/40/ns-10643.html">ZDNet UK</a>: "For a month or so earlier this year, DoubleClick, an Internet advertising firm based in New York, furtively put up three different editions of its home page. Most visitors saw one version, highlighting the firm's accomplishments. Employees of a rival firm could see only another version, with a special press release touting DoubleClick's capture of one of the rival's customers. Clients being wooed saw only a third version."<p>
