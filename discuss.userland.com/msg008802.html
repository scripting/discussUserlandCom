Freelancers (and moonlighters) "bid" on the project. The site also hosts the freelancer's personal info so that the company posting the job request can see and compare bidders.</i><p>

<a href="http://talentmarket.monster.com/">http://talentmarket.monster.com/</a> is the reverse of what you're looking for: you post your skills, work experience, references, and desired rate, and employers can bid on your time.<p>

It's free for job seekers through Labor Day.
