A thought just hit me.  Redirection tracking is very useful.  It currently has some drawbacks though.
<blockquote>
if the redirection server is down, then the link breaks<p>

the urls get ugly.  even more so if several levels are involved.
</blockquote><p>

So here is my long term idea for handling this.  The anchor tag (perhaps img and others) need to have a new attribute called something like redirect.  It's value would be a list of urls.<p>

Of course the browsers would need to be updated or perhaps a plug-in could handle the task.  The browser when it hit these attributes would send off the href's value to the servers in the redirect attribute.  If a server in the redirect attribute was unreachable then it would be passed over, the user wouldn't be prevented from reaching the final destination.<p>

The handling of how the browser contacts the servers in the redirect attribute could be made fancier.  For example, if a server in the redirect attribute were unreachable, that server could be added to a retry queue.  All kinds of options for handling there.<p>

An example: <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/&quot;"<a href="http://www.salonherringwiredfool.com/&quot">http://www.salonherringwiredfool.com/&quot</a>; redirect=&quot;<a href="http://redirect.userland.com">http://redirect.userland.com</a> <a href="http://redirect.creedon.net&quot">http://redirect.creedon.net&quot</a>;&gt;SalonHerringWiredFool</a&gt;<p>
