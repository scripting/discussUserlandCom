But damn -- I just found out that I'm too far from the call center to get anything beyond the 384/384 setup.  I really wanted the 1.5M/384K deal.<p>

Oh well.  I'm in West Seattle, so I have a cable modem that actually works.  My service will peak at about 5M on the downlink.  So why would I want to go to DSL?  Because @Home clamps the upload rate to 128K, and restricts servers.  And I really want to play with running my own servers.<p>
