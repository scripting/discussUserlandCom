Just read you were going to be in town, and I see you already have a great dinner picked out.  If you are looking for somewhere for lunch and haven't been there already, you should try meeting "the Man" @ Dixie's BBQ(<a href="http://seattle.citysearch.com/E/V/SEAWA/0000/53/16/"><a href="http://seattle.citysearch.com/E/V/SEAWA/0000/53/16/">http://seattle.citysearch.com/E/V/SEAWA/0000/53/16/</a></a>).  Most everyone over here at MS should be able to point you in the right direction.  If you need a ride, let me know.<p>
