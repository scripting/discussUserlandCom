My answer is, you're right.<p>

Just like 'spam' is meat, 'finger' refers to a digit on your hand and 'windows' means glass panes you see out of.<p>

This is an overload of the word with a new meaning. It seems to have caught hold. What's the big deal?<p>

The word isn't even a trademark like spam was; Hormel didn't like the new meaning we've all come to accept, but they haven't been able to stop it either, because it's a very useful new meaning.<p>

Who will prevent this new use? <p>

Is 'weblog' someone's trademark? <p>

And do you have a better word in mind that is as clear and concise?
