Hmmmm. Inquiring minds want to know! What was that all about?<p>

I agree about all the above. We can already do enclosures, but don't have a UI for it from the web browser. Look at the samples site, it's stored in the same structure as this site:<p>

<a href="http://samples.userland.com/">http://samples.userland.com/</a><p>

I can publish some or all of a thread, so can anyone actually, just point to the message you want to showcase, and all its subordinate messages come along for the ride.<p>

I'll think about the rest of it.<p>
