I'm very industrious and eager, so I get out my steamshovel and dig a hole and fill it with water, add a filtration system, a ladder (so it's easy to get in and out) and then when I get bored I invent pool toys, water guns and floats etc.<p>

I'm also a very generous person so when my lawyer comes over in the afternoon and says "Let's patent this!" I say "No, I want everyone to enjoy my invention. I'll get all the satisfaction I need from the emails I get from happy people who are cooler because of my invention."<p>

Everything's fine until one of the users comes up with a neat idea for a new pool toy. It becomes the rage in the pool-user community. (We have our own website.) Unfortunately this person *is* a lawyer and unbeknownst to the rest of us (who praise him mightily for his creativity) he has filed an application with the USPTO to patent the idea. <p>

We have fun with it anyway, and I add his pool toy to my repertoire, and refine the idea, make it happier, and make it work with the ideas I came up with in the interim, and those that everyone else came up with. We're all happy until three years later when he presents us with a piece of paper.<p>

"That's my intellectual property," he says, pointing to the third generation of his pool toy. "You can't use it anymore."<p>

"Bummer," the rest of us say.
