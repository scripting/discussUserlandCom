Anyway #2 would be: media, media, media.  Dave needs to move on up - to a fuller, more richer multimedia experience and he can link in media (audio, video, photos) byt putting in cute little icons that represent that.<p>

#3 - fro all you nerds out there - SOURCE CODE!<p>

So to recap= #1 = definitions (???), #2 = media (little baby video cameras, microphones and photo frames) and #3= source code (hmmmm what would that be?)
