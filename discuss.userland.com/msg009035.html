Frontier developer needed on-site in San Francisco to maintain and enhance
several domains rendered via Frontier.<p>

We currently have one developer working long distance and need
a second to come into the office several days a week. The developer will
join a fast-paced team, working with the Webmaster, a site designer, and a
Perl programmer to keep the sites running smoothly as they are updated.<p>

The candidate will also help develop and install suites to manage content
workflow and automate publishing.<p>

Our sites are stored in Frontier 6 on an NT machine, which renders the pages
as flat HTML, using various macros to automate production. We have a content management intranet served live via mainResponder, and we are in the process of building an automated publishing system in tandem with it.<p>


We are exploring
a possible move to hosting more of the sites via mainResponder. We are
installing an NT Frontier server outside our firewall to handle search
functions for the sites.<p>

Responsibilities include: scripting new macros as the need arises,
structuring Frontier databases to accomodate site designs, and aiding in the
planning of future development.<p>

In addition to UserTalk, a strong working knowledge of HTML 4, CSS and some
Javascript would come in handy. The ability to work independently, as well
as with a team, is very important.<p>
