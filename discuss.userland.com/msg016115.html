I only caught the merest glimpse of your trees story, so for all I know I have inadvertently attempted to challenge what may indeed be a grievance with which I sympathise.<p>

Whatever, I apologise for my negligence in failing to check, and for my impetuosity and egocentricity in writing what I did without making the fact that I had not looked into your original comments abundantly clear before I shot my mouth off.<p>

Please forgive.<p>

Yours mortified and penitent.<p>

Eric
