If I remember correctly, the contract my band had with <a href="http://roadrun.com/roadrunner.html">Roadrunner Records</a> ended up paying us about $0.60 per CD sold, which when divided by the number of tracks on the album (10), works out to $0.06 per CD. That's what the record company's thought was fair for a new artist, at least according to their "standard contract". (Our lawyer actually negotiated with theirs for almost two months, so our deal was somewhat better than "standard".)<p>

It's easy to see how we never recouped our "debt" to the record company, and therefore never made a penny from record sales.
