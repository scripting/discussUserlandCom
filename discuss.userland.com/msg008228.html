However there's a certain class of applications in which a store-and-forward type of messaging is useful. We have a standard protocol for that already - SMTP.<p>

Sample application, just for a taste of what's possible: Having your bank maintain, _on your local disk_, a mirror of their log of all transactions in your account - by sending you periodic XML-RPC E-mail messages to add to it. The messages would have to be encrypted and signed, of course. You could never do this with XML-RPC over HTTP.<p>

What I'd like to see is a standard format for XML-RPC E-mail messages. This touches on the issue of the MIME type of an XML-RPC message (currently text/xml). If the type was something like application/xml-rpc then the above would be pretty easy - E-mail clients already know to redirect messages to handler applications according to the MIME type; issues of security and privacy can likewise build upon E-mail standards.<p>

How about it? Has this been raised before?<p>
