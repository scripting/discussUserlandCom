I know you're no fan of "Dubya";  as it happens, neither am i (tho i don't like "Bush-Lite" any better, and expect to be voting "other" [i.e. Nader] come E-day, FWIW).  I do suggest that, if you want your polling to be taken at all seriously, you pay a bit more attention to the context you create around these questions.<p>
