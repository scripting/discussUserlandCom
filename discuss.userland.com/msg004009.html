It's going to be a busy week. On Monday we're making a syndication announcement with a major portal. This funky website is going some interesting places! And on Thursday Microsoft will ship MSIE5. Glad I got my <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/03/comparingBroadbandHTML#superhonker">SuperHonker</a>!<p>

The SuperHonker is here. Very strange feeling, all this power, but I have to run a different browser, and my old monitor didn't work with this machine. Everything feeeeeels weird! <i>As always.</i><p>

Now I'm off to <a href="http://forums.sthomas.net/frys/">Fry's</a> to get a replacement for my fried monitor. Ain't life funny that way? <i>I hate Fry's!</i><p>

A random link, I was researching something else and came across this <a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/mw_10-16-95/otr.html">MacWEEK editorial</a> from 1995. Gorgeously written. I wrote a <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/10/welcomebackjeanlouis">piece</a> around that time about the return of King Jean-Louis.<p>

We've heard rumors that Frontier 6 will be sold at a lower price than Frontier 5. In fact, we have no plans to change pricing.
