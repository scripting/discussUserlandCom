His people will engage in a giant campaign to:<p>

1. Paint Republicans as extremist Evil Bastards.
2. Continue to practice the policy of outing other politicans in an effort to show "everyone does it."
3. Continue his policy of not completely owning the problem.
4. Continue to do his "aw shucks" routine where he talks about the "work of the people" blah blah blah.  It works for him, so why should he stop?<p>

America disappoints me.  People have bought his "aw shucks" thing over and over again just because they believe the economy is okay.  As if the President had an effect on the economy.  Bush suffered because of a thing he couldn't control, Clinton prospers because of a thing he can't control.  And the next president will suffer again when we go through a down cycle.  <p>

And so it goes.<p>
