What I'm driving at is that once you have the crypto crack, getting at the "guts" that you need to change to do the once-and-for-all patch becomes much, much easier, and yes, I'm definitely thinking by analogy with software copy protection schemes, which went the way of the dodo in the end precisely because once they had been cracked once, generalizing the crack was far more straightforward than altering the protection in some way that made the crack no longer work.
