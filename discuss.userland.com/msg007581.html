I use the Mac to offload tasks from the NT server, things like batch-loading of the RSS files for My.UserLand.Com and sending Scripting News bulletins. <p>

This server is doing all its work in response to XML-RPC messages, and in timed processes running under the scheduler. Frontier has trouble doing this 7-by-24. It runs out of sockets, or crashes in a "GUSI" routine. Whatever. I'm not sure if the problem is in the TCP routines in the Mac, or in Frontier, and to a major extent it doesn't matter. I just want the server to run smoothly and now I think I have a formula that works, and want to share it.<p>

<b>An AppleScript</b><p>

First, I wrote an AppleScript that watches to see if Frontier is running, and if not it launches it.<p>

<pre>
on idle
	tell application "Finder"
		if not (exists application process "UserLand Frontier™") then
			try  
				open application "UserLand Frontier™"
			on error
			end try
		end if
	end tell
	return 10 --run once every 10 seconds
end idle<p>

on run
	idle &#123;&#125;
end run</pre><p>

This script is saved as a runnable application, with an alias in the Startup Items folder so it launches when the system boots. Every ten seconds it checks if Frontier is running and relaunches it.<p>

<b>A Frontier agent that runs every hour</b><p>

Second, I wrote a Frontier agent that quits every five hours.<p>

<pre>
if not defined (scratchpad.cthoursrunning)
	scratchpad.cthoursrunning = 0
if scratchpad.cthoursrunning == 5 
	delete (@scratchpad.cthoursrunning) //signal to reset
	filemenu.save ()
	filemenu.quit ()
msg ((5 - scratchpad.cthoursrunning) + " hours till we quit.")
scratchpad.cthoursrunning++
clock.sleepfor (60 * 60) //sleep for an hour
</pre><p>

I put the agent at system.agents.quitter.<p>

<b>It works!</b><p>

You can see that it works from the log on the home page of <a href="http://my.userland.com/">My.UserLand.Com</a>. It's updating every hour. Now I can move on to tackle other problems.
