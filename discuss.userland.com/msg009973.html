Could you elaborate on this position? What's wrong with LJ? Do they not take input from non-LJ people on article topics? Do they not have Letters to the Editor?<p>

Their website seems to have their content online. Does it not?<p>

How would an Open Source magazine work? I can't imagine any differences in the way it would work. You'd need the same writer-editor hierarchies in order to preserve the credibility of the publication. Direct reader-writer/editor interaction comes in the method of letters/email.<p>

Maybe I'm missing something...<p>
