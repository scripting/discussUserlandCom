We are hopeful that this will be a fairly robust vector toolkit.  Tree charts are one thing, but we want to pass complext technical drawing around, embedding XML data into with the Vetors.<p>

In addition to workflow management, this will begin to support other engineering applications that can use the vector/xml data to perform analysis.<p>

Of course that leads to the question of the object model, 2d vs. 3d. and all kinds of fun with abstraction.<p>

Cool!<p>
