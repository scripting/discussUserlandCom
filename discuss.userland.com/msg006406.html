Good question: G3 desktop w/Adaptec Ultra-Wide SCSI, iMac, 7500, 8600, PowerBook G3 (Wall Street).  Those are the ones I know about. <p>

An updated RedHat Installer should also be available for those who are having trouble with the new installer, and machines that can't boot the live filesystem (non-Power Macs such as Motorola FirePower and PowerStack, IBM RS/6000).
