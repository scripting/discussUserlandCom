Sun may be right that Solaris under the Community license is a kind of open source, but people like Linus may not be terribly interested.  That is the natural effect of a broad definition.<p>

It is interesting to consider what happened with "free Solaris".  The Solaris OS has been free for non-commercial use for a little over nine months.  In those nine months Sun has <a href="http://sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/9908/sunflash.990805.1.html">shipped 100,000 copies</a>.  Those are solid numbers, and I'm sure a lot of people did benefit from free Solaris, but those numbers didn't intude on the Linux story.  There was a choice between "free" Solaris and "free" Linux, and people chose what suited them.<p>

So now we have a choice between "open" Solaris  and  "open" Linux.  That's grand, and I'm sure open Solaris will benefit a lot of people, but I don't see the numbers intruding on the Linux story.<p>
