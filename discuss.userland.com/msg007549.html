New website: <a href="http://linux.userland.com/">Linux.UserLand.Com</a>. <i>Our lab for Linux work.</i><p>

Our first step is to get a solid <a href="http://linux.userland.com/stories/storyReader$18">XML-RPC implementation</a> on Linux. We've been working in the Zope environment with the Python scripting language. <p>

This morning I interviewed <a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/news/discuss/discuss/msgReader$7554">Digital Creations CEO Paul Everitt</a> on the connection between Zope and Frontier thru XML-RPC.<p>

WhereIs WhoIs? We converted one of our membership-based sites to run in Linux. Here's an A-B comparison on <a href="http://whois.userland.com/">Windows NT</a>, and <a href="http://linux1.userland.com/whois/">Linux</a>. <p>

We're publishing source code and tutorials to show people how to use their Mac and Windows skills to deploy scalable applications on Linux. Our focus is on building systems that leverage the advantages of all platforms. We don't have an allegiance to any individual platform. We don't want to see Microsoft or Apple lose. We just want to make great servers and web writing environments and help others do the same. <i>No fear!</i><p>

Thanks to <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/xmlrpc/">PythonWare</a> for an excellent XML-RPC foundation. And thanks to <a href="http://www.digicool.com/">Digital Creations</a> for their help and support. The XML-RPC additions will be integrated into the next release of <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>, which is open source, which we happily support.<p>

<a href="http://www.buckswoodside.com/">This morning we flipped</a> the home page of BucksWoodside.Com. Three new stories, and a <a href="http://www.buckswoodside.com/stories/storyReader$159">picture</a> of Kim Polese.<p>

<a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/fortune/cool/cool3.html">Fortune</a>: "The 7:30 a.m. chatter at Buck's of Woodside--the Silicon Valley breakfast mecca for venture capitalists and entrepreneurs--is all about patents and game plans. Marty Walker, a founder of Frequency Technology, fits right in. He's explaining how his company will change the world. Or at least the world of microchip design."<p>

<a href="http://infoworld.inclusion.net/forums/topics.html?igid=G23&mid=M31">InfoWorld.Com has a new look</a>. Very confusing! I used to be able to scroll down the home page till I hit a visited link and then hit the Back button. I wish they'd do a channel, I'm already getting used to browsing the web thru My.UserLand.Com. And getting ideas for new things we can do with the story-flow. How about a table that showed the stories in reverse-chronologic order with a link to the channel we got it from. It would be a super-aggregate channel. But I wandered a little off topic. <i>Back to work!</i><p>
