Computers a difficult industrial design problem. Great designs come from designing around the function or use of an object. The function and use of a computer is just too broad to make any real meaningful changes unless you limit the function or use. (IBM makes a really nice hand-held win95 computer - limit the intended use and designers can tackle the problem)<p>

The design of the iMac is nothing more than a bright yellow starbust on a box of detergent, it gets people's attention, and they may buy it, but it serves little functionality for the consumer.<p>

Dave, you may want foot pedals, but I want a big 18" by 24" panel that I can use a stylus on. I could work at a desk, on the floor, or on the couch. Just like my old drawing board from school...<p>

I wonder if the computer industry could segment the market based on intended use, and design better forms for the computers for each use...
