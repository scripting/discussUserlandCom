Oslo. They found themselves sharing a carriage with a Teddy Boy - D.A., brothel creepers, drain pipe trousers, the works. One of the men
introduced himself and asked for the Teddy Boy's name. To which he
replied: "It es Olf but vot does it fakin have to do vit you?" <p>

A little taken aback with the curt response, the two men decided not
pursue the conversation any further.<p>

As time went by the Teddy Boy  got more and more restless until he
exclaims "Fuck itt, I am fed up vit you boring bastards, I am going to
ze buffet car to get pissed" <p>

Moments later he busts into the carriage holding a half  empty can of
lager, shouting and swearing about the quality of the beer.<p>

"Oh dear" said one of the men, "I wonder what his problem is?"<p>

"Well its clearly obvious" said the other man, "RUDE OLF THE TED LOATHES TRAIN BEER"
