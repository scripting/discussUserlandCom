Look at how I do it on <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">www.scripting.com</a> which is a static page.<p>

It's the one that gets the most traffic. It's only one page. The dynamic pages, the back-issues, are stored on a dynamic server. They get a lot less hits. <p>

We haven't made the switch, yet, to a fully dynamic site. Yet the calendar is still useful. Unless you're watching carefully you don't even notice that you've switched over to a dynamic site.
