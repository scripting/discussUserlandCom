What I wrote of was not necessarily a compromise, but an industry shared by software developers releasing their software in a number of forms. I apologise for choosing the wrong word.<p>


If patents can be seen as protection for the originator, then look at two situations:<p>

<ul><li>Software without protection: no patents, no copyright, no proprietary code.</li><p>

<li>Software with protection: patents, copyright, open and proprietary code.</li></ul><p>

I think that with a guaranteed protection of concept, code, etc, companies would feel more secure in greater investments, when compared with the same company investing in a product that can be copied outright by competitors and users.<p>

If there is something I'm overlooking, please clarify.<p>

Argue is such a negative word. This is a discussion group. If you're in a better position (ie, as an actual software developer with more research of the industry under your belt), then I would appreciate hearing your perspective on the issues of patents, the various methods of developing and releasing software, etc.
