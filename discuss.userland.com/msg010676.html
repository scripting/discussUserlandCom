Wouldn't it be better to use CORBA for this? I mean CORBA *is* 
object-based RPC. I'm still reading up on this, but my first
impressions are that you are re-inventing the wheel (at least bits
of it).<p>

Of course, there's nothing to say you couldn't have a CORBA interface
to whatever services an XML-RPC server would publish.
