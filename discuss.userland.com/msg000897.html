Whenever an editor logs in, he/she can edit a story, and when the edit goes through, it also duplicates the data in a [storyname].edits.00x table. Then when viewing an article's history, an editor can roll it back to any stage of it's development. Oh- the rollback is appended to the history, so it's really a bring-forward, not a roll-back. ;-)<p>

Thanks Userland for a rockin' toolset.<p>

O.K., I had to go back and change it, just because I can. Oh, and to fix typos.
