<b>An open search engine</b><p>

With over 2700 Manila sites hosted on EditThisPage.Com, we now have an interestingly large base of content and no way to search it. Until now. ";->"<p>

EditThisPage: <a href="http://search.editthispage.com/howTo">How to set up a Manila site for searching</a>.<p>

The interface is open and <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$242">documented</a>, implemented in "XML-RPC", so other content management systems could tie into our search engine, and other search engines could support Manila sites.<p>

A list of <a href="http://search.editthispage.com/sites">sites</a> we index. Some people got in early, by being curious! But wait, there's more. A page listing the <a href="http://search.editthispage.com/popularSearches">most popular</a> searches and one listing the <a href="http://search.editthispage.com/recentSearches">most recent</a> ones.<p>

<b>Regular expressions for Weblogs.Com</b><p>

One of the nicest features on the home page of "Weblogs.Com" is its search command. For example, here's a <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/stats/findinweblogs?q=sxsw">query</a> for all the weblogs that mention SXSW. That's an easy search string to find, it's unlikely to appear in any context other than the SXSW conference in Austin in March.<p>

But what if, for example, you wanted to find all the sites that have the word "cool" mis-spelled, with extra o's and want to find them all in one shot, regardless of how many o's they have? Here's a Regex <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/stats/findinweblogs?q=cooo%2Bl">query</a> that finds those sites.<p>

So that's the little goodie. We're doing a toe-dip. We've not put Regex on a server before, so we're not sure if it's 100 percent reliable. We decided to try it on our newest server, with a crowd that might care and see what happens. There's a <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/regex">cribsheet</a> for Regex, with pointers, please discuss on the Weblogs.Com DG.<p>

Hey back in the 1900s, esp towards the end, I thought how neat it would be to look back on the 1900s, but that was overly self-centered. I almost never think about the 1900s. So there!<p>

In my <a href="http://www.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$34">Let's have a meeting!</a> post I said: "I want to have a Saturday afternoon meeting with the EditThisPage, Manila and Frontier people in the Bay Area."

I'm waiting to hear back on available dates. In the meantime I may have to go to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/meetings/IETF-47.html">Australia</a> in late March, so we'd better do it in the first half of March. Sorry for the confusion! I never thought we could possibly pull it off in just a few days.<p>

<b>Woof woof!</b><p>

I say I don't like Derek Powazek's style of weblog. I say why. Then I get a bunch of links from people who would never link to me otherwise, some of whom even have Weblogs.Com banner ads, and therefore get links from me. "The sky is falling the sky is falling, Dave criticized someone! Helllp. I'm so outraged." <p>

So like <a href="http://www.brainviews.com/abFiles/AniPavlov.htm">Pavlov's dog</a>, I now know how to get links from that crowd, and I might know a few more tricks too. <i>Woof woof!</i><p>

BTW, the only reason I criticized Powazek is that I think his design sucks. I had tried it several times, so I know it had nothing to do with my mood. He preaches about his design skill so mightily. I think he's pompous, a set-up to be ragged on if there ever was one. <p>

And a PS to <a href="http://www.evhead.com/">Evan</a> and <a href="http://www.megnut.com/">Meg</a> at Pyra, two very sweet people whose logs I read regularly, if I had known he was coming to work for you I would have sat it out. <a href="http://www2.bluemountain.com/cards/box7556u/vur3fxdkwdpmdj.htm">Best wishes</a> for friendly respectful competition, that's not what this is about.<p>

<b>About the cowskull</b><p>

Since people mention the cowskull disaster so frequently, I thought I should explain what happened. The cowskull was originally intended to be a mode-flip, to move you from the presentation view to the editorial view of a story or picture in a Manila site, and back.<p>

Somehow this broke during the development of Manila and no one noticed. The other side of the mode-flip, from the editorial view to the presentation view was deleted. This is an internal team issue at UserLand and should not concern anyone else, unless they're interested. So anyway, the cowskull was not correctly implemented. <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware">Whatever</a>. <i>Onward!</i><p>

BTW, it's really silly to pick on this one glitch. Look at Manila as a whole. It's a very large community of users. That couldn't have happened if we hadn't done a lot of things right.<p>
