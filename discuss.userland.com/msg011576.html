OK, I'll take you up on this. What's your proposal on how to implement a non-annotatable Web site using open protocols? You get to design the protocol if you want, but it has to be openly documented. (I assume that's what you're talking about; please correct me if I'm wrong.)<p>

I read Shapiro's dissertation and the erights site and I have written a Web server before, so hopefully that makes me qualified to understand your solution.<p>
