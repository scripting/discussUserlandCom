In most cases I find that I am not the first person to encounter the problem.<p>

I think it might be nice to have a 'FAQ' link on each page of the instructions which would link to a list of questions relating to the current page and allowing entry of a question if one doesn't find the answer already there.  In otherwords, a discussion group linked to each page of the documentation, context sensitive help.<p>

One problem I find with the mail lists is that it is sometimes difficult to follow the entire thread, or maybe the final solution is not listed.  With a discussion group style FAQ, the final solution might be posted as a response at the top level, eliminating a lot of reading for someone searching for answers.
