The WWW9 site isn't clear about where the keynotes will take place, but the exhibition held in conjunction with it will be hosted by the RAI International Exhibition & Congress Centre, so that's probably where.<p>

It might be possible to get some space at the RAI during WWW9, maybe using one of the auditoriums when it isn't used for keynotes...<p>

How may people do you want to fit in there?<p>
