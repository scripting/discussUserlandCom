In the interest of my own satisfaction, I've started <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/the259diaries/">The 259 Dairies</a>, a "blog"-like site devoted to journaling the life of the old Victorian house my wife and I are in the process of buying. <p>

It may not be updated as frequently as a lot of other blogs, but I hope to make it interesting. It's largely for personal and family use, but I'll be writing <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/the259diaries/storyList.html">stories</a> about the process, and collecting <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/the259diaries/resources.html">links</a> to useful home-related sites, and I hope that anyone who stumbles across the site will come away enlightened and with their spirits lifted.<p>

Some may question the wisdom of posting a website actually associated with an address. This is an experiment and the risk is one I'll take. I have access to a really nice SLR digital camera with which I'm going to document the transformation of 259 Florida Ave, and I'll post interesting emails, so anyone who's polite can participate.<p>

Best wishes, and see ya round the net!<p>

P.P.S. Would this be of interest to my.userland readers? I don't have The Diaries linked into the XML thing yet. Feedback to <a href="mailto:259@redmonk.net">259@redmonk.net</a>.
