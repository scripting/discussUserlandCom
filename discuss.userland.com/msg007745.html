And the stagnation you feel is the web browsers developing without asking what the <b>user</b> really wants or needs.<p>

They can implement all the cool standards in the world, but apparently they can't be bothered to do the simple things in a manner that people would like.<p>

If you detect a hint of frustration, it's there. <p>

I want something quick. Unfortunately, that means that the last browsers that feel quick enough are the version 3 ones. (Or NS4 on a linux box, but I'll stick to mac and win right now)<p>

I want something that edits text. Unfortunately, that pretty much rules out the version 3 and 4 browsers.<p>

I wants something that filters cookies. Either let me turn them off completely (why not ie4?) or let me set them on a site by site basis. i.e. userland == ok, doubleclick.net == bad. Ok I'm paranoid. But I like that.<p>

I want a browser that when I type webmail, it looks through the dns tree and comes up with the machine on my network named webmail. (Mozilla fails this, it calls up www.webmail.com)<p>

I want one that deals with font sizes intelligently. Don't hardlink the relative serif and monospace font sizes (msie). That forces a comprimise between legibility of the two types, where it should be possible to make both work properly.  I would like to set a minimum and maximum type size that the browser will display. My eyes fatigue, so when a site insists on tightly set 9 point sans serif (infoworld?), I can't read more than a paragraph without clicking away.<p>

I don't want something that freezes or crashes.
