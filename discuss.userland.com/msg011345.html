I then logged into my Macintosh with my Windows 98 box then logged into my NT box with the Macintosh.  It worked!!  I am controlling a third computer through the connection to the second one.<p>

The Macintosh viewer seems faster and more stable than the viewer for Win32.  I get almost as much responsivness using the Macintosh to control NT that I get directly sitting at the NT box(Over a 10baseT ethernet connection on both machines).<p>

I'm posting this controlling my Mac from my Win98 machine.  I wonder a little about security.  Any thoughts on this?
