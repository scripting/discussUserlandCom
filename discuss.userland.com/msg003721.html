What would this environment look like? WebDAV? XML-RPC handlers? Integration between Frontier and Zope servers? Some sort of portable plug-in API so Frontier can hook up to Apache? Something shipped out-of-the-box by RedHat, the way they do mod_perl and mod_php3?</i><p>

Here's a good place to begin.. <a href="http://www.scripting.com/autoWebDocs/whatisautoweb_119.html">AutoWeb</a>. However, on review, it's not such a good place to begin. AutoWeb was more about site management. It didn't have the glossary. I think that came in in the Clay Basket timeframe.<p>

<b>Anyway..</b><p>

The first goal would be to get macros and the glossary to working in some Linux-based environment. Store the glossary in MySQL or whatever makes sense. Store the hierarchy of pages. You can simulate an object db in a relational database. Think about it.<p>

It would be fun to build the structure in Frontier to make deployment transparent for Frontier people.<p>

<b>Zope</b><p>

Is a good choice for an environment to target. <p>

Others? I'm a newbie. Show me the way.<p>
