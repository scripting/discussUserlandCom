The location (URL) text field would become generic. There'd be a drop-down with at least three choices for the new text field:<p>

Location  (URL)
Resource  (URN)
Directory (Directory Services)<p>

  For URN's, there would be a sub-menu of resolvers for common professional or industry-specific naming/identifier schemes. For example, typing "toxic:50-00-0" (where 50-00-0 is the identifier for Formaldehyde) and choosing the Natl. Lib. of Medicine URN resolver might return the definitive toxicology data for the substance.<p>

  For Directory Services, there'd be a sub-menu of professional or industry-specific Directory Service Providers. For example, typing "Dave Winer" and choosing WIRED's Digerati (hypothetical) directory service might take the user to scripting.com.<p>

Two axioms:
1) Specialization tracks maturation. Bet on it!
2) Location and convenience matter. I'll use the "drop-down and text field" approach over the "find the bookmark->wait for page to load->enter text in page field->wait for results" approach every time.<p>

Gotta run, I think I hear a VC calling :-)<p>

Best,
Robb Beal
