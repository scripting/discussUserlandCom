<B>Three links for free!</B>
<BR>
PC World lets you include *three* links without having to receive permission (though you have to send them an e-mail about it):<p>

"To create up to three links to Content on PC World Online, you do not need to request permission. Simply notify us of your link by sending an e-mail to permissions@pcworld.com with the URL(s) of the PC World Online Content you plan to link to and with the exact URL(s) of the places on your site where we can find the link(s)."<p>

But then again, if you want to use the article headline as the link anchor you have to receive permission.<p>

<B>Linking isn't duplication? Linking isn't duplication!</B>
<BR>
But wait! Civic.com, another IDG publication, has their own interesting linking policy:<p>
