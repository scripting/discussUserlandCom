Prince's site is one of the most paranoid sites I've ever seen. As I was browsing around I conceded OK it's another pov of the Web, then I came across a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/lookAtAllTheBrokenLinksOnPr.gif">page</a> with all kinds of broken images, and there's the lesson, keep it simple, it's hard work to keep a site paranoid. You end up with broken links.<br><br><b>From the Black Hole of Mike Donellan<a name="fromTheBlackHoleOfMikeDonellan">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/08#fromTheBlackHoleOfMikeDonellan" title="Permanent link to 'From the Black Hole of Mike Donellan' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://blackholebrain.editthispage.com/2000/08/08">Mike says</a>: "In the same way that Lars Ulrich shouldn't be blathering on about the way things work on the internet like he does, neither should internet people be blathering on about the way the music business works either. Mindless name-calling between groups who should be supporting each other at this important cross-road is just gonna end up putting the control in the hands of somebody who REALLY doesn't give a shit: the government."<br><br><b>My use of Napster<a name="myUseOfNapster">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/08#myUseOfNapster" title="Permanent link to 'My use of Napster' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	My use of Napster has shifted. After going to a concert, the first since using Napster, I've been exploring Sting music released after The Police split up. Some wonderful stuff, like Fields of Gold. What a beautiful song. I've also been exploring KD Lang. What's different is that the music is stuff that I've not purchased.<br><br>	So yesterday I bought a KD Lang <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=1365697558/pagename=/RP/CDN/FIND/album.html/artistid=LANG*K.D./itemid=408428">album</a> at CDNOW, and today I bought a Sting <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=1593381568/pagename=/RP/CDN/FIND/album.html/ArtistID=STING/DDCN=SD-7502+269+2">album</a>.<br><br><b>From the world of Blogger<a name="fromTheWorldOfBlogger">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/08#fromTheWorldOfBlogger" title="Permanent link to 'From the world of Blogger' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Unlike <a href="http://www.megnut.com/archive.asp?which=2000_08_01_archive.inc#603879">Megnut's Mom</a>, I (heart) <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/06/17/ILoveAcronyms">acronyms</a>. I had to say that the Blogger way.

She's <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19554">seeking help</a> from people who have worked at ISPs, on the record or off. <br><br><b>Thanks!<a name="thanks">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/08#thanks" title="Permanent link to 'Thanks!' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I'd like to thank the people of the press who are working with me, in new ways. I am not a competitor in the sense that I will not call 19 people and get quotes and do all the research that a professional reporter can. I love partnering with reporters. The first time I did it was with Jodi Mardesich, when she was at the SJ Merc. I had a source saying that Gil Amelio had been fired, but it hadn't been announced yet. Jodi and I both got our stories on the Web at the same moment, hers a reportorial, and mine an op-ed. This is the win-win. I'm a participant in the industry, and I write. Sometimes I get leads that I can't do much with. We can work together.<br><br><b>The value of links<a name="theValueOfLinks">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/08#theValueOfLinks" title="Permanent link to 'The value of links' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://inessential.com/2000/08/08.html">Over on Inessential</a>, they're talking about the value of links down the left edge of weblogs.<br><br>	When I spoke with Joel yesterday, he told me that that a link in the left margin of Scripting News is worth a lot to Google. When I linked to him there he became the first hit when you search for Joel on Google. I think Susan Kitchens found the same thing when she became the authority on Lake George, NY, according to Google.<br><br>	Then I remembered that Google rates hits based on how many places point to you, and I guess it must be recursive in some way, because Scripting News is pointed to in so many places, as Doc found out, a link from this site means more than a link from other sites. <br><br>	In that context, I'm glad that Updates is the first link in the left edge, perhaps that acts as a distributor of flow to frequently updated Manila sites. I like that!<br><br>
