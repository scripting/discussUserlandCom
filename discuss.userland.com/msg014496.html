I hate to say this, but this one site, this one man, has completely shaken the news reporting establishment.  I really dislike this guy.  Yet I have to respect what he has done.  His site has had a real effect in the flesh and blood world.<p>

Nomination - The WWW Virtual Library
<a href="http://www.vlib.org/">http://www.vlib.org/</a><p>

From what I can remember, this is the very first 'portal' on the web.  Showed there was worth in linking outward to other sites.  It looked like Yahoo! way before Yahoo! (at least I think so...).  <p>

Nomination - Justin Hall's Links from the Underground

Well, it used to be titled that!  This site was and remains one of the most popular 'diary' sites on the web.  His site now resembles a weblog!  He devulged everything personal on his site.  Kinda like a Howard Stern of the web.  And his links!  I used to go there just for his finds back in 96.  A huge inspiration.  He may have been the first online journalist.<p>

Hmmmm... I think I made a booboo here.  It's titled 'will change the world' not 'have changed the world'.  Hindsight is so much easier!  Oh well....
