name) has a logoff page which is a clone of the page at discussionGroup.logon.logoff. I was seeing this in the browser: 
[Macro error: Can't evaluate the expression because the name "" hasn't
been defined.]<p>

John Simms solved my problem:<p>

"I ran into this when calling mainResponder.members.setCookie. Make sure the adrMembers parameter is supplied, and correct. I logoff users simply by using the macro:<p>

&#123;"<!--" + mainResponder.members.setCookie ("", "",members) + "-->"}<p>

Since the pageTable is within scope, and members is defined, I can just refer to it as such."<p>

John.
