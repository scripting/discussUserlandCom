How about this, when you hit play, you construct a .pls (or whatever the standard playlist is), send it to winamp and it starts playing. If  the user decides to stop or rearrange things, I think you can just send winamp another pls file and it will restart with that new one.. dunno, I can see if I can find some Nullsoft folks to help.  
(Right now I just want to try to get outlineDocument support in mozilla so I can start building a playlist viewer which can get the same feeds...)<p>

Still playing catchup :)
