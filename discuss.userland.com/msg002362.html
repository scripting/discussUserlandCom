personally, i don't care what the back end is. frontier's okay, but the "community publishing" aspects of it need lots more work; webx and caucus are fine, but they're more discussion-oriented; webobjects would be cool, but there's lots more work involved there. whatever. it doesn't matter. what matters are the people. if the people aren't into it, it will fail, no matter how good the software is. the job of the leader is to give people a reason to get online and get talking with each other.<p>

an interesting side-question to this, i think, is "how will a real-life community react to a virtual community"?
