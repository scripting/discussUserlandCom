What would people like to see from MAC scripting?<p>

I know I'd like to see a couple more OSA languages. There are 3 choices I know of for the Mac: Applescript, Usertalk, and MacPerl. Windows, while it's scripting support isn't as "old" as the Mac's has Javascript, VBScript, Usertalk (?), and a slew of other languages - at least that's what I've heard. More then the Macs have, I believe. More choices, more opportunities.<p>

A question for those "in the know" - is Python available for the Mac, as an OSA language?<p>

Any other ideas on how we can improve scripting on the Apple Platform? I know a guy at Apple, maybe I'll send him some snippets from this thread and see what comments he has...<p>

(I hear Dave saying "Yeah, right", but like the saying goes "You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take!") ;-)<p>
