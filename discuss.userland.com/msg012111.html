The layers of RMI that use Reflection (for dynamic proxy creation) are transport independent, as is the security model.<p>

Having said that, it is difficult to see how one might implement RMI's pass by value semantics in SOAP - that, at least, is tied to Java Serialization and might have to be omitted for talking to SOAP servers.
