I put this line in the same category as the standard line our elected representatives use to justify giving themselves fat raises :"If we don't raise our salaries we won't get be able to get qualified people to run for office." Cow manure. I write and play music because I love it, and there are a lot of people out there that feel the same. Not all of us are after a major label deal, and probably less are now that the underworkings of the industry are getting better known.<p>

New music will continue to be written and recorded. Hopefully when the dust has settled from the MP3.com and Napster affairs we'll simply have come to a better system with more equitable distribution of revenues.
