I'm going to take guesses at some of these answers, don't consider them final at this time please.<p>

1. Is "boolean" a distinct data type, or can boolean values be interchanged with integers (e.g. zero=false, non-zero=true)? <p>

Yes, boolean is a distinct data type. Some languages/environments allow for an easy coercion from zero to false and one to true, but if you mean true, send a boolean type with the value true, so your intent can't possibly be misunderstood.

2. What is the legal syntax (and range) for integers? How to deal with leading zeros? Is a leading plus sign allowed? How to deal with whitespace? <p>

An integer is a 32-bit signed number. You can include a plus or minus at the beginning of a string of numeric characters. Leading zeros are collapsed. Whitespace is not permitted. Just numeric characters preceeded by a plus or minus.<p>

3. What is the legal syntax (and range) for floating point values (doubles)? How is the exponent represented? How to deal with whitespace? Can infinity and "not a number" be represented? <p>

This is one that I'm not sure about and want to do some investigation. I don';t believe we support exponent notation in Frontier. There is no representation for infinity or negative infinity or "not a number" at this time, but let's talk about it.

4. What characters are allowed in strings? Non-printable characters? Null characters? Can a "string" be used to hold an arbitrary chunk of binary data? <p>

Here's where I'm going to take a guess. The XML gurus will certainly correct me if I'm wrong. Any characters are allowed in a string except < and &, which are encoded as &amp;lt; and &amp;amp;. A string can be used to encode binary data.

5. Does the "struct" element keep the order of keys. Or in other words, is the struct "foo=1, bar=2" equivalent to "bar=2, foo=1" or not? <p>

The struct element does not preserve the order of the keys. The two structs are equivalent.<p>

6. Can the "fault" struct contain other members than faultCode and faultString? Is there a global list of faultCodes? (so they can be mapped to distinct exceptions for languages like Python and Java)? <p>

Yes, a fault can contain other members, and in general all the structures can. Suggest for now that if you are going to add elements that you post a message here explaining what they are and maybe they'll be useful to others. The fault codes are up to the server. <p>

7. What timezone should be assumed for the dateTime.iso8601 type? UTC? localtime? <p>

localtime.<p>
