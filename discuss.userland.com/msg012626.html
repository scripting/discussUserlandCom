I wanted something short and it had to end in a .com.<p>

To start out, I checked out an old site that checked the NSI whois db against a standard american dictionary (<a href="http://zipper.com/domains.html">zipper.com</a>). It listed all the words in the dictionary that are available as .com's.<p>

When I found a few interesting 3 and 4 letter domains, <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois">I checked NSI</a> to make sure they were actually available. Some of them were, so I was pretty happy. I've had enormous problems with NSI in the past, so I intended on registering the new domains at <a href="http://www.register.com/">register.com</a>. To register there, you first have to search for the domain. I put in my choice, and realized it was taken. Not only that, but it was taken over 2 months beforehand, and registered at register.com.<p>

Ok, so it seemed like register.com might have their own db that combines the NSI one with their own. I started using register.com's whois and after trying hundreds of names I finally found a good one that was available.<p>

By the time I finally found a domain name, I had also heard about <a href="https://joker.com/domain/index.html?lang=EN">Joker.com offering domain registration for only $20 per year</a>. I checked for my domain, and it was indeed still available. I bought it, pointed it at my name servers, and it worked! I noticed when registering the forms were a bit different and I ended up with a new handle, a CORE handle.<p>

Then I went back to NSI and Register.com to check the domain I had just purchased. NSI had (and still shows) "No match", while register.com showed no match for about 3 or 4 days, and now it displays my info that is stored at CORE's servers.<p>

I posted this as a tip to a discussion list and some members mentioned that register.com had not completely covered all the whois servers and could not be counted on for accurate domain availability.<p>

So now, I'm wondering with all the new domain registrars, which whois db is the "master" database? Is there a reliable whois query that ICANN approves of? Is there an easy way to query the CORE databases?<p>

By the way, Dave, I noticed that the <a href="http://whois.userland.com/">Whois.userland.com</a> site suffers from the same shortcomings as the NSI one (do a search for "huh.com", which was registered long ago by someone at register.com). If anyone knows an easy way to pass queries to a different whois db, maybe the userland whois could be that ultimate whois tool I'm looking for.<p>
