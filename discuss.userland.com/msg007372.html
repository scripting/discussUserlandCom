Business decision; well for my 2 cents worth I think if you haven't got deep pockets and lots of real-estate the service business might not be for you. There are usually high OPEX figures as well as initial CAPEX. If you stick to distributing the software that enables the business you've less risk and "a nice little earner" and avoid building a data centre with tens of linux boxes and big lumps of bandwidth.
