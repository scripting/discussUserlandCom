Thanks, Dave!  I get a good connection from work, but at home I'm lukcy to get close to 28.8.  We're too far away for ISDN or DSL, and the cable company wants $30,000 to bring service to our house!<p>

Personally, I believe everyone involved in the internet&mdash;especially web designers&mdash;should be <i>required </i>to, at least once in a while, surf the net at 28.8, with a few-years-old computer (bonus points for alternating between older versions of the MacOS and Windows, extra, extra points for adding Linux to the mix) and a small screen (640x480).  I'll bet even Bill Gates gets stuck with a slow connection now and then.
