Move the consoleData table into the consoleSite table and rename it to #consoleData. Move the contents of the consoleSuite table into consoleSite.#tools...</i><p>

I like this idea very much and I'm going to try it. It should provide a lot of flexibility. One of the things I want to try is putting a self-contained console website table inside of another website table in news.root. This could be interesting in the scenario where I want the console website table on the server with the sysop managing things remotely with a browser only.<p>

Andr&eacute;, thank you for your patience in helping me understand this stuff.
