suspect that weblogs should be distributed via NNTP instead
of HTTP...  In the meantime, here some things to consider
when you design your own newschannel robot:<p>

<ul>
<li>Download the channel files once per hour, or less.
Don't assume that you're the only one polling for files...
(In our case, one robot grabs all the files every ten
minutes -- several megabytes per week, that is.  Doesn't
really scale...)</li><p>

<li>Consider downloading either the RDF <i>or</i> the
ScriptingNews (XML) version, but not both.</li><p>

<li>If you have an HTTP/1.0 client, consider using a HEAD request
first, and only download the body if the <b>Last-Modified</b>
tag has changed.</li><p>

<li>If you have an HTTP/1.1 client, consider using
<b>If-Modified-Since</b>. And if you're grabbing multiple
channels of the same site, consider using a persistent
connection.</li><p>

<li><i>Don't</i> download files that don't exist -- if
you keep getting 404's, stop looking for that file.  You
can at least wait an hour or two (not a second or two like
one certain robot...).  And if you get a 301, update your
channel list.</li><p>

</ul><p>

thanks /F (just another newschannel provider)
