I think the XML folks are on to something with the idea of using an HTTP redirect. Anyone who is running their own server should be able to set up a redirect - it is not difficult. With WebSTAR, you could set up a !RAW file to send the HTTP redirect header.<p>

On your end, it would be easy to check for the redirect code in the HTTP header, and update the URL.<p>

I think this would be better than adding an extension to the file format.
