What would be much better is to already have a set of protocols and some implementations, and then persuade MS and AOL to interoperate with the protocols -- there's a much better chance of that happening! So, rather than sit around in a committee and try to invent the Instant Messaging Protocol equivalent of Ada, sombody should just write a new implementation and make the protocol open.  Then the IETF could adopt a best practice as a standard (like they've done before with SMTP and other protocols that were sweet implementations long before they were standards) and we'll all be much happier.<p>

Programmers, start diggin'!
