I found myself switching into my email package (Claris Emailer), typing a one-word message, spell-checking it, and then putting the correct spelling into the Frontier WP window.<p>

Seems to me there ought to be a better way.<p>

Does anyone know of a package either internal to Frontier or external to it that can spell-check documents? Ideally, I'd double-click an installer and magically have a new item in the WP menu that said "Spell-check", but I'm willing to wire it up by hand if that needs to happen.<p>

For that matter, I'd be willing to write an installer and any glue that needs to be written if there's an external spell-checker that would work well with Frontier.<p>

Any ideas?<p>
