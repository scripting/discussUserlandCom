(The root of "fantastic" is "fantasy".)<p>

Gates is my grandfather. Ranting on about the <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=plutocracy">plutocracy</a>, and forming a confederation to fight them, to overthrow them, to get revenge for all the injustices they've heaped on the Jewish people. He's the leader. I am his (unwilling) deputy.<p>

He goes on and on. My brother, father, mother, and grandmother all lurk. I have been chosen to receive his ranting madness (we all take turns). I never get a word in. His hearing aid is turned off. He stops when I talk, but he never hears a word. I have to yell, talk slowly, repeat each word five times, he still doesn't understand, I give up, and he resumes his lunatic rant at full speed. Everyone else engages in smalltalk, thankful that they don't have to be in the hotseat.<p>

BTW, in this dream, Ballmer is my grandmother. ";->"
