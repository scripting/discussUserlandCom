I didn't find any info on developer.kde.org.<p>

In the old MacFrontier days, I loved the Commercial Developers' Suite, because it could create a (rudimentary) glue for any scriptable app. It's nice that modern RPC systems like XML-RPC and DCOP don't strictly require stubs, but sometimes it would be nice to have them.<p>

(Actually, I realized there are two issues here:<BR>
1. Is there a way for a human to figure out what messages an app accepts?<BR>
2. Is there a way for a program to figure out what messages an app accepts?<BR>
If you have #2, then it's easy to write a script that generates HTML which solves #1.)
