Prepare to have your mind expanded in ways that no drugs can do, and you get an even worse headache (from what I've heard).<p>

I haven't really found any good documentation, as I learned everything by watching over other people's shoulders.<p>

As a good start, fire up a terminal. (I forget where KDE puts it; I ditched KDE for Window Maker.) KDE has something like the Finder called kfm, but I use 'ls' and 'cd' instead.<p>

Some of the commands that I find really useful when figuring things out are:<p>

which: tells you what file will be executed when running a command. try 'which perl'<p>

locate: the Linux answer to Sherlock. 'locate perl' would return so many matches that you'd probably want to use 'locate perl | more'<p>

man: the "manual" for the system. 'man perl' gives a high-level overview of the Perl docs. There should be a "man page" for every command on your system.<p>

I have a feeling that there's a good O'Reilly nutshell book for this, but I can't afford books, so I don't really know.
