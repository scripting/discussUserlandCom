There are definitely more ways to go. And other benefits that we can deliver. <p>

(An example, we'll archive channels every night on a public server so we can track their evolution a few years from now when all this stuff is commonplace. I wish the web had such archives. We'll have them here, maybe starting later today.)<p>

Anyway, I just added a new diagnostic tool that makes it easy to view the XML text for any channel. I needed this to be able to more quickly diagnose the issues with "problem channels". No more flying blind. <p>

Here's an example:<p>

<a href="http://my.userland.com/viewXmlText$588">http://my.userland.com/viewXmlText$588</a><p>

That RSS file had an error. Look for the red *** in the text for the location of the error.<p>

Here's an example of a file that parses correctly:<p>

<a href="http://my.userland.com/viewXmlText$586">http://my.userland.com/viewXmlText$586</a>
