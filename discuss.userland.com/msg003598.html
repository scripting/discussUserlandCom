There's the connection from the cable headend to your home and then there's the conection of the web to the headend.<p>

I'm interested in:<p>

   - can you tell what's coming from where?  We know these folks use extensive caching technology, I'm especially interested in "are they caching just popular web sites, or video/audio as well?"<p>

   - has MP3 changed any of this?<p>

   - have you ever experienced MPEG-1 video - full screen, full motion (30 fps) video through your system?<p>

   - what satnds out as being blisterly fast - versus just faster?<p>

   - is there any 'custom' content your provider provides?<p>

   - is there a 'broadband' portal that comes along with your service?<p>

Thanks!<p>
