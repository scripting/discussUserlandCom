But isn't it a fact, that this view is very idealistic and that
currently a UNIX port of some sort of Frontier executable for UNIX would help to push this?<p>

I think I got your point now, but it leaves me behind with the frustration, that I still can't make
much use of my Frontier work as publishing or groupware tool (unless I have an NT/Mac on a
leased line, which I don't).</i><p>

Just use Perl for CGI and Frontier to build your websites. I doubt that even if Frontier was ported to UNIX, your ISP will install it. For example I don't know any ISP in Montreal that let you use Python. But there is a lot of ISP that let you run Perl.
 
Its easy to embed Perl scripts in the Frontier WSF. So you can get the best of two worlds. And it improve the portability of your work.<p>

IMO, the combo Frontier-Perl is a very good one.<p>
