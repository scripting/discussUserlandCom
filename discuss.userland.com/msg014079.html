One big improvement we could make is to allow one page to display more than one message. I agree. I don't know why I never did this. Our first web-based BBS in 1996 had that feature. <p>

That suggests two levels -- topics, in reverse chronologic order, and a topic listing, listing all the messages in the topic, again in reverse chronologic order.<p>

How does that sound?
