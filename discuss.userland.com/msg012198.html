If I were a VC, I would have the following questions:<p>1) They talk about publishing brains to a website. It sounds as though they have their own format which defines a brain. Do they intend to replace the web with their own style of hypertext?<p>2) Their style of hypertext is somewhat different than that of the web, at least as far as the java applet is concerned. Links are bidirectional, and go from whole-document to whole-document, unlike the web in which outbound links are located in different parts of the document. The Web style is more useful I think, but the Brain gives very fast navigation, if document titles are descriptive enough.<p>3) Tim Berners Lee mentions in his new book that having outbound-only links was a conscious decision. If links are bidirectional, either (a) you have to embed the link in both documents--impossible if you don't control both--or (b) you need a central link database, which impacts scalability of a global system. He decided to give up bidirectionality and perfect consistency, in return for unlimited scalability. thebrain.com probably won't scale in the same way--it seems more like something akin to the early local-only hypertext systems, where all the content is under your control, than something for the global web.<p>But it's a cool navigational aid for a website, and would make a <i>killer</i> desktop. If I were them I'd make a Linux version that integrates with Gnome or KDE...</p></p></p></p>
