Or even make a positive statement about men, like men are more creative than women. Or men are more honest than women. How does that make you feel? What kind of response would you expect? <p>

I do believe that there are differences between genders, but there's no point discussing them here, because we're not ready for it, or I'm not. When I cross a line like this in a DN piece I get lots of mail, people have very strong feelings on these subjects, and I don't care to, at this time, explore them here.<p>
