    I would suggest looking at how Adobe has addressed these issues with the PDF specification as it is much like what you are asking for.  It's still held by Adobe, but the specs are out there for free and even if Adobe drops off the map there are a LOT of other tools for reading, writing and editing PDF files.<p>
