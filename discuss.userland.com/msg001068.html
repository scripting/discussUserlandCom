We're hoping that, by making the source available, someone with low-level Macintosh programming experience will pick up the ball and find a fix. <p>

Please let me know if you plan to work on it.<p>

PS: We licensed it to AOL and Netscape for no money. We think this functionality should be in the Mac OS.
