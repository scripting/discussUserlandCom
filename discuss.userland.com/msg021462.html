If anyone from Inktomi is listening, please fix your bug, it's interfering with our service.

"If UserLand released aggregator.root, the software behind My.UserLand, would you use it to deploy your own aggregator or offer a service to other people to aggregate news channels that My.UserLand doesn't carry?"<br><br>If you're not familiar with My.UserLand, check out the <a href="http://my.userland.com/faq">FAQ page</a>. There's a related <a href="http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$84">thread</a> on the Backend discussion group started by David Detlefsen. <br><br>At 5:30PM there are 45 yes votes. That's enough to justify releasing aggregator.root. Instead of three aggregators, there would be 48. That's a sixteen-fold increase. <br><br><a href="http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$106">OK, we're going</a> to release aggregator.root. I put a few hours in this afternoon on getting it ready for release. I'm going to do it slowly, not only to make sure the install goes smoothly for everyone, but also to let a discussion develop on how we should license it. <br><br>PR: <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2000/sep/18amazon.html">Apple Licenses Amazon 1-Click Patent and Trademark</a>.<br><br>3/9/00: <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-1568486.html">Amazon CEO Calls for Reform of Patent Policy</a>.<br><br><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/tlkbck/comment/22/0,7056,97481-566277,00.html">Matthew Rothenberg of ZDNet</a> tells a story about Apple and crackdowns on legitimate journalism.

I was. <br><br>	In mathematics you prove theorems. If someone proves a theorem that says, for example, that water feels wet when the sun is shining, the next thing a mathematician wants to know is if water feels wet even when the sun <i>isn't</i> shining. <br><br>	This relates to the ongoing open source discussion. If something is true of open source project, perhaps it's also true of commercial projects? In mathematics a higher statement is "necessary and sufficient." It's worth thinking about, imho.<br><br>	Tim O'Reilly: <a href="http://tim.oreillynet.com/stories/storyReader$63">Is it Open Source?</a> "I'm not on the OSI board, which controls the 'official' use of the term open source, but I believe that even the most ardent advocates would say that this is open source."<br><br><b>What is a developer?<a name="whatIsADeveloper">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/18#whatIsADeveloper" title="Permanent link to 'What is a developer?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	There's been a renewed discussion in the Frontier community about what a developer is and isn't. In my mind, it's not a term to be tossed around casually. Some people who say they're developers are more like hobbyists. (Hobbyists are great, a necessary part of a thriving community, and hobbyists can become developers, but there's a difference.)<br><br>	Part of being a developer is commitment. This isn't a wishy-washy concept. If it hurts your stomach to think of what you would lose if you gave up, you have commitment. In the 90s when I was an Apple developer, we would analyze every crumb of data Apple gave us. There's an art to figuring out the path the platform vendor is on. Look at pricing and distribution policies. When there's a statement from the platform vendor, take it seriously. Read everything you can get your hands on. <br><br>	And even when your feelings are hurt, don't let that stand in the way of getting your job done. Now, some people are customers, and that's a whole different ballgame. But we have some developers here too. And they have the scars to prove it. And our gratitude for sticking with it. It's not easy being a developer. I know. I know.<br><br>
