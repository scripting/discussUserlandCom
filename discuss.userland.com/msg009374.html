I will soon be migrating to a new e-mail address. (Probably when I find an adequate e-mail client). I haven't yet decided what it will be.<p>

I'd like to change my e-mail address but retain my member status as well as my "Member since" cachet. I realize that this facility is most likely currently not included in the functionality of prefs.userland.com but it should be.<p>

When you create a <a href="http://www.whatis.com/pgp.htm">PGP</a> key, you associate with it a name and e-mail address. As you  acquire new e-mail addresses (and, I suppose, names), these too can be associated with your key. The e-mail addresses and names stay associated with your key (Thus creating an identity trail). At any time, however, you can designate a particular e-mail/name pair as your default identity.
