In Dan Gillmor's SJ Merc column today he quotes an Excite rep saying that they can't get webmasters to support META tags, so the question is, can webmasters move as a unit? It wouldn't take many to support this feature to make it worthwhile for a search engine company to support it. <p><p><a href="http://www5.mercurycenter.com/columnists/gillmor/docs/dg120698.htm">http://www5.mercurycenter.com/columnists/gillmor/docs/dg120698.htm</a><p><p><a href="http://search.userland.com/default?m=25&s=1&t=and&q=sitechanges.xml">http://search.userland.com/default?m=25&s=1&t=and&q=sitechanges.xml</a><p><p>What do you think?
