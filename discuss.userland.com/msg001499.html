* Clinton looked the American people in the eye and said "I did not do this."  A lie.<p>

* Clinton used his office and his people to lie, stall, and create a larger problem. This could have been over long, long ago.  He chose to keep it going.<p>

* Clinton painted Monica as a liar and "troubled woman."  It took him a long time to apologize for that.<p>

* Moderate Republicans were waiting, no, begging for *any* reason to vote the other way.  At every turn, Clinton refused to just own up to what he had done.  He has calculated that he doesn't have to tell the complete truth because the American people buy the Evil Republican thing and thus he refuses to do it.  He won't admit he lied.  He refuses to extend the hand.<p>

* Clinton has spent the majority of his two terms pissing on Republicans, not working with them, coopting their programs and taking credit for them, etc.  Coming as he does from essentially a one party state, Clinton has never really mastered the art of working with the other party.  Thus he has no friends there.  Dumb.<p>

This isn't a "religious right" issue.  This is a perfect senario for seeing how Clinton the man actually behaves and thinks.  His entire political career can be demonstrated by this year.  Go back and compare to other giant fiasco's in his career and they all map to this.  Deny, lie, deny, delay.  And it works.  <p>

Because people are essentially suckers.
