But in the case of Linux, they didn't need to because there weren't enough users who weren't willing and able to deal with the hassle.<p>

The lack of an easy interface isn't due to the existence of text files, it's due to the lack of <I>vocal</I> and <I>influential</I> users intolerant of poor UI.<p>

Which is to say, there wasn't enough demand for it. If the users are the developers, and the users are content with hand-modifying text files, then the developers aren't going to invest the time (for which they won't be paid) to write software to manage the files.<p>

If they used binary config files, I bet the interface would still be horrible. Probably some commandline utility with a hundred options and flags.
