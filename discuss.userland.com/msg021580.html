I'm sorry I can't help you there.  It was just hearsay, not directly from any of the participants.  It may be incorrect.  However, I did hear from a number of people (not those involved in the proposed RSS 1.0 spec) that they thought at the time that reissuing the RSS 0.91 spec with a userland copyright was a bit tacky.  I can understand why you did it, though, and I don't have a problem with it.  <p>

As to your comment:<p>

<em>
As to how this discussion got started, check it out, I didn't start the thread. I pointed to your P2P
summit from Scripting News, and one of my readers posted a pretty harsh comment here. You got
in the loop, started making statements about me, and I responded.

What about Scripting News, September 19?:<p>

Tim O'Reilly held a P2P "summit" yesterday. <p>

               David Stutz, Gene Kan, Ray Ozzie and Dan Gillmor were
               there. I wish I had been. I could learn a lot from each of
               them. Wouldn't you have wanted to hear what I think about
               P2P? I'm curious. Are you? If there are going to be more
               meetings like this, I want to be there. Ask Tim to explain
               why I'm not invited, and see if you accept the reason.
</em><p>

If that isn't starting the discussion, you and I don't live on the same planet.  And in fact, the comments I responded to were from one of your readers who said "the answer is pretty obvious". <p>

Let's not spend a lot of time rehashing this, Dave.  It's pretty obvious to most people that you've been the one picking fight after fight with me, and then asking in a puzzled way why I'm not wanting to work with you.
