Meanwhile Apple is making news in a struggle with some vocal users. Couldn't they find something more interesting to put on page one? <p>

My response:<p>

Perhaps it's not the most interesting topic in the world, but it is the one that may keep me from buying another Apple product.<p>

Apple disabled the ability to upgrade the G3 chip to a G4 chip in what appeared to be an innocent firmware upgrade; my G3's upgrade potential was crippled AFTER I installed a firmware update that said it was to improve PCI performance. There was nothing in the Apple documentation for the update that said: "By the way, by installing this update you've agreed to limit the life-span or usefulness of your machine."<p>

As a long-time Mac user and buyer, I love my machines and OS (I don't think Wintel users share the same dynamic; it's a Mac thing and I can't explain it) and it hurts when I find I can't trust Apple.<p>

Apple won't explain. So I don't know if I can trust the next "innocent" update.<p>

I'm not a vocal user; I'm a pissed user. Is that the relationship Apple wants to have with me?<p>

</VENTING><p>
