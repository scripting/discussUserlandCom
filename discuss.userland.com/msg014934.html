Wahid can pardon General Wiranto with respect to violations of Indonesian law and can prevent an international criminal court from apprehending the general in Indonesia or enforcing any convictions in absentia.<p>

An international tribunal can take custody of Wiranto anywhere it can catch him, try him either in person or in absentia notwithstanding any pardons granted by Indonesia's president.<p>

Crimes against humanity cannot be pardoned by the government of any one country.  Realistically however, Wiranto will be safe in Indonesia as long as a government there wants to shelter him from an international court.
