In the case of the Scripting News format, it may be the right one.<p>

A couple of comments about using a CDATA section...<p>

1.  Since it isn't parsed, well-formedness+validity can't be checked (without using a "sub-parser" to parse the character data within text).<p>

We wouldn't be able to catch the fact that <i&gt; is missing an end tag in the following:<p>

<text&gt;<[!CDATA[<i&gt;Update! New tag: &amp;lt;profile&amp;gt; added to Scripting News DTD]]&gt;</text&gt;<p>

We also can't restrict tags to a subset of HTML.<p>

2.  It implicitly "says" that markup within the text element isn't really part of the "scripting news format".  Maybe it isn't.<p>

I'm sure that this debate has happened sometime on XML-DEV.  I'll check the archives.<p>

Ulitmately, I guess, it is up to Dave/Userland to decide.  With or without a DTD modification, it still requires a change to the script that generates xScriptingNews.xml.
