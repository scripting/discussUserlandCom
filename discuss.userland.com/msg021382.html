I'll answer your questions, but I'm equally confused, I thought the spec was pretty clear.<p>

1. Radio UserLand is a client. <p>

2. OPML is a tiny subset of XML. The body cannot contain anything. It can contain <outline>s and that's all.<p>

3. expansionState, etc are not viewer-specific. These are outlines, knowing how they are expanded for viewing is something many viewers will need to know.<p>

4. Yes, isBreakPoint is intended to be respected by a scripting language. We needed it for UserTalk scripts, but of course it could be used by Python or tcl as well.
