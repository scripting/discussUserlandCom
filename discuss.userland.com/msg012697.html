ADSI is MS's "next big thing".  It can access the IIS namespace, LDAP, NTDS, NDS, etc.  Kind of a generic way of handling users, groups and access to resources.  I have to say that I've had varying degrees of success with non-MS namespaces, and had the worst time with the documentation.<p>

After much digging, I have successfully created a #security script that uses VBScript to authenticate against an LDAP directory!<p>
