The new header sub-items are great!<p>

I'm not sure about the way the <item> tag works now. Is the <title> tag gone? I'm hoping it isn't, but I don't see it in the 2.0b1 of today's ScriptingNews or the DTD.<p>

The new format does have expressive power due to the <text> and <linetext> tags, and I like that. A lot! And it suits the way Scripting News is written: short paragraphs, often with multiple links embedded.<p>

But it doesn't work as well for a drill-down type of interface, which is what I've been working on recently. If I just pick off the <linetext> tags some of the "headlines" the user sees are just things like "Here's the next revision", "RSS version" and "fat version". A little cryptic. (And should I make "RSS version" and "fat version" two separate top-level items? They're not...)<p>

The user could drill down one level further to read the body text with the embedded links, but it's not quite as useful as a well-written <title> like, say, "ScriptingNews format revised", which would let them know if they should drill down or not.<p>

Of course, having say, a <title> and multiple <linetext> items makes extra work for a site like ScriptingNews since you don't use headlines, and I'm not sure what the <title> would link to on ScriptingNews anyway -- an anchor within the ScriptingNews html page? Or just drill down to read the <text>? Hmmm...<p>

...time to revise my UI...<grumble> :-)
