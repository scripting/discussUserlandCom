He knows intimately what the other side of the gate looks like. Now he's writing about the gate from the other side. <br><br>It's taking time to get used to thinking and communicating outside the firewall. We rely on the comfort of rules imposed by old technology while we learn how to work with the new. It happens in software too. I have to make the browser feel to me like a development environment I'm used to. I have to make procedure calls work over the Internet so I can distribute my applications, using power that's new to me. However I never had to learn how to <i>write</i> outside the firewall, that's the only kind of writing I've done, except for one or two pieces I've written for Steve Gillmor. ";->"<br><br>Perhaps this was the disconnect I had with Hotwired when I used to write for them. They were so set on me doing a weekly column that was turned in 5 days early so they could run it through their process. I hated that. By the time the article ran I'd have already moved on. All of a sudden I'd be getting email on something I was interested in 5 days ago. Oy. I wasn't there anymore. (Is there an echo in here?)<br><br>We also missed a scoop that way. I had Steve Wozniak on the record criticizing Spindler's Apple. At the time this was newsworthy, and my story which had appeared on my personal website days before it appeared on Wired, had been picked up by the Examiner and ran on page 1 of their business section. Our pub was web-only. It should have been on <i>our</i> front page minutes after I had the quote, instead of the days it took to run it through the normal cycle. Don't get me wrong, Hotwired was a fantastic pub for its day. But you can see how weird that all looks now, 6.5 years later.<br><br><a href="http://buzz.weblogs.com/2001/03/29">Deborah Branscum</a>: "I’m a big fan of accuracy and fairness but I’m not convinced that reporters can necessarily capture the truth in 800 words or less."<br><br>I've been getting emails like <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/theKindOfEmailILove.gif">this one</a> all day.
