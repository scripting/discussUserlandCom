The web is not just in the US. The fastest growing parts of the Internet are in countries where the language isn't English or Western European. Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Arabic, Farsi, Russian, Kurdish, Hindi, Urdu, Persian, and many more. Everywhere. Now. <p>

How are these changing the world? These sites are evolving their own communities with their own cultures and standards. Styles and tools. Interests and legacies. In the US, those of European descent are rapidly becoming the largest of minority ethnic groups. The de-USification of the web is happening too.  <p>

If you are in one of these countries, the web of your people is a wide-open opportunity to create a unique online culture, ecommerce services, and to serve the educational needs of your nation.
