My goodness, I click over to Scripting News to go through yesterdays links and there's already stuff for Thursday at 4:00AM PST. That's what I call a passion for what you are doing.</i><p>

I sleep very well thank you. I have a great content management system that I can script, and it has a nice scheduler in it. I've been playing. Pretty soon we'll have hourly updates, 7-by-24. They call it the <i>worldwide</i> web for a reason! ";->"
