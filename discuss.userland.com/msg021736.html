Granted, Powell or McCain would be a much more compelling ticket-mate. But if either of them had been available, interested and acceptable, they would have been the pick in the first place, and we wouldn't be sitting here discussing Cheney. </i><p>

There's also that rather unusual Veep-hunt, where Cheney looked and looked and found <b>himself</b>, a figure from George Sr's term, another oil industry guy, etc. It's not entirely clear why Cheney got the nod for Veep over the other candidates, nevermind Powell and McCain.
