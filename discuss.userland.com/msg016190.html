You can say anything you damn well please. However, state laws and contractual obligations aside, if Conxion doesn't like what you are saying, they have the right to shut you down for any reason they like. Likewise, you have the right to find a new ISP whenever you please. (Whether or not these are good business practices is an entirely different matter.)<p>

But unless there is a federal government entity trying to restrict or influence your writings, the First Amendment has nothing to do with this situation.
