We're working on ad sharing among weblogs using the Weblog Monitor. The idea started at the <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/weblogs/huger.html">Robot Wisdom</a> site, was adopted by a few webloggers, and within hours was running on the Weblog Monitor. Being a total graphic idiot, I had to struggle with Adobe ImageReady to get a <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/ad/dave@userland.com">24-by-175 graphic</a> together for Scripting News. I yearn for the days of Canvas 2.0 when graphics editing was easy.<p>

The <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/stories/storyReader$60">ad sharing server</a> is working. If you refresh this page, you should see a different ad below. Of course if you click on it, you go to the weblog.<p>

To show how flexible this scheme is, I <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/weblogs/603.html?">posted</a> a note to the Weblogs mail list, and included the HTML snippet, and now eGroups is part of the network too! <i>Lovin it.</i><p>
