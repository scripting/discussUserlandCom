Every day I see more articles on the web about women and their use of computers. That's cool, but it seems every article includes one or two sweeping negative statements about men. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/06/07/BU11357.DTL">This article</a> has two, maybe three. Can you spot them? There are so many ways to say this is wrong. The golden rule, two wrongs don't make a right, you reap what you sow. Here's what I have to say. I'm a man and I don't like it. <i>Thanks for listening.</i><p>

<a href="http://www.feedmag.com/column/interface/ci223_master.html">Feed</a>: "With Third Voice, the para-site community has attached itself directly to the host, but in a way that is only visible to Third Voice users. For Web publishers, that's a mixed blessing. On the one hand, your pages can spark discussion and debate, even if you don't have conferencing software installed. On the other hand, outside readers suddenly have the opportunity to scrawl in the margins of your text, whether you invite them in or not."<p>
