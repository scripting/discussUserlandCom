It'll be compatible with Trellix, it will embrace Tcl, and every  other scripting language that's wired up to the scripting standards  on Windows (don't forget Python and Perl and Visual Basic) and it  will totally integrate the web experience into the authoring environment on Windows..."<p>


Okay, I have to notice that the fastest growing scripting language on the web is the only one not mentioned here.<p>

Windows is JavaScript-able. So is Office. So is Dreamweaver. So is ImageReady. So are lots of other apps.<p>

Any hints as to a future relationship between Frontier and JavaScript/JScript/ECMAScript?<p>
