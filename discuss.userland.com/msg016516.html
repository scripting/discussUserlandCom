It seems to be mirrored in the <a href="http://www.kenjin.com">Kenjin </a>search/suggestion engine which was recently launched by <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.02/autonomy.html">Autonomy</a>.

Imagine when replying to a post, that you can see everything the author's previously written on the subject, because the agent guesses it will be relevant...<p>

Autonomy's founder says that he wants his company to become "the Oracle of unstructured data", and this seems to chime with what I was saying about the non-academic desire to build from the ground up rather than beginning with Ideal models of organisation. It's definitely a writer's company. Harness its engine to web-based distribution, and the potential is stunning.
