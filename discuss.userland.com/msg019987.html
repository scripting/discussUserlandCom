Close, but I'd like to nitpick. ;-)<p>

The GPL doesn't tell you what you can do with <i>your</i> software--it tells you what you can do with <i>somebody else's</i> software.<p>

For example, I disagree with several of Stallman's points. I don't think proprietary software is fundamentally wrong, and I have nothing against people who write it.<p>

But I still use the GPL for certain projects.<p>

<b>Why I (Sometimes) Use the GPL</b><p>

When deciding between a completely open license and the GPL, I ask myself a question:<p>

<ul>
<li>Would I feel good if somebody started selling a proprietary version of my application without my permission?</li>
</ul><p>

In most cases, I can answer yes to this question.<p>

For example, I released <a href="http://customdns.sourceforge.net/">CustomDNS</a> under a completely open license. If you want to make a proprietary version of CustomDNS, all you need to do is give me credit in your copyright notices.<p>

But not everyone is quite so laid back. The <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> and <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> developers don't want anyone to create proprietary versions of their desktop environments.<p>

They remember <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19889">what happened</a> to the original BSD developers, and they choose to protect themselves.<p>

<b>User Rights</b><p>

If I give <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19854">certain rights</a> to my users, I choose to call my software open source. <p>

If I don't care what people do with my software, I use the XFree86 license, or something very similar.<p>

If I want to ensure that <i>all</i> of my users get certain rights, I use either the GPL (for applications) or the LGPL (for libraries). In that case, other developers are not welcome to create a proprietary version of my work.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
