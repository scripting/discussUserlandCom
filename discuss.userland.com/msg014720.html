Imagine having a site similar to Macromedia's (most everything is Flash) with all the content powered by Manilla.  <p>

I think the best bet for this type of interaction is to use Generator.  It has SQL and ODBC hooks for content.  I don't think it supports XML-RPC, but it would be cool if it did.<p>
