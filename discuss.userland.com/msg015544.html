A. Investor Confidence. Patents are as close to tangible assets as accountants can measure, so they incent better valuations for VCs and angels. <p>

B. The Friendly Patenter. Natrificial's patent defends the firm from some large entity filing the same patent and tying this category up without building anything at all? <p>

C. Patent Enforcement Funds Today's R&amp;D. Having innovated and shown the way, Natrifical's patent may create a revenue stream for further innovation, support, and marketing.<p>

I believe this. My concerns: 
<ul><li>Do investors really behave this way?
<li>Do patenters bevahve virtuously, and 
<li>Do software and business process patenters collect revenue from patent licenses in a way that promotes use of innovations vs. stifling them? </ul>
