I got 5.1.5 over the weekend and worked with it for the first time tonight.  It seems a little faster 7.6.1 PPC <a href="mailto:604@120">604@120</a>.  It definitely saved faster and backed up faster.<p>

I even was able to get a guest data base going.<p>

Doc request:  Make the defn of [f] in your guestDataBase Doc clearer. The mix of "HD:Fronter:websites.root" in squarebrackets took a while.<p>

Feature Request for future version update:<p>

When you backup the root it assigs sequential numbers.  You can backup a gdb and you get one of those numbers.  Set up something to number each gdb with a separate series of numbers.<p>

I'm just glad to have 5.1.5  with the comments on the e-mail lists; I'm looking forward to upgrading to 8.5.1<p>

I got Frontier to help with my website after reading a review 19 months ago in MACUSER.  It helped more than I expected.  I got a bonus, it has helped automate my website and e-mail tasks.<p>

Thanks<p>
