dynAuthor, WebEdit, discussion groups, console.root, news.root, and ContentServer are all different ways to collaborate on websites.<p>

You may find one that's perfect for your needs, you may find you use two or more, or you may find that you write some of your own workgroup software in Frontier, either extending one or more of these or written from scratch.<p>

If you can describe what you want to do, and what tools will be available to the members of your group, I'm sure people would help you figure out which software is best for you.
