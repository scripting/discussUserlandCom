These are newUser(), deleteUser(), and authenticateUser(). Are these used anywhere? Were they designed to be callbacks, then never used? I can't find hide nor hair anywhere that describes what these may be or their use.<p>

It would be GREAT if these scripts were available. I have a real use for the new- and delete- scripts especially. (I'm assuming that they would be called when a user is added-to or deleted-from the system.)<p>

Hints? Pointers? Dashed hopes?<p>
