Manila is not going to be Windows-only. But there will be features that people will love that *will* be Windows-only, if and only if, Apple fails to act. There is still time. But we won't wait for  Apple. I want that to be very very clear. </I><p>

I think now I get it and I am with you. I just *hope* that we do not depend on Apple to provide what&#180;s needed and I count on Manila to be "backwards compatible" should this really come to pass.<p>

Note that there is already the MSIE HTML renderer in Mac OS 9. It is there as a shared library to display the help pages. Since I am not up to speed with Windows, could you tell me the difference in the approach?<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
