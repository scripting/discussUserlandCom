It's all relative I guess. Coming from Unix, when I first saw Visicalc/Apple II in 1979 it was like having the puzzle put together for me. Earlier this year when Dan Bricklin uploaded the exact same piece of software, I couldn't believe that this is what I went ga-ga over. I had the same experience a few weeks later with ThinkTank for the IBM PC. Windows 1999 is a lot better than the Apple II and early character based PCs. The web, however, as a UI medium, is not as rich.
