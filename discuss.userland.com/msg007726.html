Yes, but that would require every site to provide a java applet for download for their forms. So it would work on certain sites were people visit with everything enabled.<p>

And a java applet would not work out of the box for this site (discuss), since there is not only a textarea in the submit, but also a textbox. I'd need a different applet for my web mail site. (to, subject, body).<p>

This is sounding more and more like the promise of opendoc (not necessarily the implementation, but the promise.)<p>
