This isn't a new law rolled out specifically for Microsoft.  The <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/ch1.html">Sherman Anti-Trust Act</a> has been around since 1890.  <p>

Here is a a quote from section 1 of the law:
<i>Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony</i><p>

Lets expand this "competitive" analogy.  Are the below examples illegal or just a company being competitive? <p>

Is it OK for PacBell to cut off your phone service if you don't buy internet acces from them?
Is it OK for you power company to cut off you electricity if you don't get rid of you gas range?
