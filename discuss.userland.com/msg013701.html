From the get-go, we could put a cascading style sheet on every page, as well as a JavaScript block.  Then, we were given the ability to put multiple days on the home page and specify the formatting for each day's block, and this was followed quickly by being able to specify the navbar formatting, the calendar's appearance, the graphic/link used to shunt people into the discussion forum from each story or graphic, and now, the ability to customize the membership box.<p>

For me, all this has meant that I can throw CSS wrappers (usually DIV tags) around most of the Manila content, dump all of the special formatting put into the tags on the HTML page, and put the formatting into my cascading style sheet -- much easier for me to maintain a uniform look across multiple elements and multiple uses of the same elements.  If you look at the page source on <a href="http://queso.editthispage.com/">my ETP site</a>, you'll see that my membership box has <b>much</b> less HTML than the normal one (which, for me, means much less ability to accidentally apply different looks to similar elements).  (Of course, it also means that it doesn't look perfect on Netscape, but that's another issue.)<p>

And given that my home Manila installation is set to download the updates automatically (no problems yet!), these new parts of the admin prefs forms just appear like magic.<p>

I like this.
