It's an interesting question. Maybe a part of the question is the complexity... as it was said by someone else. In fact, early days of HTML and HTTP were very, very, very simple.  But there was no tools to work with. Tim did a tool, and many people have followed like the developper of Viola and NCSA's Mosaic later.<p>

Dave, you (and your team) have done a wonderful tool that I really appreciate because it's easier to edit webpages in a sense. But I strongly feel that a part of the job SHOULD or MUST be by the developers, and that's not done. Many browsers are not compatible with the specs (It's getting better), we could just take a look at Macintosh IE5 for the StyleSheets components. Userland as a developper of a CMS should provide right templates by default. That's not the case. I know you will say that it's configurable, and I agree with you. But is it the role of the author? <p>

So thanks for your job, but it could be better... :-)<p>

BTW: I've liked your cruxified position in the Auditorium just at the right of Tim Berners Lee. Shame on me, I don't have my arrows at that time.  :-) Next time, I will take it in Honk-Kong.<p>
