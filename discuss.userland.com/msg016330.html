Since they're apparently (according to their own complaints) not making all that much money slaving away for the big recording companies, what do they have to lose?<p>

Another surprise in this negative trend is that some performance started on the Internet and then signed on with the recording studios after becoming known. Go figure. Maybe <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/12/02/digital_music/index.html?CP=SAL">this</a> is the problem? In the meatine, all of this is getting really <a href="http://www.newsbytes.com/pubNews/00/147490.html">uglier</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,35670,00.html">
uglier</a>. According to <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,35122,00.html">this</a> piece, artists are opposed to Napster and the likes. Maybe they're not so badly off with the recording giants after all? Huh?<p>

Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/04/biztech/articles/17neco.html">this</a> clumsy and cumbersome effort seems doomed from the start.<p>
