Today's <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$175">all-new booth crew</a> is Teri, Suzanne and Sami.<p>

Finally a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$174">beautiful sunny day</a> in Davos!<p>

Just got back from a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$154">plenary session</a> with Steve Case, Bill Gates, Sumner Redstone and Michael Dertouzous. Gates said they like to do software at Microsoft. Case said they're happy to let Microsoft do that, they are not in the platform business. Redstone said most of the creativity in the world is within 100 miles of Hollywood (huh?) and Dertouzous said that he looks forward to seeing "content" from the rest of the world. Thank you.<p>

I wanted to ask Case if he plans to do anything interesting with Netscape's browser, but I didn't get a chance.<p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$150">At the media leaders lunch</a>, just before the demonstrations on Saturday, I picked the most interesting table, the members of the Russian press corps attending Davos. <p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$151">On stage Sunday night</a>, Russian political/economic leaders gave hardass answers to questions of free speech and Internet use in Russia. <p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$152">Sheldon Laube</a> is one of the founders of US Web, and someone I see often at parties in Silicon Valley. He has a new startup, CenterBeam, that Manila may play a role in. Also pictured is his wife, Cathy, who is a doctor and photographer.<p>

Here's a picture of <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$153">Steve Case</a> listening to Mr. Son of Softbank, both are waiting to pass thru security to get into the Congress Center. <p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$155">A panel</a> this morning with Tim Koogle, and Scott Cook and Durk Jager of Yahoo, Intuit and Proctor and Gamble.<p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$156">Finally</a>, Steve Case at a press conference where I got to ask my question about the Netscape browser, and heard that they'll continue to build on MSIE because of their bundling arrangement with Microsoft, although that had absolutely nothing to do with the question I asked.
