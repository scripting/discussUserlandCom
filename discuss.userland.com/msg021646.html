A pseudonym used when discussing software is okay when a person talks like a software developer.  Then name and identity don't matter.  But when a person appears to wear a mask that doesn't fit, it gets harder to suspend disbelief enough to keep the story going.<p>

(Suddenly I feel like the mask maker in <i>The Moon Moth</i> who says honor can always be increased by removing nuisances like Marshmen and importunate strangers.)
