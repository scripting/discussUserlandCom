The Installation Guide is thick in order to be thorough. If you need any help feel free to ask. I just downloaded and installed RedHat 6.0 -- have it running on one of those little ultraportable Toshiba 3015's. That's with fairly unstandard/new video and sound chips. I had no problems. (I had no need for docs, but I've done this before.)<p>

If your hardware supports booting from CD-ROM, make the change in the BIOS and reboot with the CD loaded. Otherwise, use the boot floppy.<p>

Know your network configuration info and anything 'custom' about the box. Most of the autoprobing should work fine.<p>

Pick the "server" option, which will handle partitioning the hard drive and installing appropriate software. It's fairly self-explanatory. Follow the prompts. After just a few clicks and a wait for the software install, you'll have a running Linux server, with Apache already installed and running too.<p>

You may need to configure Apache for PHP, and you'll have to make a decision about the database. MySQL is straightforward and there's nice PHP, MySQL, and Python support available.<p>

The Installation Guide is there for detail and for covering the options available for custom installs. The bulk of it is not needed if you are doing either a server or workstation install.<p>
