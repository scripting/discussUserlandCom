I think its time to think about the web a bit differently than print. Its only in the last 20 something years that designers have gained control over the 4-color offset printing proccess. <p>

Even now we have to deal with limitations in print - we work around them. Designers need to look at the web and see the limitations and aviod them while they exploit the benefits.<p>

Just look at if differently, your life may get easier :-)
