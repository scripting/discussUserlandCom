It's about as much work as installing a binary under Win95 or NT.<p>

Unpack<p>

run configure<p>

run make<p>

run make install<p>

Even on my P100 notebook this takes very little time and works very well. My failure ratio is about the same as with binaries on Win95, with the difference that there is no registry rot.<p>

With the automation already built into many packages, using configure scripts and automatically generated makefiles, the next step may well be an 'auto compiling' installation, where the binary is created for you, using the best available libraries on your system, and installed. With no user intereference apart from 'Get to it!'
