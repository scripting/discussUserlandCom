Such a terrible tingh!<p>

We have a different attitude. I could give a shit if anyone like what I do. The people I'm interested in reaching are people with minds who don't need or want me to shuttle their attention around in slavish ways. I love Dan and I love Jakob, but I don't always agree with them, and sometime I think Dan does get breathless over silly things. Shit happens. (I drifted out of the Yiddish persona somewhere in there.)<p>

Hey Dan, how's Mitch doing? Will he be at Esther's? If you see him tell him I said Hey!
