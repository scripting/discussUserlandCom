I have in my members.root a users table containing over 3,000 entries.
Unfortunately, the entries are all of type(string) and I want them to be of type(address).
Now then; When I select all entries and use the little 'Kind' selection box at the bottom of the table to select type(address), only the first entry gets changed.
Am I going to have to change each one by hand?  Methinks not but I have not got to grips with the scripting yet to suss out how to automate the task.
Summary, convert all entries in a table from type of string to type of address.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
TIA
