I think you're wrong here. I think Americans have a pretty good understanding of what exactly "high crimes and misdemeanors" are. And that the appropriate way to punish Clinton is _not_ through impeachment.<p>

If "impeachment" meant actual removal from office, it wouldn't be happening. This impeachment is happening precisely because the House Republicans know the Senate will not remove Clinton from office. It's consequence-free pandering to the religious right.
