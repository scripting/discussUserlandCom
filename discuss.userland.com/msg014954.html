I've just redesigned the <a href="http://redmonk.editthispage.com">Redmonk.Net</a> website. It's an old design in some ways - I worked it out a couple years ago and have been waiting for the right time to spring it on the world ever since.<p>

Well, world, here 'tis. I'm interested in opinions. Gone is the chartreuse background, and the old-world Franklin Gothic "redmonk". I admit to kind of liking the scattered eclecticism of the old design... the new one is sort of Frank-Lloyd-Wright-meets-early-90s-U2.<p>

So- have at it, at please let me know what you think of it.<p>

p.s. - this is a design in flux...
