Why is it, in your mind, that you have written off Mozilla? Esp since it's not even released yet?  And did you know that mozilla will allow you "inlined" to any page to edit it? Meaning you see some page with tables, images, etc. and you simply turn editing "on" and now you can type and change the text, modify the tables, etc. etc.
