I think you could assign a different port to each user, and use port forwarding appropriately. That's what I plan to do on my NAT if I ever have time to try out Pike. <p>

I do that. When I had one ip address and several machines, I was running ports 80, 81, 82, 8000, 8080 and 8888 for different httplike services. (including apache and zope on one testing machine, frontier/pike on another, and a couple of other random web services.)<p>

I must also add that NAT is very useful if the isp that you're using tends to change your ip address a bit more often than would otherwise be expected from a static IP service.<p>

There are several classic ways to get things through firewalls, used by various services.<p>

1) Well known ports.  Petition to let them through with the admin. (http/smtp/quake)<br>
2) Tunnel through otherwise innocous protocols. (real audio over http)<br>
3) Do some freaky stuff and never tell people what port you're using (Aol IM and Yahoo Messenger)<br><p>

I have some good ideas of how to get pike through firewalls and intermittent connections. I've got them mostly implemented but they have some implementation compartmentalization issues that I haven't resolved yet.<p>

ps. I have set up several packet filtering 'firewalls'. They do a good job if you know their limitations. <p>
