Yes.<p>

<i>When you create an array in Javascript do you have to initalize it to it's maximim possible size?</i><p>

No.<p>

<i>Can I call a function in the head of my docuemnt from the body of the docuemnt?</i><p>

Yes, this is normal.<p>

<i>or visa versa</i><p>

I wouldn't recommend it, as it might not have loaded yet. Functions should really go in the <HEAD&gt; section.<p>

<i>Can I create multidimensional array by creating arrays that hold arrays as their objects?</i><p>

Yes.<p>

BTW, this isn't really the best place to be asking JavaScript questions. The "Scripting" in "Scripting News" doesn't refer to JavaScript. Of course, this is Dave's call to make.
