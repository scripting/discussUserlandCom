I was going to add to the
discussion group that the WebTV folks re-format web pages all the time, and wanted to see how they did on your newest site.<p>

From my Mac in the latest WebTV viewer I entered the URL<p>

	<a href="http://www.scriptingnews.com/">http://www.scriptingnews.com/</a><p>

and instead of the redirection to /1999/01/04 like I get from a real
browser I get the index of all of the files, and can browse the file
hierarchy...not that I could probably do anything with
/downloads/websites.sit.hqx in a TV...<p>

Anyway...please note that<p>

	<a href="http://www.scripting.com/">http://www.scripting.com/</a><p>

works like it should...<p>
