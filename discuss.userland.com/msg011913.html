<I>I don't like computers, I like what I can do with them.</I><p>

<B>Just so.</B> I've been telling people this for years. "Oh, Jim likes computers." Nonsense; I detest computers, but my work, unfortunately, depends upon them. <p>

Computers are noisy and fragile. <I>Why?</I><p>

Computers need to be attached by a myriad of different cables. <I>Why?</I> <p>

I'm pretty sure I know why. I'll parrot Doug Englebart: The market isn't very good at innovation.<p>

The closest I've come to a satisfactory computer is my recently acquired G3 PowerBook. It mostly stays out of my way and it is quiet. Unfortunately, when I take it out at meetings, meetings tend to start late because all of the people who are fascinated by <I>computers themselves</I> gather 'round. <I>Ooooh. Ahhh.</I><p>

It is the baroque era of computer hardware. Witness the iMac. Fortunately, IMHO, Apple decided to try to solve some of the cabling issues while "enhancing" the case design. A translucent case is, I guess, a step in the right direction. If Apple wants to do something really revolutionary, they'll make the computer invisible.
