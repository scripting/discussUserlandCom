For instance my site is not syndicated. Others will have news items enabled, will all these setting 'go' with the clone?</i><p>

Themes are about appearance -- syndication prefs are not part of a theme. The News Items template is part of a theme, but whether or not News Items are enabled is not.<p>

<i>And are you saying we can have a button on our site that says 'clone me' ?</i><p>

The server manager controls what themes are available on the server. Any site that's cloneable will have a download URL for its theme -- a server manager can then download the theme and install it on the server. Installing it on the server is a simple matter of putting the theme file in the right folder.
