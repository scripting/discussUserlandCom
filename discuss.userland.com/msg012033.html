Sorry to "break" it to you, but I've got two things I hope I can help you with to get the Wired channel up and running.<p>

I'm parsing the xml file and keep getting an "Invalid xml declaration" error.  Vignette is leaving a timestamp on the xml file before the xml declaration, which makes it malformed xml, and unparsable, at least with the MSXML Parser.<p>

That, and you are missing the </rdf:RDF&gt; end tag.<p>

Hope this helps and nice work on the rest of your implementation.<p>
