Here's the error message:<p>

Can't evaluate the expression because the name "url" hasn't been defined.<p>

The URL I'm trying to register is:<p>

<a href="http://web.webwerks.co.nz/xml/scriptingnews2.xml">http://web.webwerks.co.nz/xml/scriptingnews2.xml</a><p>

I've had a real close look at it, and I seem to have url tags in all the right places. The XML is generated from a vanila Manila script. The version is the same as Scripting News is using (2.0b1).<p>

Does anyone have idea what the problem is?<p>

Many thanks, Andrew Duncan
