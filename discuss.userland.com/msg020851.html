I'm not sure how many commetns it takes for them to understand this but quite a few users of the format don't seem to want or need the new additions to RSS.</i></blockquote><p>

It's not the quantity of comments that count.<p>

It takes 1) constructive discussion and proposals, and 2) general consensus.<p>

I've done an informal tally (of rss-dev, syndication, backend.userland.com/discuss, SN DG, xml-dev, Rael's pre rss-dev list, FoRK, xmlhack.com, and xml.com) and, by far, the majority of people posting comments are in favor of the RDF+NS approach.<p>

There has also been concrete discussion about how the RDF+NS approach solves the problems people had been seeing in the widespread use, and abuse, of RSS 0.91.<p>

The only alternate approach has only been stated as a desire to "work together", with no concrete suggestions.  The proponents of simply "working together" have also never made any concrete suggestions as to how people who want to extend RSS, but in ways that aren't suitable for inclusion in an RSS spec directly, can do so in a manner that won't walk all over anybody elses extensions, now or in the future.<p>

There are also some that are simply against RDF or XML Namespaces in any way, shape, or form.  They have not provided concrete examples of their perceived difficulties.  Those working <i>with</i> XML Namespaces and (to a degree less than I'm satisfied with) RDF in RSS have shown exactly what the difference is in usage, to which none of the anti-RDF/NS people have commented on (to my recollection).<p>

There's been a lot of senseless FUD flinging.  To mangle a cliche: It's time to put your code where your mouth is.
