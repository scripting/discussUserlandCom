My poor brain got very confused!!<p>

I thought it was weird that they clearly said what the dates were for 2001 and 2002, but didn't include 2000.<p>

I'm looking for a smallish graphic of a brain, not of a diseased or sliced up brain, just a happy healthy brain that I can turn into an icon about this size:<p>

"curly"<p>

I want to add it to my vocabulary!<p>

Oy, the net is filled with doctors slicing them up. I want a happy brain. Any help would be appreciated.<p>

(I tried Disney, thinking they might have a kids encyclopedia, but no luck.)
