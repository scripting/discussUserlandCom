I felt it intuitively for years, and then when I saw how selfish he is, how he could drag the US thru the dirt with his lies, I could see how dangerous he is. But all that aside, I don't think there's anything premeditated about him. He's just as shallow as he seems. The real trouble will come from our *reaction* to him. No, I don't think this is WW3. I have hope. I think this Chinese connection will cause us to stop the bombing. Maybe people in the US will start being scared, and stop worrying so much about the morality of ethnic cleansing (we've turned our heads many times before). But the next American president, the flip to Clinton's flop, might be the kind of person who would rally Americans to restore our pride, and that's someone to worry about, really. I think Clinton is a combination of Carter and Nixon. Weak internationally, with no moral backbone. What a combo!
