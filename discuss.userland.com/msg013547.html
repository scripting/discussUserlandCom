I did, however, mean to make heavy comments about Netscape as a company -- I think that their handling of the 5.0 development has been great in its ideals but poor in its implementation, and that when things happen like what Zeldman describes, then it's hard to <b>not</b> feel that web developers are definitely getting the short end of the stick from Netscape.<p>

And I don't want to pick nits here, but I think that Andrew's parting shot about wanting to see the IE installer for Linux begged a response like this.  I do understand your position, though, Dave; I will keep all further comments on the Netscape CSS issue out of Discuss, then, because I don't want to use your personal forum for my vehement beliefs on this.
