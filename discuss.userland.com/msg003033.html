I'm running Frontier 6 in our small network from a Mac. Everything works fine, logon, e-mail replies, cookies, etc., but there's still this problem with "Umlauten" (see title): The message wich is finally displayed shows things like [cedilla] for a &uuml; and similar things. It looks exactly like a Windows formated German text without translation to the Mac charset. <p>

I remember that we had this one already, but a search for "Umlaut" finds nothing.<p>

Now, we'd like to build a CM and editorial system for small companies' and broadcast stations' web sites, and we are in Germany, so we have to get rid of this problem.<p>

Are there any hints? Am I missing something? Where exactly is the parsing of a posted message done inside Frontier? (I hope it's not kernelized....)<p>

Thanks for any input, and I must add: Apart from these problems, Frontier 6 is simply mindblowing.
