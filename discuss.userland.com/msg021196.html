I watched that Bill Moyer piece on KPBS (San Diego), last night. I thought about the messages that show provided frequently today. Both of my parents are dead and it's amazing how often I think of them and miss them.<p>

Dave Winer's comment about self-recognition seems to be right on the money. We are only here for a short time and then we leave for another journey. Considering the odds each of us overcomes at the moment of conception, all other experiences that follow pale in comparison.<p>
