Great links as usual. It's definitely time to roll around to iSyndicate. They were in the Release 1.0 special issue on this stuff. I had also heard that Vignette invested, in order to get their story flow to go thru ICE. Reviewing the roster of speakers at Internet Content 99, I was disappointed to see that none of iSyndicate's competitors are there. This is what passes for a conference these days. If it's a developer's conference for a single vendor, why not be upfront about that?
