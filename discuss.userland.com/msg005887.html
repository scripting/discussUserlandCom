Core Foundation Overview <p>

Ali Ozer <p>

Core Foundation is a new Carbon library which provides consistent and
powerful C APIs for strings, collections, user preferences, property
lists, plug-ins, application and shared library packages, and XML
handling. These APIs are designed with portability, performance, and
consistency in mind, and are available for Carbon applications on both
MacOS 8 and MacOS X. We will give an overview of the APIs and go into
depth on some important topics.
