I can tell you countless stories about this, misunderstandings and wasted effort because person A meant one thing but person B heard something different.<p>

On the other hand, the next step after saying what you heard is to hear how the other person responds. Too often there's a huge long argument about what the person really means. That's bullshit, and a waste of time, and usually ends in frustration, for both people.<p>

You make another good point about public opinion not being monolithic. I'd like to see the numbers broken down. I favored impeachment. I guess that puts me in the same class as Jerry Fallwell. Oh man, that doesn't feel very good. And anyone who supports Clinton is also supporting someone who tried to sell out the Internet with the Communication Decency Act in 1996. I find it especially ironic that feminist leaders are supporting a man who bombs foreign capitals and lied to cover up sexual harassment. <p>

As Jerry said, what a long strange trip it's been!
