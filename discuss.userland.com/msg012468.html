But this is very different. Your words go out the way you want them to.<p>

What if you didn't reply to everyone who disagreed with you? Are you afraid that a significant number of people who believe that signified your admittance of error? Can't you give them the last word, even if you think it's the wrong word? Why is that?<p>

What if you didn't even read everything? You might still choose to read 80%, but you'd ignore the people who tend to be a thorn in your side. I'd guess there's a relatively small ongoing group there. You could make your own kill file. You wouldn't necessary hide those comments, but you'd put a flag next to them, and decide whether you wanted to deal with it. When looking at the thread hierarchy, you could choose not to read any of that thread if a significant number of messages were red-flagged.<p>

Of course, you would build this so that all readers had that feature available. You'd probably want to build it so that from an individual message the reader could say "this is a stupid message, set a yellow flag for this person", or "this is so stupid set a red flag for this writer (for me)".<p>

This starts to slide toward the epinions web-of-trust.
