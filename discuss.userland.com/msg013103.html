I have a DAT tape backup drive that's gone down on me.  I think it failed because the drive under it, in my drive stack, had a fan failure.  Therefor exposing the tape drive to high heat.  When I use it, it just keeps searching and searching trying to get to a spot on tape.  When I look inside its gullet, I can see a rubber/plastic guide that looks melted.  I'm thinking that it just can't position the tape properly.<p>

I'm wondering if anyone can recommend a company that does good work on these types of devices.<p>

Thanks for any info.<p>

I'm desperate to backup my Frontier! :-)  Heh.
