A possible solution would be, during rendering, to convert the message to an XML tree first, and then render the XML tree just as you would render any XML.  This would give you a lot of control over how different tags get rendered.  In the case of something like <category&gt;, rendering to HTML would remove it or put it in a comment, rendering to XML would leave it alone or transform it if the destination XML needs it somewhere else.
