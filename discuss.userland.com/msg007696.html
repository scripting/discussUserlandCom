Most clearly, to me, is the stagnation of the web browser market.<ul><p>

<li>I don't think Microsoft ever does software for love. I don't think they love the web. What a bad situation for the web. Because so many people use the web and because there's no real sign of life at Netscape either. Marc Andreessen is givin a lot of speeches. <i>But where's the software?</i><p>

<li>Look at how ridiculous the situation is. Who would ever use two programs, one to read and one to write? Why isn't the web browser a writing environment *and* a reading environment? Because none of the engineers on MSIE at Microsoft use Hotmail for email. I can only infer that, because if they did, it would be <b>usable</b> as a writing environment, even in a rudimentary way.<p>

<li>Another reason to keep the text editor in the web browser crippled -- to protect sales of Office, which includes Word. They do a hack to "integrate" Word with the web. But MSIE is already very nicely integrated with the web. It just needs a decent text editor. You know what would happen? People would toss Word out the window. Who wants a WP that struggles to understand the web? MSIE *is* the web. The difference is not subtle.<p>

<li>We shouldn't, as an industry, let them take over the web this way. To close the loop another way, who are we to complain about Microsoft's loveless software? Have we come up with any alternatives? Have we been able to organize in our own interest? No, in fact, the people doing the complaining in Washington are the ones who could have done the most, if their intentions were good, if they had courage, if there was love in their software. But they're loveless too.
</ul><p>

Nope, consumers like to be lead, and they don't mind be lead by people with fear in their hearts.</li></li></li></li>
