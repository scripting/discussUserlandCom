It would be cool if frontier could provide some order to chaos say via a way to request other's share lists, other's collected hosts (sorta gnutellaish), and perhaps do a ping via xml-rpc.<p>

Here's another cool thing, just like napster's hotlist, also use xml-rpc to request a user's "recommendations" meaning you see that they have file XYZ, you ask their server for recommended music that is "like" the music listed.<p>

I could even imagine a search engine built on top of this...
