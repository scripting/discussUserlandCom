i realise it's quite a while ago now- but do you remember if anyone responded to that question? what are people doing with their new toy? i'd be interested to know if their big fast pipes enabled a better sense of community, or whether they're just having speed thrills. as an outsider, i can't get in to the "personal pages" area of <a href="http://www.maine.rr.com/">http://www.maine.rr.com/</a> - it's difficult to tell how successful it is in actually accomplishing the goals you repeated in that article.<p>

i'm remembering the demo of "fiberlink" that i got when i was looking around at where to buy. they emphasised the community aspects of the system, and what wonderful things could happen. granted, they were a bit sketchy on the details, but after a big hyped launch, nothing has happened.<p>

is anyone from maine reading this? what's happening in broadband world?
