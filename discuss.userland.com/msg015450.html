Something else - I have an idea for an ETP site. But I dont want to do it alone. It would be nice if there was a way to solicit help  or form a group sort of before the site is created.<p>

In terms of webapps helping - yes, where do we start ?
I could create stories to review, or point to good resources, or pretty much anything related to this.
