You have a Credits page, listing lots of names. You have a DaveNet Reader Profiles story. You have (a few) big names at <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1011">Quotes from Press and Users</a>.<p>

What about some one-or-two-liners from Ordinary Users, or even Ordinary Developers? Distill some of the comments at Thea's site!<p>

It probably seems obvious from your side, but seeing this written down: <i>After buying a licence, I can updgrade easily with one button</i> might say a whole lot more to a whole lot of people.<p>

Just a thought!
