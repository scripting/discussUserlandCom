More great news! <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$773">XML.COM</a> is now producing a fat XMLization, just like Tomalak and Scripting News. This is very good news indeed. The more support we get the more likely Netscape and others will let the content drive the process, not technology and industry politics.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7483">I'm looking for volunteers</a> to write scripts in Tcl, Python, Perl, AppleScript, etc to turn straight text into a channel file for My.UserLand.Com. If there are volunteers I'll kick it off by releasing the source for a Frontier script that produces our XMLization.<p>

OK, we got volunteers for Java, Python, Perl and Cold Fusion. So in keeping with my offer, <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7516">here's the source code</a> for the script that produces a My.UserLand.Com channel that runs in Frontier 6.<p>

<a href="http://www.basilsoft.com/AppleScript/textToXmlScript.as">Steve Zellers posts</a> an AppleScript version of textToXml. <i>Thanks!!</i><p>

<a href="http://px.sklar.com/code.html?code_id=154">Adam Trachtenberg posts</a> a PHP version. <i>Coool!</i><p>

<a href="http://www.freedomforum.org/technology/1999/6/17katz.asp">Jon Katz on flaming</a>. "On the Net and the Web, openly expressed ideas are on the beginning of a discussion, not the end. A tech or not, the writer has to accept the fact that some, if not most, of his ideas will turn out to be incomplete, illogical, even wrong. This is the very different reality of the interactive writer: the willingness not only to receive criticism, but also to accept and study it."<p>
