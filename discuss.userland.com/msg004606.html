This is from the read me:
<i>
May 28, 1995<p>

WELCOME TO THE PERL 5 OSA PRERELEASE<p>

This is a practically untested "proof of concept"-only release of the Perl OSA Component.
</i><p>

Maybe there is something more recent (I recall a Perl 4 one that was solid...)?.... (followup) umm, well I just searched through the mac-perl archives and came across these quotes concerning the above mentioned OSA compontent:<p>

<i>
The limitations of the MacOS version of the OSA Perl plugin have little to do
with lack of support from Apple (except that I ran into some obscure corners of
the code fragment manager which seemed to be undocumented). I just lost
interest in the current OSA component when it became evident what sort of
memory consumption and startup time it had.</i><p>

and this snipit:<p>

Would it make since to use Frontier's approach in making a MacPerl OSA
component? You would have the component available whenever MacPerl was
running and you could get it out of the way when it wasn't needed.<p>

response:<p>

Problem is that MacPerl is not suitable to run multiple interpreters.
