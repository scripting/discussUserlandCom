My browser already has a feature which allows me to do this on a per link basis.  I use it explicitly when that is what I want to do.  If you target links to a new window by default, then you deny me the choice.  The choice is very nice to have depending on the browser that I happen to be using and the level of brain damagedness of its history mechanism.
