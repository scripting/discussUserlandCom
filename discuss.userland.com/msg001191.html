My only complaint has been that TCL isn't installed on any of their web servers... not a very big complaint.<p>

While I'd love to use them for DSL service they have a 500 megabit a month transfer limit. I do that much in two weeks. A static IP is part of the basic DSL service from NWN... alas, the quota prevents me from using them.<p>

But despite my relationship with US West once you're running with them... you're running. USwest.net provides minimal email and web services but still provides them at quick speeds.<p>

One bonus to using DHCP and bridging, you can get as many IP addresses as you like and they can't tell the difference. You can connect a hub to your DSL and each machine can acquire a separate address. The only problem is that these machines are then unable to communicate with one another (there is some issue with them occupying the same place in a class C network... i think).
