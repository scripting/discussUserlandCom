Let's say you are someone with ideas to communicate.  You set up a web site, post your views, and perhaps start to build a community of like-minded individuals.<p>

What is your role?  Are you an observer, a journalist, a lobbyist, an organizer, or a leader?  The oft-used net term of "advocate" has the potential to span several of these, but some combinations (like journalist-leader) seem a bit difficult to balance ... at least to our modern sensibilities.<p>

I've heard comparisons between this age and the "man with a printing press" era of the American revolution.  It will be interesting to see how this evolves, and whether web sites will adopt more traditional journalistic rules (seperate pages for reporting and opinion, etc.), or if some new form of subjective journalism will become the norm.<p>
