oh, I've got a good idea what ru is and isn't.  I've been watching from afar, and use it occasionally. I just haven't had time to do anything with it yet.<p>

and, no, i'm not going to complain about the outliner later ;-).  Looks good to me, and it's fun to do some ui work in Frontier again. (I miss macbird)<p>

Also, I gotta say that by now I'm used to you.  Whatever you call it, it's still Frontier...<p>
