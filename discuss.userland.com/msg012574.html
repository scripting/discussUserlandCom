I've been to Epinions a few times now and been a bit underwhelmed with what I've seen.  Sure, the idea is a neat one, and the site's democratic aims are laudable, but there's a problem: I don't agree with the concensus on who's a good reviewer and who's not.<p>

I've noticed a similar problem reading Slashdot: I don't always agree with the moderators' scoring, even if it's much better than no scoring at all.<p>

I want reputation management to be in my hands, not in the hands of the masses.  I can do this when reading Usenet with Lars Ingebrigtsen's <a href="http://www.gnus.org/">Gnus</a> - I score up the people and topics I want to read, and I score down people and topics I can't suffer.  Why can't I do this on Slashdot, Epinions, Scripting News, or any of the web boards?<p>

The web has got to be able to handle diversity of opinion, not just democracy.
