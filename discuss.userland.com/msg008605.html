Sideways?  Vertical scrolling I understand.<p>

I may be a minority of one (I don't think so though) in absolutely hating sites that make me scroll horizontally to read a line.<p>

There are some sites that manage to make their tables just wider than my window <i>even if I resize the window</i>. I'm not sure how they do it, but it's a royal PITA.<p>
