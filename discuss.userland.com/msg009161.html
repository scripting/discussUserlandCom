It's all as if there is some kind of Cambrian explosion of different kinds of animals - each with strengths.  I think AOL and MS messenger are sort of like fish swarming in an increasingly crowded pond.  Someday when some fish starts crawling on land, they will immediately begin to dominate the landscape. I think this "crawling" is the open support of the developing IMPP protocol.  All it takes is some no name startup to be the first to announce full support for everyone else to blink and start supporting it as well.<p>

What's really odd to me is that there are NO web-based instant messengers!  Surely someone could create a server that talks IMPP and allows folks to simply go to a web page which periodically pings the server again for any messages since it's last request.  It would not be unlike the web-based IRC or other chat programs.  <p>

DAVE, perhaps you could see if there is anyone interested in an Frontier project with this.   And what if you combined IMPP with XML-RPC?  You could perhaps get a crude Technography device?
