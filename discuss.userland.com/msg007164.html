*Thank you* for putting Neal's text here.  (And thank you to Walter for announcing it here)  I wouldn't have found the energy to download it if you hadn't.<p>

Nor did I find the energy to leave this page -- until I had read the whole damn thing.<p>

Now I know what a Snow Crash is!  (I've got his book, maybe I'll read it now?)<p>

Ironically, Neal Stephenson was on a local (Vancouver) TV show on Monday... it was the first time I had ever seen or heard him, though I had heard OF him.<p>

He looked like a programmer.  He talked like a programmer!  Ah-hah!  He IS a programmer!  (Phew, the world makes sense again)<p>

PS: I have a Euro-car, station wagon, M-1 and a Batmobile running in one room!
