I call it the "bucket brigade" approach.<p>

There is a new extension to DW that allows it to read and write to any file and read directories and create directories.<p>

So what? You say- well what this means is that DW could "watch" a directory or file like Frontier does, and when a new or updated file enters that directory, DW could read it in, parse the XML and using some scripting call the functions spec'd by the RPC call.<p>

I call this a bucket brigade approach because you pass the message like a bucket - 
send an email to say a netscape browser - it auto-downloads it every few minutes and using a filter, saves the email to a specific folder.
Then, DW which has been set to check this file every few minutes , detects this change and reads in the file. It parses the XML and runs the functions specified the the rpc.<p>


The only chink in this armor is that I cannot yet see how to get DW to  upload or download files to/from a server.<p>

I'll post more about this as I discover it...
