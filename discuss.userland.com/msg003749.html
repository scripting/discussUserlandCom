You go away to a 24 hour dinner party and a discussion occurs. I appreciate the relatively even handed discussion on the issue of Linux and Frontier. I certainly see more of your side than I did before all of this happened.<p>

I'd like to bring in a bit of background. I'm not a prototypical frontier developer. I am a hobbyist who put together a cool hack and it has grown to have a life of it's own. I like programming in usertalk and other high level scripting languages far more than I do low level code like C.  In fact, it's been a long while since I did anything in C more complicated than make clean; make install.<p>

Frontier isn't currently driving my choice of systems. For my personal development, it is sufficient to have it on personal OSs. (Mac/NT) What is driving my choice of OS is applications for my day job (I design bridges), and they are mainly structural engineering programs that only run in Windows.  Unfortunately, when I need to reduce a lot of data quickly and do results visualization, the tools are far more availiable for linux. I can do the work in NT, but it's not as productive as it would otherwise be.<p>

My ideal os would probably be along the lines of MacOS X server. A solid well thought out gui and the core of a unix box. Unfortunately, the two systems that have these particular specs are either too expensive for a desktop (OSXServer ($1k)) or don't run the software I need (Beos and OSXServer). Then again, it's been over 10 years since WIMP made its debut. It's high time for the anti-mac.<p>
