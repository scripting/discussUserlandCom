Discuss the issues here without designing the survey. Leave that up to Eric and me. We'll do our best to ask a meaningful question without making it so complex that people get confused.</i><p>

OK, Dave. I'm going to post some draft ideas to get people talking. This is totally provisional, so please make suggestions of your own. I'll post new drafts as needed.<p>

<b>Some Choices</b><p>

These choices are still a little bit complex. How could we simplify them? <p>

<ul>
<li>I've never released any software.</li>
<li>I've released software, but not as <a href="msg019977.html#footnote">open source</a>.</li>
<li>I've released <a href="msg019977.html#footnote">open source</a> software. However, I have nothing against proprietary software.</li>
<li>I've released <a href="msg019977.html#footnote">open source</a> software. In addition, I'm ideologically opposed to all proprietary software.</li>
</ul><p>

Yes, the last two choices <i>do</i> include a second question, one about politics. Dave, do you care about making this distinction?<p>

If not, we can fold the last two choices into one.<p>

<a name="footnote"><b>What Do We Mean By "Open Source"?</b></a><p>

We're using the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">standard definition</a>. If you've ever released software in the public domain, or under the X, BSD, GPL, LGPL, MPL, or <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">similar license</a>, then you should answer yes.<p>

If you <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html">prefer</a> the term "free software" to "open source", please say yes anyway. And if you prefer to use a third term, that's OK, too.<p>

One important caveat: If you own patents on your software, please answer no.<p>

(If you've agreed--in writing--to some sort of <a href="http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/mutual-def.html">mutual defense system</a>, then your patents are OK, because you can only use them against people who sued you first.)<p>

<b>Discussion</b><p>

OK, Dave. This is just a draft. I want you tear it apart and make your own suggestions.<p>

I'll listen to what everybody says, and write another draft.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
