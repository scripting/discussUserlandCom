Having taken a brief look at the new features list and the free demo, I feel its very disappointing.
Homesite on the PC set the standard for HTML editors 18 months ago and Barebones have failed to even keep up with its depth and extendability.
I used to use BBEdit with Frontier 5.0 and it would have been great to see this product really take a step forward. <p>

Incidently I was wondering why isn't the glue for BBedit isn't incorporated in Manilla ?<p>
