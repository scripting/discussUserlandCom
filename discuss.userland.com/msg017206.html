BTW, we do both forms of XMLing. We have a huge library of static XML files representing the syndicated story flow for My.UserLand. It's really grown quite large, and scales well, and is useful.<p>

OTOH, we believe we must use XML-RPC for preferences distribution, to connect with the search engine and to link editors with the CMS. Polling won't work, imho, in those apps. Same with the scriptable spell-checker, when someone breaks through there, it will be an RPC app, it can't be built on static files.<p>

Initially we programmed My.UserLand to be much more dependent on XML-RPC but found that approach too complicated. But the whole RSS network, which is also growing huge, is based on static XML files (or virtual static ones).
