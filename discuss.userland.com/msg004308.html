I think what Chuck and I are saying, that you probably don't agree with, is that, as investors, we must consider factors, that you seem to not find significant.<p>

My comments are not idle because some of my users are reading this stuff. I want them to know if they go to Mac OS X, not to expect much support from Apple or UserLand. It's important that they know this.<p>

Time will tell, you're never too old to learn something new. You may be right that Steve Jobs and Apple are smart, too smart to let a bunch of developers' investments get flushed down the toilet. Or there are other possibilities. We'll see.<p>
