<P>
Libraries do not require their patrons to forfeit the fruits of their own labor. The GPL is analogous to saying that if you learn something from a library book and use that information to make money, you must give all of that money to the library.
<P>
The GPL is an attempt to turn the "library" of freely available code, which is a good thing if it is <i>ethically</i> licensed, into a nasty and unethical weapon against commercial programmers and their livelihoods.
<P>
<i>, and the GPL won't kill software or programming as a profession.</i>
<P>
Its explicit intent is to hurt the profession to the point where programmers cannot make a good wage. Stallman says so explicitly in <i>The GNU Manifesto</i> (which see).
<P>
<i>The sky is not falling.</i>
<P>
If someone injures, rapes, or kills someone else, the sky will not fall, but it is still a terrible thing.
<P>
