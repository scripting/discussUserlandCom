That said, I was able to prototype how I'd separate editing and viewing. Also, I used hover mouseovering instead of underlining of hyperlinks. The readability of underlined links suffers too much for my tastes. Last, I added spacing between the weblog names to further improve readability.<p>

Start here and toggle between view/edit using the hyperlinks:<p>

What I learned:<p>

If you want to make a page extremely compelling, lots more things needs to be objectified, so CSS styles can be applied at a fine level. A big win would come from giving identity to each hours group of web logs, then you could a) have a stack like UI element where a mouse-click brings up the element behind it in place or b) have a horizontal timeline where a hyperlink causes a horizontal scroll to a specific hour. In the latter case, you'd probably want to fix the number of logs in any given hour and then provide a 'more' link if that number was exceeded.<p>

Best.
