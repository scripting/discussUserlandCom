Will being coloured and curvy *stop* you from buying a machine? I don't think so, but if it helps induce others to buy a Mac then that's got to be good for the platform. I wouldn't have made them look the way they do myself, but it doesn't seem to have hurt iMac sales so what do I know? <p>

Amen to that.  Apple didn't sell 800,000 iMacs alone, doubling their market share in under 5 months, stirring up the whole industry and probably lots of others too, because people don't care about style.<p>

Some people don't... but LOTS of people do, and it shows.<p>

I like grape and tangerine... ooh, decisions decisions!  It's like being at my favourite ice cream parlour.  (Mmm.... ice cream...)  Which do I pick?<p>

I think that's the point -- agonizing over colour is a LOT more FUN and less stressful than agonizing over whether to buy a Dell or a Compaq because one has a Riva video card and the other has a Matrox.<p>

Imagine how scary those kinds of decisions are for non-techie consumers who are scared they're throwing their money away for something they don't understand.  People understand Cooooool.<p>

Jobs said something like:  People want to trust us to put whatever's best for them in the box, and to express themselves...<p>

As much as I know I want a new G3 tower, those damn iMacs are so cool I'd hate to pass it by ;-)  Grape or Bondi Blue???  AAHHHHHHHH!<p>

It's fun to be a Mac user in the market for a new 'puter in '99.
