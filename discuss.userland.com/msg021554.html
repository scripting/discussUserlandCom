from The Way of Chuang Tzu, by Thomas Merton: <p><p>

The Empty Boat <p>
 <p><p>

If a man is crossing a river <p>
And an empty boat collides with his own skiff <p>
Even though he be a bad-tempered man <p>
He will not become very angry. <p>
But if he sees a man in the boat, <p>
He will shout at him to steer clear. <p>
If the shout is not heard, he will shout again, <p>
And yet again, and begin cursing. <p>
And all because there is somebody in the boat. <p>
Yet if the boat were empty, <p>
He would not be shouting, and not be angry. <p><p>

If you can empty your own boat <p>
Crossing the river of the world, <p>
No one will oppose you, <p>
No one will seek to harm you. <p>
