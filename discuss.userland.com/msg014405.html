This site comes from the heart, it's very beautiful. We also know the site is a little slow, we're going to do some optimizing (or "optimising" as Lance says). This shows what you can do with a Manila if you pull out all the stops and if you have great writing and photography to present.<p>

Sidebar to Microsoft, whose <a href="http://www.davosnewbies.com/pictures/viewer$56">CEO</a> will be at Davos, Lance's site runs on a single $2K <a href="http://www.davosnewbies.com/pictures/viewer$46">Dell</a> box running Windows 2000, along with over 1600 other sites. To people who say that W2K isn't a great server OS, let's show them what <i><a href="http://linuxnewbies.editthispage.com/faq">people</a></i> can do, without a degree in rocket science. <p>

Sidebar to Frontier users, Garret is working on a site that explains how the makeover of DavosNewbies happened. From that site, we're going to release a snapshot of the site source code, so everyone who has Frontier can peek behind the scenes and see how he did it.<p>

The optimizing is done on "DavosNewbies", now it should load very quickly. All the little GIFs and JPEGs are being served by Apache now. Here's the <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$95">script</a> Brent wrote to do the optimizing.<p>

The Avantgo version of Scripting News is updating once again. And for people who have been having trouble getting through to the new Exodus server, this gives you a way to tap into the flow thru Conxion. Still looking for hosting nirvana, one that's fast for everyone.<p>

Postscript to my post IE 5.5 woes. Apparently, when I uninstalled IE 5.5, it reverted to IE4. IE4. IE4. Yahh. So I upgraded to the current IE5. And now things are working *much* better! <i>Stay toooned!</i><p>

<a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/newsphotos/vax.html">This old VAX</a> at UW-Madison retired at the end of 1999. I never programmed this machine, it was arriving as I was leaving. I did program on PDP-11s, and loved them almost as much as my 19-year-old girlfriend. (I was 21.)<p>

<a href="http://bradpettit.editthispage.com/2000/01/10">Brad Pettit</a>: "Browsing the binary for the iTools plug-in, it's obviously capable of gathering and sending all sorts of machine-specific data to Apple, such as hardware ethernet addresses!"<p>

TechWeb: <a href="http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB20000111S0009">Joy sees many Webs</a>. "It has been clear to us since '95 that there wasn't just one Web," Joy said. "Many people still think there is just one Web. There isn't. There are six Webs, and they come from the modality in which the information is used. They are all interconnected."<p>

Red Herring: <a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/2000/0112/inv-aol.html?id=userland">AOL/Time Warner marriage causes M&A shakeup</a>. "The AOL/Time Warner merger suddenly gives the Internet world new power. The experts certainly seem surprised at the reversal of roles, in which the new Internet generation, with its lack of large numbers but sky-high stock valuations, can make the rules."<p>

On the Robot Wisdom weblog, <a href="http://greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=002IUT">Jorn Barger asks</a> if AOL has legs. Jorn uses Phil Greenspun's discussion group software, which allows people to post without having registered. A cross between a guestbook and a discussion group. Neil Bornstein gets the first comment and it's a good one. Time Warner has a wealth of creative content. AOL could play music while you surf. Familiar music, golden oldies. I'd love to see a list of music that AOL/Time Warner <a href="http://www.cjr.org/owners/time-warner.asp#music">owns</a>.<p>

How long before they drop the "Time Warner" part?<p>

Last night we had dinner with <a href="http://drmatt.userland.com/">Matt Neuburg</a>. It was fun! I had only met Matt face to face once before, and had forgotten how he talks. We had a great time. We took Matt on a tour of the Frontier source code, showed him how Frontier's compiler, interpreter, object database and outliner work.<p>
