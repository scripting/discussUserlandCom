Warning, this program will eat arbitrary amounts of computer and human time.<p>

I first used this program on a 486/33 megahertz... I don't even want to imagine how quickly a near-gigahertz machine will render fractals that used to take me hours.  Fractint's my informal machine benchmark... I used to watch a machine render the Madelbrot set at 1024x768 to get a feel for how quickly the machine worked.  I had to raise the bar when my 233 had the thing rendered before the monitor was done switching from standard text mode to the hi-res mode.<p>

Version 20's out now, and there haven't been any shananigans with the versioning, either.  It's an old program, and very good.
