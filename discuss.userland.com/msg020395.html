And I have read some really stooooopid stuff.  Here is the summary:<p>

<ul>
<li>software developers are expensive
<li>if the government actively backs the idea that programmers have no right to the intellectual property they produce, the shortage will go away.
</ul>
<P>
The article has lots of input from failed software companies that have decided to become services companies instead.  Wladawsky-Berger of IBM is even quoted in the article, saying something like, "we can't make any money from software so we have to sell services -- we believe that this is the only way to deal with such complex issues in a free market.  Please pass a law!!"
<P>
Next interesting point:  did you know that the word "service" in Microsoft's "software as a service", and "service" in the sense of services that VA Linux, Sun, and IBM hope to sell are the <i>same</i> thing?!?  No, I didn't either.  Trust a NYT reporter to miss a live-or-die distinction like that.  Fucking daft.
<P>
The times notes: "Developers typically join open-source projects or the challenge of solving interesting software problems and the resulting recognition of their peers"
<P>
<I>Are we really that cheap??</I>
