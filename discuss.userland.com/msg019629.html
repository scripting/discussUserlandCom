I've got the same problem that was described and solved at
<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/discuss/msgReader$3699">http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/discuss/msgReader$3699</a>.   But
before I go thrashing about the siteTree I want to make sure this is the
thing to do.<p>

I've recently created a series of manila sites with shared membership
and would like to enable gems for all sites.  The gems get posted
properly (in a www:gems:sitename) so the config seems okay for the gem
upload but the url (<a href="http://hostname/gems/sitename/a_gem">http://hostname/gems/sitename/a_gem</a>) doesn't work:<p>


Sorry! There was an error: Can't process the request because there is no
object named "dodge".<p>

The error was detected by Frontier 6.2.1 in mainResponder.respond.
Webmaster: <a href="mailto:david.detlefsen@bms.com">david.detlefsen@bms.com</a>. Time: Thu, 10 Aug 2000 14:59:04 GMT.<p>

This error suggests to me that mainresponder is looking in a gdb instead
of the filesystem.  Do I need to dork around with the siteTree to fix
this?  If so, shouldn't this be done when I create a site and enable
gems from the control panel?<p>
