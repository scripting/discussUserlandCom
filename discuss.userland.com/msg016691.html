The goal for this project is to replace Manila's Editors Only menu (which is flat) with a menu bar that has depth. This will allow us to add more features to Manila without overwhelming the editor with commands at the top of the screen. We want to make the menus emulate what desktop users have become accustomed to. We asked the browser vendors (MS and NS) to support this directly in the browser. Only got a response from Brad Pettit, who said to do it in DHTML. OK, we're trying. Anyway, since we're going to share the code on this, I asked Jake to open the project so everyone could see what we're doing and perhaps help. Please be kind, Jake is the newest member of our team.

Gillmor paraphrasing Ballmer. "Simply put, we -- the technology users of the world -- need Microsoft, because it takes a company of this size and talent and direction to solve some kinds of problems and invent some kinds of products." Hmmm. I was just thinking the opposite. Microsoft gets concerned that Marc Andreessen is going to eat their lunch. They charge into Web browsers, pretty much ignoring the developers. They win.

Look at how it flows. We work around the brain-dead browsers; Joel, a former Microsoft employee says that we have to design for users who don't care (true); Dan Gillmor quotes Steve Ballmer pleading for his right to dominate us; Gordon Eubanks says it doesn't matter because the Web isn't in their blood; Zeldman and Rauscher, true web developers, ground us in the reality of our day (open source people are equally clueless, and you can't buy a decent net connection).<br><br>	It's all a matter of point of view.
