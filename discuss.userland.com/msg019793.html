<blockquote>
the Nautilus architecture is in place to totally remove the necessity of a conventional filesystem for users who don't want to manipulate it. We won't drive that to the interface for 1.0, but post-1.0 almost all the underlying stuff is in place and will be tied in.<p>
                
Medusa, which was developed at Eazel and will be part of GNOME 1.4 is a disk cataloger and search tool similar to slocate - except that it indexes far more than just filename. It takes about 30 minutes to scan a normal to large disk, and of course isn't going to be doing this while you're working :-) The index files are pretty small (10 megs or so) and of course optional if you don't want this feature. 
<p>
So what does this all mean? This means that arbitrary, complex searches take a couple seconds to run. Medusa is *also* interfaced in through our virtual filesystem. So, the term I like to use for it is remarkably similar to what you quote... Medusa *is* a multi-key semantically queried virtual filessytem. And yes, post-1.0 this will be tied into virtual folders that are actually "searches" that will live update as you change the disk, etc etc. And it will be *fast*. That's only one example of all the things Nautilus architecture is letting us do...

Once we get rid of the filesystem as it now stands, then we can give our full attention to the files themselves, as <b>content</b>.
