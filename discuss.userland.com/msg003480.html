I don't think hat DHTML necessarily needs broadband. I thought that DHTML was designed in part to provide, with lightweight HTML and JavaScript, what formerly could only be done with a Java applet or a plug-in.<p>

Of course, if you're pushing images and video through the interface, then that requires broadband.
</ul><p>

I think that we're confusing terms here. DHTML is just text; it doesn't require broadband at all. It's the <b>graphics</b> (images, video, etc.) that require broadband.<p>

And a cable modem note: we've got one here in southern California, and it's spoiled us rotten. It's a full time fast connection for $40/month.<p>

We're looking at moving to northern California, and bandwidth is a major factor in where we're going to decide to move. No matter how much we love an area or a house, if it doesn't have at least xDSL capability, we won't move there.
