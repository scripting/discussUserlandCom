We will be spending part of our time on core Python development (including Jython and Mailman) and part of our time on Python infrastructure improvements that also benefit Zope."<br><br>I'm heading out for Miami, and will be busy having fun this weekend, so don't expect too many updates. In the meantime, the following link from <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/zopeNewbies/">ZopeNewbies</a> caught my attention.<br><br>Arsdigita: <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/books/building-community/">Building an Online Community</a>. "As far as we can tell, there are only two open-source pre-integrate toolkits for building Web applications: ArsDigita Community System (ACS) -- our own baby, [and] Zope. Zope is an honest reliable effort built by good programmers to a vastly higher standard of engineering quality than any of the closed-source commercial application servers."<br><br>In response I have a couple of comments. First, we ship a lot of source at UserLand, so closed-source is an unfairly perjorative term, it hurts to see those kinds of divisions continue to be promoted. And while I have respect for Zope and genuinely like the people who work on it, I think "Frontier" is quite a bit further ahead in this area. And I don't think ArsDigita's or Zope's engineering quality is any higher than ours. Also, we help Zope. I think Greenspun is out of step with what's going on. We're trying to get the warfare to stop. These kinds of sweeping generalizations, not based on any research, as far as I can tell, don't help. Thanks for listening.<br><br>Now it's time to go to Miami.<br><br></a>
