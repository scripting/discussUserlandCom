That there'd be applications to run this stuff seems implicit.  You're right that there's nothing inherently safe or unsafe about a protocol (it's just bits on a wire like anything else), it's the typical usage of the protocols and the applications that use it that matter.<p>

But just saying "don't use it if <i>you</i> don't like it" isn't a good, broad solution.  My local gas/electric utility's customer service centers were shut down by the ILOVEYOU worm, it could have been worse.  Broad, effective security solutions are important to <i>everybody</i>.
