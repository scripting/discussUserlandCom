Yahoo doesn't use their users' email addresses as the user IDs. So, even if someone gets my email address in the future, since he doesn't know my user ID, he cannot login as me. But Frontier uses the user's email address as the user ID, and to get the password, one only need to ask Frontier to send the password to the email address, so that guy will be able to access my account. And, even worse, pretend to be me to post in your DG.
