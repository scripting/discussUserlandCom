You can add sub-tables to that table, or outlines, or binary information, whatever you like. <p>

If your script is running as a sub-task of user.scheduler.overnight or user.scheduler.hourly or user.scheduler.everyMinute, you can add information to a special table called "subTaskInfo".<p>

For example, in mainResponder.background.everyMinute, this line tells the reader how many guest databases were saved:<p>

subtaskinfo.ctDatabasesSaved = ctSaves
