I guess I would fall into that category as well.  Given two comporable systems, I would buy the one that looked nicer.  At any rate, my employeer has said "no serious executive would put a shiny blue G3 on his desk.  Though one sits on my desk, I must admit that a set of folks will not buy a G3 because of color.  Well, now those types have an option.  And what a good looking computer it is!<p>

So, I do think varying the color is a major deal.  It will move more desktops because they look great and, perhaps, won't scare away those scared of blue.  And that helps my Apple stock!
