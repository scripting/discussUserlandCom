The <a href="http://www.cddb.com/FAQs.html/faqset=dev/page=all">developer FAQ</a> is an eye-opener though; among other things, developers have to submit their apps to CDDB for some sort of validation before they can be released. It also looks like they only provide libraries to developers instead of a protocol spec.<p>
