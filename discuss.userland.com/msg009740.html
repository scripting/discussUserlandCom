Your points are very well-taken, and in fact there's a subculture within the computer security culture that deals almost exclusively with issues surrounding allowing interaction among mututally untrustworthy parties.<p>

The general concept is known as "capability-based security," where a "capability" is essentially an object reference coupled with strong digital signatures and crypto technology--but that's an oversimplification; see the following references for details.<p>

Some truly fascinating Java-based language-and-runtime support for the ideas can be found at <<a href="http://www.erights.org">http://www.erights.org</a>>.<p>

An OS-level implementation of the ideas can be found at <<a href="http://www.eros-os.org">http://www.eros-os.org</a>>.<p>

A college course "Future of Computing" final exam that asks pertinent questions that can be answered with the ideas (among others) can be found at <<a href="http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/finalexam.html">http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/finalexam.html</a>>.<p>

I think we need to quit waving our hands every time the issue of "trust on the net" comes up and start taking advantage of the fact that there's a large body of research and development, particularly from the strong crypto community, that we can bring to bear on the subject.<p>
