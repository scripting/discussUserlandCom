Get in line, Andrew. I've been wanting this since 1997. I was writing Frontier CGI's as my day job, writing a JavaScript book at night, and continuously wishing that there was a tool as good for JavaScript as what I had for CGI's (and that was just with Frontier 4.2). While the popularity of JavaScript has skyrocketed, the tools are still nearly non-existent.<p>

Maybe someday that line that we're both in will be long enough that it'll actually happen? I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
