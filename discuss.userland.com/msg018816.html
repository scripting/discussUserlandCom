The Web itself is one big shiny example.  Then there's thousands of research projects doing new stuff all the time and sharing their software in a collaborative manner, not unlike scientists sharing the results of their works in journals and such.<p>

The only difference between new stuff happening in the open source world and new stuff happening in the commercial world is that there usually isn't a PR event to announce it to the world.  Maybe there should be.
