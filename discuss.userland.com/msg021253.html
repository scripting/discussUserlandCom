I don't edit after a certain amount of time, but I do allow myself to make changes for at least a couple of hours after posting a message. I also participate in communities (mail lists) where there's no way to take back or change a word. The convention there among reasonable people (not everyone of course) is that you should give extreme benefit of the doubt for all such postings. It's also why mail lists flame out more easily than discussion groups. </i><p>

Hmmm. There's a nugget in here I can't quite dig all the way out, but it has something to do with the notion of a progressive cosmos being dependent upon intelligence guiding its change of state in a persistent fashion. Discussion groups exhibit state change in a more persistent fashion than mail lists do. In the larger, more general case, the conflict between intellectually-guided persistent state change and the lack of it is described quite well in <a href="http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=59MIIUWHJS&mscssid=G6P7RDKJ6BTR8JTR8B3TRW2XLUP60ETA&isbn=0140196013">The Alphabet Versus the Goddess</a>.
