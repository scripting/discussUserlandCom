If someone repeatedly told people publicly that they didn't believe I could succeed with my upcoming strategy, I wouldn't send anyone their way either.<p>

<b><i>Of course if Apple changes their colors and shows some interest in our software, that could change, but don't hold your breath.</i></b><p>

Maybe Apple would show interest in your software if you hadn't publicly stated you weren't going to invest in OS X (you said it again in the message I'm replying to).  If they're supposed to believe anything you say, then you've already announced your departure from the platform.<p>

So why should they have any interest in your software now?<p>

<b><i>Microsoft isn't going to do this kind of transition with Windows.</i></b><p>

Microsoft already did it, in 1995.  Win16 to Win32 migration.<p>

Be thankful you didn't go to Windows back in '93-'94.  It killed a lot of companies.  It was a lot more painful than OS to OS X will be.<p>

Apple's offering an easier path than Microsoft offered Win16 programmers when Win95 came out.  For Win16 developers, it was a total rewrite, or being stuck with a crappy Win32s app that had no future (and Win32s was no freebee either).<p>

For Carbon, it's changing 2-15% of your app.<p>

Run the Carbon Dater on the Frontier source, find out what you're up against.  If you don't want to... fine, but don't expect Apple to care.<p>
