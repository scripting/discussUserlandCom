Suddenly, you can be a Web site yourself -- a publisher -- creating content on your own computer, using software tools that are both powerful and easy to use to create sophisticated content, and dishing it out to anyone you want. You can be found, in theory, because people know how to find you using the search engine technology built into the central servers where you register."<br><br>	Dan it's actually even neater than that. You have a URL for your site that routes through a server that's logically one-level-up from you. If you're online, it connects to your server to get the latest content. If not, it's served from the cache on the one-level-up server. <br><br>	This idea is in the air, it first came up for me eight months ago in a conversation with Alex Cohen who was at Kleiner-Perkins at the time. No doubt other technologists are thinking along these lines now. We're actively developing in this model. And before that we had been planning to do this kind of thing for years. (That's why we made the investment in workstation writing tools, that process is well-documented in DaveNet and on Scripting News.)<br><br>	Now, to Doc, what if someone patented the idea eight months ago, and is issued the patent three years from now? This is the minefield I was talking about. I refuse to patent for ethical reasons. See how developers can get burned for playing fairly in idea-space?<br><br><b>Today's song<a name="todaysSong">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/06#todaysSong" title="Permanent link to 'Today's song' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	KD Lang: <a href="http://home.macau.ctm.net/~tina71/lyrics/i10.htm">Constant Craving</a>.<br><br>	Lang <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$889">played</a> at Shoreline last night.<br><br>
