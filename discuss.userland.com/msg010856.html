I understand where you’re coming from. The OCLC, which maintains DDC, views their customers as being professional librarians, and the materials available are geared towards them. This is a recognized problems, and there are projects underway to make the materials more accessible.<p>

That said, it’s my personal opinion that this problem is more apparent than real. I am not a "library scientist" by any stretch of the imagination, but I was happily cataloguing away with the abridged version of the schedules within an hour. *Any* systematic classification scheme is going to have to have rules that are followed.<p>

"LOC & DDS work great, but only when the sorters are intelligent (in this limited definition of the term :-) ). I think the systems will crash and burn when the general public has to do it."<p>

If you mean that the general public will make more classification errors than professional librarians, I’d certainly agree, but I don’t think that’s the issue. The only issue is whether the "general public" will do a better job *with* the DDC guidelines than without them, and to that I strongly feel the answer is yes. Your "crash and burn" metaphor suggests that somehow misuse of the DDC will produce disastrously incorrect classifications, and I just don’t think that’s the case.<p>

"...libraries may move a lot of material, but it tends towards the static..." I’m sorry, I don’t understand what frequency of updating has to do with subject classification. For a hundred years librarians have been *required* to come up with a classification for every document that has been thrown at them, and have succeeded. I don’t understand why the answer to "What is this document about?" has a different answer if the document  has a lifetime of ten minutes rather than five hundred years.<p>

"This would produce some sort of computer classification system (probably expressed as "degree of relationship" to some expert-human chosen baselines (large numbers of them)"<p>

Let me make sure I understand you here. The criterion for the success of this program will be how closely we manage to re-create the existing Dewey decimal system?<p>

"... a more human classification system would need to be projected, but that's mostly sweat-of-the-brow work, not an insoluble problem."<p>

Have you actually used any of the "automatic classification" systems out there? In my experience the results are uniformly discouraging, to put it mildly. The problem is AI-complete: when we have  true artificial intelligence, then we will be able to teach machines to use Dewey, but not before.<p>

In any event, I really don’t understand why one would want to embark on this vast project of bottoms-up, empirical, synthetic research, only to end up with what we already have today: an eminently usable "human classification system", as you put it - i.e., the DDC.
