But... I'm not really sure. It depends on what you call a decent texte editor. If a decent text editor is someyhing that respect the W3C Recomendation, so I will agree with you.<p>

	The most important at that time on the web, is a maximum respect of W3C recomendation. The Netscape decision for DOM is a milestone. It will be easier for everybody to write code, to use browsers, and to surf the net with good tools and well written documents.
