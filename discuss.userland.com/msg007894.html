 1) Write a filewriter filter for the mailserver. </i><p>

Well this is done, and it seems to work with the content server. A day of testing and I'll unleash this on the unsuspecting world. When it's verified, I'll put it through the mailserver root update process.<p>

As an aside, this (frontier stuff) is <i>really</i> cool technology to play with.<p>

Incoming mail when sent through this filter is saved in a specified folder, optionally with a unique name and the attachments split out. <p>

Security is still an issue if attachments are written, so they are turned off till explicitly turned on. This could be addressed with a username/password pair in the body of the incoming email, along with the names of the files included in the incoming email.<p>
