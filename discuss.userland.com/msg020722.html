(Borrowing from Talking Heads:) Same as it ever was.  The amount of rhetoric never abates, ever.  There has always been a struggle to control the agenda of how folks perceive value.  Waiting won't help.  The context will just change so other issues boil up instead.<p>

We should all wear two hats, and switch between them as needed.  One of them should let you talk about software without any bullshit.  The other you put on whenever strangers ride into town, shooting up the place on the way to the saloon.
