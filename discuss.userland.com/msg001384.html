So... if you and I don't have the facts, does this mean you're calling for Mr. Clinton's resignation on the basis of your personal speculation?<p>

Let alone, if he resigns, doesn't that short circuit the Constitutional process?<p>

One of my long standing mottoes is, "Everything is provisional, pending better data."  But data, in this instance, isn't just the facts of the case.<p>

If this was a normal criminal proceeding, with a semi-random jury about to be sworn in, I'd agree -- there's no way to tell how that jury will vote.<p>

But the Senate isn't such a jury.  It's a collection of very well-known individuals, some of whose voting records go back to before either you or I were born.  To imply, as you are, that somehow those 100 people are now completely disinterested and objective -- heck, what are you, an economist? :)<p>

I submit that party affiliation and voting patterns are at least as relevant data in this case as what might be called the black-letter facts.<p>

===<p>

Keep in mind, Dave, if I read your writings correctly, I believe at least as strongly as you that we can do better than the current group of officials.  I agree that we may be on the cusp of a great change.  The Wall Street Journal had an article in the last two days or so that mentioned one of the core rules of politics -- don't alienate your base.  <p>

What it *didn't* mention is that the base that most officials rely on today are the two-thirds of the people who *don't* vote -- and this whole process may finally get them back to the polls.  It's hard to say.<p>

But even if that does happen -- it'll take a while.  Years.  It's a very American trait to say that, because something *can* be a certain way, it *should* be, *rightnowthisinstantdamnit*.<p>

In the meantime, those of us who try to deal with the world as it is, as the foundation to making it as it should be...  Will keep on digging. :)<p>

I think we agree to how it should be.  We just disagree how close we are.<p>
