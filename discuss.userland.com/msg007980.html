This is not good. <p>

Dave, I certainly understand your frustration; this is 'your baby' and 
it moves fast. It is very much a crucible for your and other people's ideas.<p>

However, you've got to expect feedback, and not all of it can be glowing. In this instance, SN was set up as an online community; one which is made up of in all probability at least thousands of users. Changing how they access it is going to upset them. Yes, you posted a listing of changes, but I'm sure I'm not the first person to say that some of the interface is difficult to get around.<p>

I'm frankly surprised at your statement that you want these services to stay professional; I find your tone of the entire venture, as expressed by your writing style, to be very casual. The use of 'party-pooper' is probably indicative. This isn't a bad thing.<p>

People come to ScriptingNews because it's one of the magnets on the Internet at this time for some exciting things. Great. I think you need to think about the deliniation between what people depend on you for, and the 'cutting-edge' stuff. You're the mayor of a town; if you tear up main, street, people WILL complain. You can't get much more professional than that.<p>

Of course, it *is* 1am here, and I *am* freezing my butt off, so I could just be hallucinating. Worse things have happened. <p>

I'm really excited about what I read on SN every day. I couldn't go to sleep because I was thinking about syndication formats (wife rolls eyes). I hope this doesn't mean that the fun has died.
