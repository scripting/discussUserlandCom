Ah, I see where you're at. I was thinking more about the way that "explorer" changed once IE was "integrated", that sort of thing.  The User Experience changed without (imho) any user benefit. I can deal with, though, your example of the help engine changing it's data file format and display engine. I guess I'll have to ponder what the differences are to me a little more [grin].<p>

As for replacable, I've been in the software support business for almost eight years now and can certianly understand apprehension on the developers & supporters part.  But it seems like we've already got a worse mess with other components - how many different apps drop their own copy of mfc42.dll on the system without checking for a newer version?  So somewhere in the system control panel or somesuch there's a field that shows the currently installed version of html_renderer.dll (or whatever) that can easily be checked.  Perhaps the os even keeps a backup copy and can swap whatever's there with it's own in case a problem is suspected.   <p>

I know, I'm being optimistic.  Why should MS, or any company, do a little extra work that would allow customers to use another company's product in conjuncion with their own?  <p>

More thought obviously needed.  But not during the weekend :)
