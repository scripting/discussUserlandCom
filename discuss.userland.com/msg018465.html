I've been developing distributed apps for 12 years, and I can't think of a single time when I needed to move code over to another machine to run. If I had, I would have done it, it's trivial to do.<p>

What I didn't like about his <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/andyHertzfeldOnXmlRpcSoap.gif">response</a> was that it was more of the arrogance of General Magic. I never knew how much of it came from Andy and how much from others. They were the most arrogant company I had ever seen, to their detriment. Considering that Eazel is a relatively unknown startup without a clear business model (ie they're probably still searching for one, esp after the correction), I would have liked to seen him more open to working with others. SOAP is the perfect oppty to do that. Tim had sent him an email asking him to talk about these things in his speech next week. Looking at their schedule I didn't see anything else about SOAP or XML-RPC. Tis a shame because they are both important ways to bridge across OSes and communities. I was glad to hear that Tim wanted them talked-about in Monterey.<p>

On a personal level, when he's not part of some self-perceived behemoth, Andy is a very sweet guy. I hung out with him and Woz one afternoon a couple of years ago. And he reads my site, and I totally like that. Honestly, I was expecting a different response, something like "Hey it would be great to make our software work with yours."<p>

Whatever. We'll learn more about their big picture next week, and then we may be in a position to suggest to them how their work might fit into our plans (a bit of reverse arrogance, just for fun).<p>

Anyway, if you want my opinion.. That and $3 will pay your toll on the GG Bridge.
