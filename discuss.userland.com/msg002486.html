The two issues to address on the client machine are 1) what languages or VMs are going to be standard on <i>every</i> possible client, and 2) what security mechanisms are those languages going to provide to handle arbitrary, untrusted code from a device, the Net, or other Jini hosts.<p>

Unless I'm mistaken, the only available class of VMs attempting to address those issues is the Java VM.<p>

(* Once the device is booted, all you see outside the device is just Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI).  RMI is an RPC mechanism; even though it was developed for Java it's still just a protocol and can be emulated by other languages.)
