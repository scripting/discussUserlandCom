FWIW, the Y2K stories that have made my <a href="http://www.best.com/~davep/davespicks/">weblog</a> are gathered at <a href="http://www.best.com/~davep/davespicks/archive/bytopic/y2k.html">http://www.best.com/~davep/davespicks/archive/bytopic/y2k.html</a> (except for those from September and October 1999, which I still haven't sorted by topic).<p>

If you're truly obsessive about Y2K, <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.html">WorldNet Daily</a> has some Y2K coverage every day. Look for the text "PANIC IN THE YEAR ZERO". They'll also sell you supplies (natch).<p>
