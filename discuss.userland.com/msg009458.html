After releasing the antique <a href="http://www.outliners.com/more30.html">outliners</a> last week, I thought it would be interesting to release a contemporary of those outliners, Frontier 1.0. In addition to being a system scripting environment, Frontier is also an outliner, with a programming language, toolset, verbset and storage system built around it.<p>

I have a shrink-wrap copy of Frontier 1.0, so I decided yesterday to break the seal, install it and try it out, with the thought of releasing it to let other people learn from it.<p>

<b>Disclaimer</b><p>

The problem I had was with the disclaimers. Let me disclaim here that this is not a supported product. If there's interest, we will start a DG around it, but for now if you have comments or questions, please post them here. Your questions may not be answered. Please don't <a href="http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/89q2/hat.488.html">complain</a>. Thanks for listening.<p>

<b>Download</b><p>

You can download the Frontier 1.0 package here:<p>

The StuffIt archive contains two folders, each containing an Installer app, which is just a self-extracting archive. Disk 1 creates a Frontier 1.0 folder, and disk 2 creates a Frontier SDK folder, containing C source code showing you how to build scriptable apps. I believe there's a good chance that apps built with the SDK works with Frontier 6. <p>

I ran it on System 7.5.5, and it worked without any problems. That's always good to know. ;-><p>

I hope you enjoy Frontier 1.0. It's an interesting loop back in time, you can see ideas and philosophies that would eventually take root, and some that didn't.</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img>
