This is the part of Akilesh's problem I don't understand.  His web site, almost by definition, must be up 7*24 -- it's on a service provider.  It's just that he's not online the whole time.  I think he's misunderstanding what he can do with his web pages.<p>

I think we're trying to solve the wrong problem.<p>
