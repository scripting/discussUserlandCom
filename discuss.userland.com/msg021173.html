The XML files are available for anyone to take, right? Didn't you advertize them yourself? If Aaron and/or Isaac clearly marked this as a repackaged Discuss.Userland.Com DG, would there be a problem? Is your intent that these XML files *not* be used for aggregation?<p>

I'm confused now. The confusion goes for me to the root of the issue that you make your content available via XML; once its in that format, how do you exercise control over what uses people make of it?<p>

If the issue is copyright, is the XML clearly marked to be copyrighted? I'm looking at the DG, can't find a copyright notice on this page or any other.<p>

Thanks for listening. I'm asking these questions because I truly don't understand the problem, not because I want to flame :)<p>
