Just a checkbox. The mail message would have the URL of the response, ready for you to 2click on it.<p>

Also, the Prefs page could have checkboxes for which subjects you're interested in receiving notification for. An example, say you were using Frontier as an XML database and wanted to be notified, by email, when something new happened there. That wouldn't be unprecendented, other websites have that feature already.<p>

Of course if you're receiving mail notification, each mail message would have a URL that turned the feature off. <p>

Bottom line: it's some combination of email and the web until people are in the habit of checking the web, and until equivalent channels develop on the web.<p>
