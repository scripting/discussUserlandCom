This is what Bernie DeKoven's been asking for.  I've been working on it for a while, in my spare moments.  The page explains about the outliner and links to it.  I'm not directly linking to the outliner itself because it relies on Netscape 4.x.  I intend to get it cross-browser: I just haven't got around to it yet.<p>

This is an alpha - it works and is bug free in most of the important ways, but it isn't feature complete yet, as the page explains.<p>

Be aware that I'm not rushing to finish this.  I have end-of-semester responsibilities at work that have my attention for the next couple of weeks.  I just want people to know that it's out there.<p>
