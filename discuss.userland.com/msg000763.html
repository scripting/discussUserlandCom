For quick docs on a command-line function, try <command> --help<p>

For example, "ls --help"
That will show you that a really good use of ls is to do "ls -alF".
Also as others pointed out, the man pages are very important. Finally I suggest ditching the GUI at the start. Don't be afraid of the command-line!
Finally, I also suggest NOT using the machine at the console directly, but telnetting in from another box. It's easier, you can copy-paste without problems, and do whatever else you want to do.<p>

Once you grasp it, you can't go back.
Henri.
