I used to live two blocks down from the Anne Frank house, and worked a block and a half above - so I passed it everyday. The tour barges passed right in front of work, on the way to the AFHuis - and while shooting an in-house promotional video, I goggled the tourist's eyes - we extended a camera crane out the top floor of our studio for exterior shots, and here I was right above the tourists on the canal. Good Photo Op on both sides - I got my shots, they got theirs!
