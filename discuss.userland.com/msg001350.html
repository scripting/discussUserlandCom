"You will be able to specify a set of guest databases that are automatically opened when the web server is initialized, before the server starts taking hits."<p>

I think this is an important feature.<p>

One issue: if Frontier is running behind IIS, WebSTAR, or similar, then the hits may be coming in through COM or Apple events.<p>

I'm not sure what the right thing to do is -- if the server is still being initialized, and a COM or Apple event message is received, perhaps a simple page stating that Frontier is starting up should be returned. The user could be asked to try the request again.<p>

The IIS-Frontier DLL could perhaps be made smart enough to watch for this page, and re-try the COM call after a short delay.
