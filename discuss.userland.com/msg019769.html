(Eric's post already has 1400 reads at 7:30AM. He's the master flow-builder. Totally in awe.)<br><br>Reading Eric's description, and the Register article, it's becoming clearer what Nautilus is, and at the same time it's clearer <i>what we're doing</i> with Radio UserLand. They seem pretty close. A difference, we're bringing the power of the Internet, as a browsable editable hierarchy, to Windows and Mac users. At least for now, they're focusing on Unix users. Eazel probably does icons better. (Although we have users who can do icons, hint hint.) We do outliners pretty well. And we have an object database running behind it all, which is a important but largely secret ingredient. I'm sure they have some stuff we don't. (Yes, they're open source too, thanks for pointing that out. I love that this medium is so interactive, even at 4AM. My opinion, that and 50 cents won't get you on the subway anymore.)<br><br>One thing they will have is tight integration with the filesystem browser, because they *are* the filesystem browser. At one point I considered taking Radio in that direction, but punted. It's a lot of work, for not much gain, because people generally prefer to use the filesystem browser that comes with the OS. That's what Microsoft and Apple do, and Eazel. (Does Eazel have competition?)<br><br>The icon-capable version of Radio UserLand for the Mac is released. Brent works late. I started early today.<br><br><a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg081600.htm">Dan Gillmor</a>: "It's hard to argue with the customer,'' Dell said dryly.

Everything else, of course, *is* a mystery. Now I discover that unbeknownst to me, this exact topic is being <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19766">discussed</a> right here at UserLand.<br><br>I gave myself a lot of grief for revealing personal feelings on this site yesterday. "People don't come here for that," I said to myself. Wrong. Some complain about me doing that, that's for sure, and some tell me to stop, but they keep coming back. If I were to always paint a pretty picture like "Everything's always great!" then you might as well watch TV, the production values are better. The interesting thing about a weblog is that a little humanity might slip through. Ooops, they caught me being human. Shit happens. ";->"<br><br><i>No pain, no gain.</i><br><br>
