Actually, you'd probably have to offer a subscription for something besides just the web sites-advertisements, but obviously you could thrown in the "no ads on the site" as an inducement</font></i><p>

Some free web-hosting sites do this now. You get a website hosted for free as long as you can put up with their choice of ads and such. But for a small monthly fee, you can have your site on their server without the cruft.<p>

I suspect the subscription fee for viewing a site would have to be *very* low to get people to pay for it in preference to seeing the ads (which many people no longer notice, anyway).<p>
