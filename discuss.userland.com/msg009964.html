This has already been done to a limited extent with frames, and I remember at least one lawsuit that resulted. Not to mention the recent spat about deep linking. These problems are motivated by the fact that advertising is circumvented.</i><p>

This can be done with cleverly simple use of javascript and is much less intrusive, e.g.<p>

<script language=javascript src="http://www.someserver.com/somecontent.js?myaffiliatenumber">
</script><p>

The javascript just writes HTML.  It's invisible to the end user.  I know I've said this before, but the first time I did this with the Excite affiliate program, I was astounded by how easy it was.<p>
