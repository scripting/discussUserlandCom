The HTML control is sitting in my System Folder right now! (And it's even IE5.) Look! I'm using it right now. See? I'm not crazy, am I?</I>  <p>

No, you're not; Outlook Express has used the IE HTML control for a while now. Try linking some regular HTML pages (they need to be local, not on the Internet) to Outlook Express 5's Help folder, you'll see that the rendering engine is not quite done yet, otherwise IE5 for Mac would have been released by now!  <p>

The ActiveX control of IE for Mac has been around for several years, starting with version 3.0. It was installed by default by Mac OS 8.0 and higher, and was implemented in several non-Microsoft products, among them:  <p>

</UL>  <p>

I'm wondering if Eudora on Mac has support for it too, but hidden or incomplete (of course the Windows version has for some time); if you're using Eudora 4.2 or 4.3, click on this:  <p>

Looks promising, doesn't it? Unfortunately, the switch doesn't seem to do anything when set to 'y'.  <p>

As long as Outlook Express is the default Mac mail client, by Apple's agreement with Microsoft, you can always expect to find an IE control to use. And for simpler tasks in Mac OS 9 or later, there's HTMLRenderingLib. Not perfect, but a start.  <p>
