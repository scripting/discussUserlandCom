However I bet a lot of people who do weblogs can't do it, or don't know how to do it, or don't have the time to learn how to do it, or their MIS/Sysadmin people wouldn't let them do it. One thing we know for sure is that they can edit the text of an XML file. So, while I can program the server to handle an HTTP redirect (I will), we also have to have an XML-only solution. We have to support both mechanisms, IMHO.
