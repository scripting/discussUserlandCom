I'm using #2 for threading messages in my mailserver, and it works really well for me. <p>

And as for the e-mail interfaces, we're closer than you think with the mail. (Not that I speak at all for userland, this is with regard to my mailserver working alongside manila)  I need a full weekend or so to get it together, and maybe more to make a good out of the box experience.  <p>

Currently I can have email to a specific address dump into a local discussion group or go through an xml-rpc interface to any net-accessible discussion group.  I also have some code that will take any message in my mailserver and deliver it to any xml-accessible discussion group. <p>

I'm planning to do an 'intersection' of manila and mailing lists. Not quite manila, not quite mailing lists. (but comes with a slice of cantelope at the end)<p>

I've also got a script that will mail you any replies to your posts in a discussion group.  See: <a href="http://www.wiredfool.com/discuss/msgReader$40">http://www.wiredfool.com/discuss/msgReader$40</a><p>

There are also a couple of other dg -> email pieces of the puzzle out there.  I seem to remember someone doing a daily digest mailing from discussion groups. There is also the new post notification, which for some of the discussion groups has been pointed at a mailing list. (for example, the frontier discussion group is pointed at the frontier-server list)
