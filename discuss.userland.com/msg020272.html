All you need to do is provide a trivial method to protect your content, like bad encryption and then if anyone breaks your encryption to access your IP in a way you dont want, then they have broken the law.  Just think about it, provide a simple access control on your content and have it be a Federal crime to violate your access control.  Wow, I cant wait...
