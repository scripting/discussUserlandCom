This is more of an evangelistic piece than a thorough analysis. Open source is the Trend of the Year, as Java was, or object oriented programming a few years back. When it comes down to it, people will compare products to other products. For development environments some portion of the source will be given away and others will be kept private. Our cone is inverted the other way. We developed a kernel and editors that are  private, but we keep piling on free source code to show people how to apply it. There is no purity possible as long as Intel and Motorola don't publish the source for their chips. We'll eventually completely figure this one out, but by the time we do there will be something else for people (ie reporters) to be hysterical about.<p>
