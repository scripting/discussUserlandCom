<blockquote> And if we put Manila on a "thin" box like a RaQ3, would it be a "Manila wafer?" </blockquote><p>

Cood Quote. Catchy Name.<p>

You know.<p>

On second thought.<p>

I want one.   In fact, I want a rack of them. I'd like to be able to call up Penguin or someone of their ilk and order a Manila Wafer. Put it down, key in an IP and a serial number and be good to go. Preinstalled and everything, with a Cd of an image of the initial configuration. Give me a year+ warranty on the HW.  Make it work out of the box with no futzing on the OS config. Have VNC/timbuktu/X screen sharing installed.<p>

Make it ~ $2500 for HW + Software and capable of current p3/500 ish performance. <p>

If I need to scale, I want one fedexed for delivery tomorrow.  Cheap enough that I have one as a cold spare.<p>

Is there enough demand to make a market?  Dunno.  I still want one.<p>
