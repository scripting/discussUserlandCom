For example, you'd want a new server to be able to accept requests created by older clients on the new server URL, no? Otherwise you'd have to upgrade all your clients before installing a new server. Well, if you want to solve this problem you'll have to add code to the server that checks the version of the request, anyway.<p>

Dave, if you see a way around this that works in the long run, let me know. I've thought about the problem for a long time and nothing comes to mind. BTW, that's one reason for pushing for a separation between transport, encoding, and the information that the server needs at the spec level and not just at the implementation level.<p>
