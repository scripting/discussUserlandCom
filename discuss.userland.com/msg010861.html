Scientific American: <a href="http://www.sciam.com/1999/0999issue/0999levin.html">Throat Singers of Tuva</a>. "Testing the limits of vocal ingenuity, throat-singers can create sounds unlike anything in ordinary speech and song--carrying two musical lines simultaneously, say, or harmonizing with a waterfall." <i>Throat singing *is* amazing.

You can <a href="http://www.sciam.com/1999/0999issue/0999levinbox5.html">experience throat-singing</a> right now, Scientific American has a page with links to QuickTime scans. Remember when you're listening, you're hearing a <i>single</i> human voice.<p>

Wow! Jakob Nielsen found it, sort of, and lived to tell <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10885">the story</a>!<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10888">Lawrence Lee</a>, the master of the search engines, found the Times story using a trick that most web readers wouldn't think of. <p>
