running into difficulties.<p>

Whenever myUserlandSuite.registerChannel accesses newsToRss.xml on my news site, it gets a "302 Found" html page, then complains that "RDF"
doesn't exist in the resulting html code. This makes sense, but doesn't
explain to me why mainresponder is sending a "302 Found" message. I read somewhere that "302" means a redirect, but as far as I can tell, it's <i>not</i> redirecting.<p>

Now... I <i>do</i> have config.mainresponder.domains.default pointing to another table, and "news" in that table points to news.root. Could this be a cause for my problems?<p>
