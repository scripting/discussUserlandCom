For background, here's the url, <a href="http://slashdot.org/features/00/05/11/0153247.shtml">http://slashdot.org/features/00/05/11/0153247.shtml</a>.

Does a company have the right to ask/make a web site take down material that the company feels is under NDA?  That's the question that has to be answered.  <p>

These are tough questions and I make no offers to answer them.<p>
