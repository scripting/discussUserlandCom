Sorry, I was just being flippant.  <p>

But although my head tells me that this smooth interface is just window-dressing, my heart tells me to play and interact with it.  It's just a shame that I don't have Danny Goodman working for me.<p>

Window-dressing an interface *does* attact people and encourage them to use it.  It also helps attract VCs. It's more important than it should be.<p>

This reminded me of another XML-based site, from Guy Murphy (<a href="http://www.guy-murphy.easynet.co.uk/">http://www.guy-murphy.easynet.co.uk/</a>, IE5 only), who I used to meet for lunch.
