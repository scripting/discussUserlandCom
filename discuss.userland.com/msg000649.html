Basically, you're using Java to write a customized browswer for your site.<p>

For this to be useful to site developers in general, there would have to exist tools and templates to make authoring such an applet-plus-content easy. And the resulting lack of user-interface consistency could be a nightmare. I'm not advocating this approach, just speculating.<p>

But we're not really talking HTML browsers anymore, but customized XML/etc. browsers delivered through HTTP/HTML and Java...<p>
