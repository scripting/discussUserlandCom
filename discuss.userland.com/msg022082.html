If you're in SF on Thurs be at <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?BFCat=&Pyt=Tmap&newFL=Use+Address+Below&addr=924+Sansome&csz=san+francisco%2C+ca&country=us&Get%A0Map=Get+Map">Hunan Restaurant</a>, 924 Sansome and Broadway, 6:30PM, 415-956-7727. We've reserved 20 spaces, but it looks like a sellout, so <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/dinnerInSfOnThurs">sign up here</a> if you're coming and we'll ask for more space. You get two fantastic pundits for the price of one Chinese meal. It's been a long time since I've seen Wes, totally looking forward. <i>"Let the schmoozing begin!"</i><br><br>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/14/technology/14SOFT.html?pagewanted=all">New version of Windows Introduced</a>.<br><br>I started a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/directory/1026/speeches/linksForOreillyP2pConf">directory</a> for the O'Reilly conference, which starts tomorrow. I'm speaking on The Two-Way-Web. Now I have to remember out <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/bootstrappingthetwowayweb">what it is</a>. I'll link the slides in <a href="http://slides.createastandard.com/slides/14/1">here</a> when they're ready.<br><br>New docs: <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/websiteTools">About Website Tools</a>.<br><br>I got a haircut and a beard trim. I must look sexy. It's amazing how when I lose the mountain-man look the women start noticing. It's nice.<br><br>A few people have asked if they can use the white-on-orange XML <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/whiteOnOrangeXmlIcon.gif">icon</a> on their sites, and the answer is yes, but only if you use it the same way. It must link to an XML file that's equivalent to the HTML page that it appears on.<br><br>Scripting News is now an official publication since it has an ISSN: 1533-8185. Tell your friends. What does it mean? I'm not sure. But it's official.

I think we're writing for different Webs.<br><br><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/02/13">Doc on Radio</a>: "Radio Userland is the first application that completely turns around the distribution model by which we've conceived business for the last century or two. For the first time, the power to distribute doesn't just belong to supply. Now it also belongs to Demand." <i>I love Doc.
