Coincidentally, I am marking my final year undergraduate projects today and two of my students implemented a Linux-based public messaging system using old, keyboardless, mouseless, 486 PCs with Navigator.  One of the projects incorporated a simple keypad connected via the parallel port for forward, back and 'more info' functionality.  The URLs for these were (optionally) encoded in the <title> and the remote-control utility was used to script Navigator.  We called the project(s) Intranet Exploiter ;-)<p>
