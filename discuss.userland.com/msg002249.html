sets, so representing European characters is no problem at
all on the XML level -- no need to invent weird tags for
that purpose.<p>

I guess that what you describe as "correctly" means that
Frontier doesn't handle this at all -- it just passes ISO
Latin 1 (or ISO-8859-1-Windows-3.1-Latin-1, to be specific)
without specifying an encoding in the XML header.  While
XP correctly defaults to UTF-8 (an 8-bit Unicode encoding)
in that case.<p>

Try modifying the XML header to include encoding='ISO-8859-1'
before passing it to XP.<p>

Don't know if the Userland folks are working on Unicode support
for future Frontier versions, but they probably should ;-)
