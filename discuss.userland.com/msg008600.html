Thanks, Dan, for being persistent and making this happen.  <p>

I always knew about VisiCalc as the precursor to the spreadsheets I started on (MultiPlan and 1-2-3), but it's a realy thrill to have a copy of the real McCoy and see how far we have (and haven't) come.  <p>

But now I want more.  I'd like to see the source code for VC and other products.  Hey Dave, get Symantec to give you the sources for MORE so we can get a real outliner on the PC!
