Yeah, it's sort of strange, but Gtk+ and Qt <I>are</I> much better toolkits. Motif was designed by a vendor committee, and nobody used it to create real applications until far too late. Gtk+ was written to support a single application, and Qt was the work of a very small company.<p>

X itself is pretty cool--it's nothing more than a network-distributed QuickDraw. (Dave Winer would probably like this, or at least the spirit behind it.) Most of the bletcherous bits are modular, just like the widgets. Because of this modularity, X has survived from the days of the PDP11 until 1999. Not bad, even if it can't anti-alias fonts yet. ;-)
