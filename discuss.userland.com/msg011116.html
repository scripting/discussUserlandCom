Such a service would track links between annotations and URLs, but it would keep the annotations in a separate pane or window, so that they do not obscure or appear to be part of the page they are annotating. Let's also assume that such a system would be implemented so that the original page's HTML would never be modified in any way. Assume that the system doesn't introduce any security problems.<p>

Is this acceptable? I don't think you can argue that it would be a violation of copyright. Do Webmasters have rights beyond copyright?
