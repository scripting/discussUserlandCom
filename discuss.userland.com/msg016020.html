They basicly span a whole range of port numbers, can choose them at random, and can pipe through known port numbers to serve non-standard content. Thier whole purpose is to be HARD to administer(therefore hard to restrict). I can understand thier desires, but as a Network admin I find these programs to be EVIL. They remove MY control of MY network.</i></font><p>

I am probably wrong but I want to comment on this. Not addressing you, William, since I don't know you or your situation, but I think you're in error. Here's why... <p>

You should be a hero. But you can't be until you grok that...<p>

The network you manage is the *user's* network. <p>

While there are exceptions, perhaps you, my experience is that network admins, especially firewall/security admins, don't believe that. It shows up in poor internal customer service and long delays to support the tools of the day. You may not recall, but it took <ul>
<li>3 years for the majority of network admins to let *email* flow over firewalls, fearing security breaches
<li>2 years for users to browse with *http* outside the firewall, instead of promoting web use, 
<li>1 year for net admins to kill off Pointcast instead of adapting to it, and 
<li>such paranoia or narrow focus on security instead of enablement that other powerful communication tools, like instant messaging, are routinely denied service.</ul> 
I suggest that your profession is actually provoking the work-arounds that deprive you of control because you misuse that control. <p>

You can change this by accepting the user empowerment challenge: to put as much capability to communicate and collaborate, peer to peer or otherwise, in the hands of as many members of your community as possible, as quickly as possible. <p>

Be a hero of the people.
