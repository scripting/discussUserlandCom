Linux is being increasingly marketed and promoted like Windows or Mac OS. No matter how you package or sell it, its Unix and if you put it  on a  network without securing the services and keeping proper patches, you are inevitably going to get nailed. I've had to deal with this issue in the past and it happens because people really don't know what they are doing.<p>

Linux is really for gear heads. Newbies need to know what they are getting to and education seems to be the key.
