AOL's recent purchases of Moviefone, NullSoft, and Spinner.com show that they're not going to let the web move without them, even as they defend their core space (and compete with MS to make people think that their environment IS the web).<p>

But I'm a miserable tout in the stock world, so maybe that's the best sign that you're right about shorting them. ;-)
