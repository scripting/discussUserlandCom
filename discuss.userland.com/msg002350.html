The first is an article from PalmPower Magazine (<a href="http://www.palmpower.com">http://www.palmpower.com</a>).  It's an older article (June 1998), however it compares the four main outliners for PalmOS head-to-head.<p>

The second is that I wanted to mention that THINK, the gnome outliner for Linux has reached a new version.  Instead of supporting text from Emacs outline mode, it has now moved to XML.<p>

Wouldn't it be great to have these hook into Frontier!  Has anyone started on a suite that might make this a reality?  How many would be interested in such a suite, even if it was only as simple as taking THINK's XML file and importing it into Frontier?  Or taking a text file (somehow generated from one of the palm outliners) and importing that into Frontier as well?
