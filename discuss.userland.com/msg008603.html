Disclaimer: half-remembered waffle ahead:<p>

A while back I was involved in doing a bit of research in order to get some guidelines together for a web site.  As part of this we did a small usability test on a group of people with the site in question.  One interesting thing we noted was that while people <I>were</I> happy to scroll a web page (contrary to the expectations of some of our design colleagues) they did not resize the browser window from its original size.<p>

Draw your own conclusions (if any).  The test was only a small one so I can't say it's scientific, but there may be some logic in there.  It seems to be supported empirically by some of my own personal observations.
