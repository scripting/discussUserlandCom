Then, Pike can attach to a server, and they can talk back and forth on that connection. Many other programs do this, telnet, ftp, quake, etc.</i><p>

Well, from that list, ftp is the posterchild for not working with NAT without a specific FTP protocol module. (i.e., it is possible to not be able to make a connection if the right combination of NAT firewalls are in the way)<p>

Quake takes UDP forwarding, IIRC.  (unless they changed it)<p>

And telnet is a connection from the client to the server.<p>

Pike is a different animal.   It is event driven, but those events come from the server. Requests for pages to be changed originate with the server. <p>
