I will probably (if I get the funding) get involved in establishing a scientific web-forum, where a panel of "sages" will have to comment on the news posted there and those "sages" should be able to do this within their browser environment.</i><p>

Try this model on for size:<p>

Each "news item" is a discussion group message, and starts a new discussion group message thread.<p>

Your "panel of sages" can comment on the "news item" by replying to the message.<p>

The list of topics is then a list of news items, each with its related commentary.<p>

The one catch I see is that the commentary is in separate messages; this doesn't quite do what you want if you want the commentary on the same web page as the "news item." (Though, since it runs within Frontier, it could be made to do so.)<p>
