The articles there were well-written and interesting, but they weren't interesting enough, and weren't relevant enough to my immediate needs, to convince me to subscribe.

A lot of other Linux users must feel the same way about <i>LJ</i>.  It's a <i>good</i> magazine -- but there are so many ways to use Linux (as a platform for learning how to hack Unix, as a way to make an old PC useful, as a Web server, as a database server, as a router, as part of a Beowulf cluster for scientific computing, as an embedded system, etc.) that any one Linux magazine could only appeal to a fraction of Linux users.</p>
<p>
Compared with the total (estimated) number of Linux users out there, how many people read <i>LJ</i>?  How does that proportion compare with, say, the major Mac-related glossy magazines?  How many readers are actually paying <i>their own money</i> for <i>LJ</i>, instead of putting it on some company's expense account or library budget?</p>

As for Slashdot ... read Orwell's "Notes on Nationalism".  There are, in Orwell's terminology, "positive nationalists" for Linux, and "negative nationalists" against Microsoft, and a lot of them post to Slashdot.  They are displaying a general weakness in human nature, not a special weakness in the Linux development community.</p>
