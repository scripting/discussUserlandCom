Where were you when I was asking for recommendations after the <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5376">nightmares</a> with Dell? Hey at least I'm doing something about it. Tomorrow I'll talk with the guy from Dell and see if he's interested in solving the problem, or offering me extra personal service because I write in public. And maybe some other cloner is reading and wants to take a stab at providing excellent service to the Scripting News people.
