I'm looking for some better background info on where RSS came from. Here's what I think I know:<p>

-RSS was introduced by Netscape ~ March 99 and is used by my.netscape.com to display "channels".
-Dave Winer added RSS support to www.scripting.com which was already using its own XML format, scriptingNews.
-Dave Winer introduced my.userland.com which is similar to my.netscape.com.
-RSS 0.91 was release and incorporated additional elements based on recommendations of Dave Winer and others.<p>

Could someone confirm or correct these assertions?<p>

Jonathan.
