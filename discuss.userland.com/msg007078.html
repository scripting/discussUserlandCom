I was looking for a way to include this in my final filter script.<p>

I know it was possible using Brent's Commands on Macintosh (using pbs.utilities.parseRelativeUrl) but this seems to be broken due to a reference to the toys table.<p>

So if anybody knows of a quick and foolproof way to do this let me know.<p>

PS. Maybe Brent still has the uncompiled code lying around somewhere?
