I'm not exactly a member of W3C. But I follow the w3c activity since a long time. <p>

I would know if it's possible, what is exactly your goal? I imagine you want to participate to the development of the recommendations. But, what do you hope from W3C? Is there any desire?<p>

Just to know what do you need? Just to know where the effort must be made to enjoy the members?<p>

Best Regards
