in more precipitous situations it's definitely a no-no &#150; at least, if you have a heart<p>

consider the "next paradigm" in software (distributed computing), or Apple's UI innovations (which obviously were far too tightly controlled), or nuclear power for a solid physical-world example<p>

if they're released with no restrictions, it's very likely there will be restrictions placed on them by the first party to come encounter them... malevolent or otherwise<p>

if the state of our rules governing information (copyright, patent, intellectual <em>property</em> &#150 ha!) wasn't overblown and irrational, it would probably be fine... and I think we've made it past some of the worst times: individuals, consumers and special interest groups are beginning to aid in balancing corporate power<p>

personally I don't feel that public domain is appropriate for software licensing... GPL fits quite well
