But on a serious note I agree with your definition of respect.  Some of the people I most disagree with also have my deepest respect.  On a similar note I always encourage my students to question what I, and others say and do and not to necessarily accept conventional wisdom.  I used to think that all the questions they asked were due to the fact that couldn't understand my subject.  Now I realise they were just being extremely respectful ;-) <p>
