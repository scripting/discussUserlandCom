Outliners.Com: <a href="http://www.outliners.com/thinkTank2Pc.html">ThinkTank 2.41NP</a>. (IBM PC, 1987) "There's a routine that clicks the speaker, every time the software checks for the Escape key. Originally I put this in as a way to be sure that it was checking often enough during lengthy operations. I left the sounds in, people thought ThinkTank had a motor!"<p>

Outliners.Com: <a href="http://www.outliners.com/more30.html">MORE 3.0</a>. (Mac, 1990) "All the other outliners were love affairs that were over quickly. On to the next thing. A new platform, a new way to sneak into memory with other apps, try out a graphic platform, try again, then again." <i>MORE 3.0 was different.</i><p>

TechWeb: <a href="http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19990804S0020">Classic Software is Reborn on the Web</a>. "A handful of the pioneering developers of groundbreaking applications, such as VisiCalc, Turbo Pascal and C, ThinkTank, Ready! and MORE, are posting original versions that can be downloaded for free."<p>

Our T1 line is getting swamped again! MORE 3.0 is a big download, 1755K. I'm glad so many people are downloading it. And Ric Ford is calling antique software a <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/earlymac.html">hot topic</a>. Cooool! The Mac has an interesting history to explore and until now there hasn't been much of that.
