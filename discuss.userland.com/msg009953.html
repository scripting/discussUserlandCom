Second, you can certainly run Frontier 1.0 on that old Mac. Frontier 1.0 even ran on System 6. (We made a big deal about that, we even had IAC running on System 6, with the UserLand IAC Init.)<p>

You can download Frontier 1.0 thru <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$9458">this page</a>.
