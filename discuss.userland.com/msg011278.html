I think we have to remember that the article was wriiten by some journalist. The above sentence by Paul Maritz only lacks the end part "...and operating systems.".<p>

I think MS Marketing go a bit nuts sometimes trying to define everything as "Microsoft" and annoy a few people - thing is, is that not what marketing is anyway? I know in places I worked in they were always on PRP money.<p>

I think its a brave move with SOAP. They own so much of the market for PC's that it makes you wonder why they are bothering. I exepect they realise that with XML, it is going to happen and I suppose they want to be right at the center of it.<p>

The thing I like is that they worked with Dave on this, taking into consideration the fact hat an RPC method was already here. Unusual I have to say from Microsoft (or anybosy else for trhat matter). Wouldn't it be cool if everybody just worked together like this instead of inventing new and competitive specs?<p>

Cheers,
Steven
