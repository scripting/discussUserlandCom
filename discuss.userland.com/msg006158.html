There is also the code to add keywords to discussion messages.<p>

If I may add two items to the dg wish list:<p>

1) I find that I often read the full thread, or essential parts of it. I would prefer to get all the texts of a particular thread presented on the same page. <p>

2) I find it difficult when I come to the discussion group page to locate what has happened. Often I have to go back to the previous day, and look through the list and try to remember what was there last time I read it, so that I can figure out what is new.<p>

I know the dg has a 'last message read' for me. Maybe this (or better: a 'last headline shown') can be used to put out a marker in the list; and to make that my starting point when I come to discuss.userland.com.
