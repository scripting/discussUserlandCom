In any case, I think of OpenDoc like QuickTime.  If you display QuickTime, then you can display a VR document or a 3D file or a movie.  The application doesn't have to know what type of movie will be displayed, they just have to provide a window through which QuickTime can play.<p>

OpenDoc was the same thing except that any OpenDoc Editor or Viewer could display in the Window.<p>

Have you looked at the Java tools which Apple now provides?  I haven't used it, but the JManager appears to give you the ability to play Java Applets in any application.  Is there a Java based HTML renderer which you could instantiate?<p>

Combined with the Apple Applet Runner, this could give you some of what you want.<p>
