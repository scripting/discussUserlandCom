Best thing to do is to use mod_rewrite and use regular expressions to redirect to the right place.
Alternatively, you could write a Frontier script that goes through the whole structure of your site, looks at all the files that are RAW and prints to a output file:<p>

RAW_file_path      Redirected_file_path<p>

Then when you move the whole site to Linux, you write a Perl script that reads that output file and for each line:
1- deletes the RAW file
2- If the Redirected file is on the same machine, creates a symlink (alias/shortcut) with the name of the RAW file, pointing to the redirected file. If the Redirected file is on another machine, create a .asis file with the redirect info.
