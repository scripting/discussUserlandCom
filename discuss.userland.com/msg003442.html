From the standpoint of an average brain (cognitively), this works with hierachical structures, but not with parallel structures (like information distributed over guest databases). I'd rather have a table config.rainbow.urls so that my configuration can rest in ONE place.<p>

Otherwise, I'd always have to remember rules like this: "If someones tries to log on to your server app and is not yet logged on, then the person will be routed to the discussion group's logon page unless you have a URLs table defined in the scope of the current website table."<p>

On the other hand, if it's like this, so be it, but I want to *understand* why.<p>

In this context, I'm beginning to understand that htmlinterfaces.root is nothing more than the container for the *discussion group's* html interfaces, while the name of this db seems to pretend something more general: the place to store *all* html interfaces.
