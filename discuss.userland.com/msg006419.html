It'd be pretty slick if command line and GUI apps could be scripted with RPC commands, i.e. something like "netscape&nbsp;-xml-rpc" would begin taking XML-RPC requests on standard input and returning replies on standard output.<p>

I created a <a href="http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/~ken/xml-rpc/cli-xml-rpc/">demo app</a> using the Perl Frontier::RPC module that serves the ``States'' XML-RPC demo from the command line.<p>

This demo also has a unique feature that it accepts multiple requests on a single stream by using a sequence of characters that are otherwise illegal in XML to seperate the requests.  That sequence is "--]]><<".  This sequence is illegal because it both terminates any possible CDATA section and it has two `<' characters in a row.  An illegal binary character could have been used instead, but that wouldn't be readable either.
