I don't actually mind the zone files too much. The best thing about them: comments. You can leave a record of why certain hostnames are assigned to particular hosts, or include the phone numbers for your MX sites. Think of each zone file as an essay explaining your DNS configuration, and you'll see what I like about them. I've seen sites with pages of documentation in these files.<p>

My screwup wasn't caused by the zone file, per se--it was caused by a bad data field and a lack of sanity checks. The name server should have been a bit friendlier in this case, and warned me of a probable error. In my case, at least, the same UI concerns would have applied to a graphical DNS manager.<p>

But Dave's right--we have a mostly-completed XML-RPC interface for managing a DNS server under Linux.<p>

Cheers,<br>
