That's good.  Even if we don't hold grudges, folks here might not know that, and it can confuse future interpretation of our writings if it looked like someone might hold a grudge.  (I know, that's convoluted.)<p>

Josh Allen: <i>Like you, I feel that getting even is a major waste of energy, and I really didn't mean to rile you up. I'm not sure where things broke down, but I am sure I could have been more sensitive about how my comments would sit with you.</i><p>

Getting riled up was partly my fault, by mistaking your remarks directed to Todd Blanchard as if they were to me.  I thought about this more, and I realized I actually work with a few rules of thumb I evolved over time to prevent some kinds of misunderstandings.  I'm thinking about writing up some of the techniques briefly on a web page.  <p>

I'll post a link later if I do this today.  I hope it doesn't seem like I'm offering unasked-for advice by discussing my approaches for avoiding misinterpretation in public forum writing.  It might seem interesting to some folks.<p>

Josh Allen: <i>I still feel that your points of view are interesting and valuable, and hope you continue to share them.</i><p>

This is very kind, and I'll keep offering my perspective.  I'll try not to be sensitive to some kinds of responses.  And after I write something up, it will be easier to see what kinds of things I might accidentally see the wrong way.  (But it's kind of embarassing to pose as if I expect anyone to write according to my terms, so don't take it that way. :-)
