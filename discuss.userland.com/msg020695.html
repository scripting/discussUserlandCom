The low level of literacy? The poor health care? Pervasive manlnutrition? The control of the government by drug cartels? Institutionalized racism? Use of police departments as occupying forces? <p>

Or is it the lack of opportunities for entrepreneurs to sell their assets to multi-nationals?  The lack of a choice between right wing business and "sort of right wing" business controlling government?<p>

I suspect I wouldn't be very comfortable in Cuba, although as a skilled, professional, I might not do to badly. Probaly quite a bit less comfortable than I am in Canada.<p>

But if I were a First Nations person living on one of the Northern reserves or on North Main in Winnipeg, I might not see it the same way. ....If I could get access to an education that would let me see it at all.<p>

In Canada there probably aren't enough people in that position to provide a base of support for a Hugo Chavez.  <p>

But poor people frequently hate the rich and sacrifice liberal democratic principles in the pursuit of economic well being. Get used to it.<p>

And finally, ask yourself what Cuba would have been like without American sanctions. Castro didn't fall from the sky and he wasn't innate in the mind.  He was the result of social practice.  ("Remember Leon Trotsky"--The Fugs, Dirty Old Man circa 1967)
