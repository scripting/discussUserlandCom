However, a quick review of Bay Area ISP's that were participating in PacBell's fast network revealed that no one has updated their prices (which bundled the DSL line plus the IP connection) in light of PacBell's announcement.<p>

You'll need to call Best, Concentric, et. al. to get prices.<p>

I'd like to hear what people find out.
