The help-page didn't answer them, and I didn't know where else to look, so here I go making a fool of myself :-):<p>

 1) Does discuss.userland.com have an nntp-interface? (I prefer to read discussion-groups with my trusty newsreader).<p>

If not:<p>

 2) How do I read the messages following the threads without going back to the root for each branch (which takes a "lot" of time from across the atlantic)? If I use the Prev/Next-links I'm taken to the next message (by date, I assume) and not to the next message by thread, which is what I would like.<p>

  Thanks,<p>

   Adam.
