There is something really exciting going on here, that harks right back to the early days of the web and some of TBL's ideas about the semantic web.<p>

There would be three components to a distributed application environment that allowed you to build an application within a browser from a set of components on the web: 
1. A network infrastructure that allowed you to search for these components. 
2. An IDL based on XML to automatically integrate the components. 3. A metadata framework based on XML to find out about remote data.<p>

1. A half way house between Napster-like and Gnutella-like networking, with XML based RPC calls to content and a simple metadata description for the payload that is returned - could realize some of the aims of the 'semantic web'. 
In other words I search the web for any methods that describe how to spell check in, lets say, German - and this functionality is found and added to my application, in realtime, on-the-fly.<p>

3. A universal getMethods() method, which defines an interface in an RDF-like manner to return all of the methods available at a particular resource and the paramaters they take (like a DCOM lookup). A universal API defined in XML if you like.<p>

3. A modular RSS system to account for all types of metadata.<p>
