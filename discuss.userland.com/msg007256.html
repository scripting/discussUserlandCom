I have a lot of problems with the new UI. I've been relatively silent on this issue - but since you are asking for feedback :-)<p>

1. What purpose es having "My.Userland.Com" in HUGE letters at the top of the page? How does this graphic relate to your left navigation? <p>

If you are going to brand the site like this, at least let your left hand navigation lock into a grid with the "My.Userland.Com" type. perhaps the hairline rule should lock up with the '.' in 'My.'<p>

Its also disterbing that placement of objects on the right, in no way relate to the navigation.<p>

2. Why do we have right justification on the left, and left justification on the right?<p>

You use indenting as a structural meathod on the right - this makes the placement of type in your navigation meaningless. You have a hairline rule there, do we really need to right justify the navigation as well?<p>

3. Why is the members box so special? (ie - treated so differently from everything else?) I keep looking at it. Its a little eye magnet and I don't know if it needs to be.<p>

4. italic type in web browsers is difficult to read, and doesn't look very nice. Incorporate it into the "My.Userland.Com" graphic. It will look ten times better.<p>

5. Your color palette is great. (although I'm a little iffy on that brown...)<p>

6. Flow seems nice as well (linking from screen to screen), or should I say - "the transactional elements work well."<p>

Anyway - those are my thoughts.
