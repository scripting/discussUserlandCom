That the serialization scheme, and data formats, were not part of the SOAP spec.  If this is the case, then could it not be that we need to wait until we see the specs before we can declare NGWS a boon or bust for standards.  <p>

MS's Win2K Kerberos debaucle is an example of some of the problems.  I am sure thier authentication headers are standards compliant TCP/IP, however they aren't good Kerberos.  But MS says they support standard Kerberos, which they do, but only one way.  <p>

Using HTTP/XML/SOAP is, if I understand it correctly, just a way to get data from point A to point B and to describe it in a general fashion. It doesn't preclude MS from sending downright cryptic data down the wire.  <p>

Just a thought.
