As a relatively inexperienced programmer, I was able to come up with my ASP implementation.<p>

The SOAP spec is 25 pages long and poorly written.  I've printed it, but not got much beyond that.<p>

I think that's why not much is happening.  I'm also thinking that MS must be working on their own implementation surely.<p>
