Maybe some power users like having .com automatically appended to their typing in a site, but most newbies don't have a clue. That's why the Smart Browsing feature was invented and why it will never go away. Because every effort is being made to the make the Net more logical, more helpful, not less so. Just because Person A grabbed x.com before Person B doesn't mean everyone in the world should automatically go to person's A Web site. There should be more logic to such a system than, "First come, first served."<p>

You have a choice. I have a choice. If you don't like a feature found in your Web browser, either turn the feature off or switch to a Web browser which doesn't support the feature. I just don't understand why that's so difficult to comprehend. It's like listening to a radio show and then complaining about the crude language you heard while listening to it.<p>

Change the flippin' channel!<p>
