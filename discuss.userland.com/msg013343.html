we are a media and design agency located in Vienna / Austria. the agencies name is Fox and actually we are very excited about Frontier and escpecially about Manila. Togther with Tom Fuerstner and Christoph Pingel of the Center for Art snd Media we are developing a completely  different looking Manila-Weblog. <p>

I think this project really shines in featuring the flexibility of Manila built websites.<p>

Enjoy it and we hope you like it the way we do !<p>
