I think that Cooper must have a hard heart, Ballmer was great, and fatherly, and sweet, and it may have been an act, if so, it's an act he does very well.<p>

Also, I posted a comment on their discussion board, but for some reason it hasn't appeared yet. That was about 15 minutes ago. You can post one there too, they have space for reader comments at the bottom of the piece. Let's show ZDNet readers that they have a choice, they don't have to take Cooper's word for it, they can find a Web that works differently from his.<p>
