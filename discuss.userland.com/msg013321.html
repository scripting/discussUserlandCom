<a href="http://www.bump.net/">Bump</a>: "UserLand  released Frontier 6.1 today. I've been using the betas for a few weeks now, and have set up a server running their Manila framework. It's really, really, easy to set up and configure. It's also really easy to use to build sites. I expect to chronicle my experiences, and those of the others who are using my server to create sites, right here on Bump. Someday soon, Bump will be a Manila site. Update: I'm up to five sites on the box now. People are digging it. I'll post a list when people have stuff up and want to be pointed to." <i>Schwinnng!</i><p>

<a href="http://manila.userland.com/werbach">Kevin Werbach on Manila</a>. "The coolest thing about Manila is that it's as simple or as deep as you want it to be. Few other Web products scale well in both directions -- you either wind up with easy-to-use homepage-building tools that can't handle dynamic sites, or you have complicated, expensive content-management platforms that aren't helpful for beginners or small sites." <p>

Can you believe it? Red Hat is deliberately <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/340590.asp">taking on</a> Microsoft. "Our competition is not the other Linux distributions. Our competition is with Microsoft." Who makes their strategic decisions? Maybe they hired someone from Netscape?<p>

We flipped the switch last night and the "store" is now delivering fresh new 6.1s. Be the first in your quadrant to jump into the age of Edit this Page. Current Frontier subscribers can download 6.1 from the support site.<p>

<a href="http://frontier.userland.com/changes/61">Frontier 6.1 Change Notes</a>. In addition to Manila, 6.1 includes browser-based installation and admin, a user interface builder for web apps, kernelized web server, safe macros, automated nightly updates, scheduler threads, lots of new verbs. <p>

Please, if you're a Frontier user or developer, post questions about 6.1 in the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/">Frontier DG</a>. <i>Thanks!</i><p>

I find that <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/discuss/msgReader$286">adding a picture</a> of Gandhi helps lighten a DG posting. BTW, since he's in the UserLand.Com <a href="http://glossary.userland.com/$3">glossary</a>, you can include him by typing "gandhi". Also thanks to Keola Donaghy, I have a picture of "curly" in the glossary too. <i>Excellent!</i><p>

Curly appears on today's <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/">home page</a> on Manila-Newbies, which I am also maintaining (I hope to pass this off soon.) He says "I try to think but nothing happens!" A perfect slogan for newbies. ";->"<p>
