"How is Manila like Eudora, FileMaker Pro, and BBEdit?" <i>It's a scriptable application.</i><p>

<a href="http://barista.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$67">Josh Lucas</a> implemented the Java equivalent of the code we released today for Frontier.<p>

As Dan Gillmor said <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg02200.htm">yesterday</a>, Internet developers create platforms that have APIs and developer programs. Today we have released Manila's API in an easy to program-for package.<p>

8/22/95: <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform">What is a Platform?</a> "The author of an API is offering a challenge, saying 'blow my mind' to everyone who might take a stab at implementing something on top of the API."<p>

Pike, coming soon, is a desktop application that builds on the Manila API. You might think of Pike as the MacWrite of the new web writing environment we're building. A simple app with the essence of a new idea, that can be expanded on and competed with, as Word, Pagemaker, MORE and Quark XPress were refinements of ideas pioneered by MacWrite.<p>

I'm sure this is totally confusing if you don't know a glue script from a hole in the ground, suffice it to say it's a step down the road to something that (we hope) every person who writes for the Web will want to use. <p>

<b>Evening work</b><p>

I just figured something out peeking behind the scenes at tomorrow's Marc Canter piece. He links to a ShockWave page by Stuart Sharpe. I sat there clicking on things, and then I realized that Stuart isn't doing presentations, he makes <a href="http://www.ssharpe.com/circles.html">musical instruments</a>. But they always play something sexy no matter how you click.<p>

<i>I think Marc has been telling me this for years, but somehow it just sank in.</i><p>

<a href="http://www.weblogs.com/stories/storyReader$256">I'm working</a> on the hotlist code, making some changes, adding some of that infamous logic, but not too much.<p>

<b>Search engine evangelism</b><p>

Do you know any business development or engineering people at search engine companies such as Google, Atomz, Yahoo, Inktomi, AltaVista, Lycos, Excite or Ask? If so, and if you like Manila, you can help us get more great searching, preparing for a million sites this year, and help us focus on making the editorial system work better and better.<p>

Here's how you can help. Send them a pointer to this <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$318">open proposal</a> to Search Engine developers. <i>Thank you.</i><p>

BTW, this proposal should also interest our competitors, whose users will want smarter and faster searching too.<p>

<a href="http://www.atomz.com/news/pr19991208.tk">Atomz.com</a> appoints Robert Carr and Marylene Delbourg-Delphis to the Board of Directors. I knew Robert when he did Framework for Ashton-Tate, and Marylene when she was CEO of Acius. I sent an email to their PR people asking them to look at our proposal.<p>

I just <a href="http://www.atomz.com/search/?sp-a=00070329-sp00000000&sp-q=web+site&sp-g=100&sp-i=1">set up Atomz</a> to search scripting.com. (It only found two pages here, heh heh.)<p>

Even though today's a national holiday in the US, we're still going to release a Biggie. This one is for Frontier users, although when Pike is released it'll be for them too. Hint: It'll make it easy for you to write scripts that connect your workstation (Mac or Windows) with your Manila site. <p>

<a href="http://spicynoodles.com/">Andre Radke</a>: "One year ago today I started working for UserLand." Wow! The blink of an eye. I feel like Andre's just getting started. On second thought, the reason our servers are running so smoothly these days is Andre's work. I like Andre so much. He's smart, disciplined, and (most important) he laughs at my jokes. ";->"<p>

<a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/love2.gif" title="Oh the irony! Could this be Hillary's revenge for Monica? What does this say about her taste in men?"><img src="../misc/snImages/love1.gif" height="67" width="100" border="0" hspace="15" align="right"></a>Last night <a href="http://www.bradlands.com/">Bradlands</a> spammed the "Hotlist". I thought someone might. We can easily correct for the technique he used. But maybe this could run on the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22honor+system%22">honor system</a>? (And before any ninnies say I'm criticizing him, I like Brad, and if you view source on his home page he's merely asking whether we need popularity contests, which is a fair question.)<p>

So here's the answer. I have no idea, but I like to see what makes my sites move up or down each kind of list, and I learned a lot about how the weblog world links into our sites, and it's already lead to some plans for improving the flow of our sites, so to me, it's totally worth it, after one all-nighter and two scans.<p>

While I was traveling Sheila and Brent stayed at my house. Sheila took <a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/stories/storyReader$212">some pictures</a>. She also left a little plant, which I spaced out and forgot to water. Not to worry, I caught it in time, and hosed it down last night. I'll post a picture later.<p>

Isn't it amazing that CNN <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/cnnStillSucks.gif">still hasn't fixed</a> the display of their site in MSIE5/Win? I cannot read the text on their site. It's too small. Is anyone home at CNN?? Of course Yahoo <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/yahooDoesItRightOfCourse.gif">has no problem</a> with the same story.<p>

One of my favorite <a href="http://gonebutnotforgotten.userland.com/">web pages</a>. It's where we redirect from sites that are gone. <i>But not forgotten.</i><p>
