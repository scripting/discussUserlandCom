If you have VB5 or later or VC  5 or later (enterprise edition) you should have a development license of SQL server.<p>

I'm just about to learn SQL server so I don't know about what books are good, but you shouldn't need another app to create databases... at the very 'worst' you could use SQL statements to create your data models.<p>

I'll know much better in the next couple work days though! -- we're moving <a href="http://dlcd.ctt.bc.ca/">http://dlcd.ctt.bc.ca/</a> from Access97 to SQL Server 6.5 SP4. :-)<p>
