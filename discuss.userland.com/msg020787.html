That's not entirely correct.  All of the proposals for the RDF+NS version of RSS were presented, discussed, and debated on the <a href="http://www.egroups.com/messages/syndication/236">syndication</a> mail list beginning in June.  It was only when it came time to put together the proposals into a single spec that the proponents of RDF+NS took it offline.
