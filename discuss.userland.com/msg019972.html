When writing my doctoral thesis, I survey original works, and 250 years of additional scholarship, giving credit where due and pointing out bugs where I feel that others have erred.

Which makes sense: one of the guiding principles of open-source development, it seems, is an attentiveness to the choices made over several generations of computing history. Hence the GNU manifesto; hence ESR's maintenance of the <a href="http://www.jargonfile.org/jargon/">Jargon File</a>; hence Slashdot's frequent pieces on the evolution of UNIX and its variants, and Andrew Leonard's finely-researched <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/www.salon.com/tech/fsp/index.html">Free Software Project</a>.
