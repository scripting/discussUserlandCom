How big do you think the foreign aid budget is? I'd suggest doing some research to find out. The size of the foreign aid budget is something most people are prone to vastly overestimating (and your list of priorities below suggests you have fallen into this trap.) <p></i><p>

Approximately $15 billion as explicit foreign aid. Billions more as military aid refocused as economic aid. Not counting debt forgiveness for past military purchases, etc. A disproportionate share is consumed propping up the socialist governments of Israel and Egypt.<p>
<i>
Also, I'd like to you respond to the following argument "Drastically reducing the foreign aid budget is penny-wise, but pound-foolish. Foreign aid is an investment in the future of the rest of the world that pays dividends in greater future stability and more profitable opportunities for future trade.<p>
</i>
<p>
Ask the former Soviet Union what their foreign aid bought for them.

<dd>  To call upon a neighbour and to say:--
<dt>"We invaded you last night--we are quite prepared to fight,
<dd>  Unless you pay us cash to go away."
<p>
<dt>And that is called asking for Dane-geld,
<dd>  And the people who ask it explain
<dt>That you've only to pay 'em the Dane-geld
<dd>  And then you'll get rid of the Dane!
<p>
<dt>It is always a temptation to a rich and lazy nation,
<dd>  To puff and look important and to say:--
<dt>"Though we know we should defeat you, we have not the time to meet you.
<dd>  We will therefore pay you cash to go away."
<p>
<dt>And that is called paying the Dane-geld;
<dd>  But we've proved it again and again,

<dd>  You never get rid of the Dane.
<p>
<dt>It is wrong to put temptation in the path of any nation,
<dd>  For fear they should succumb and go astray;
<dt>So when you are requested to pay up or be molested,
<dd>  You will find it better policy to say:--
<p>
<dt>"We never pay <i>any</i>-one Dane-geld,
<dd>  Nor matter how trifling the cost;
<dt>For the end of that game is oppression and shame,
<dd>  And the nation that plays it is lost!"
