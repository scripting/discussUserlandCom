You never know.<p>

Of course will support the current way Pike works with Manila forever, it's too good and complete to ever stop doing it that way.<p>

But the <outlineDocument> format will be fully supported too, in ways that the Manila connection could never do (at least not given my current understanding of the problem). There's something fundamentally different from a document that's intended to be rendered into HTML, and one that must preserve all of its structure even while it's being browsed. <p>

On the other hand, who knows?<p>

One things's for sure, if you like <outlineDocument>s and want to use them to bridge to Zope, that will be very easy to do in Pike.
