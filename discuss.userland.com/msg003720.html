Yup. XDrawLine, XDrawString, XDrawText, XDrawRectangle, XFillRectangle are all there. MoveTo is missing, but that's because X is supposed to be re-entrant.<p>

GraphPorts are different, though, because of the nextwork. X calls them "windows", but not in the modern sense of the term. Think of a whole bunch of little, sliding GraphPorts nested inside each other, and you'll grok X. Your screen is a window, your windows are windows, your scrollbars are windows. "Windows everywhere!" to quote a certain CEO. ;-)<p>

That's just about all there is--everything else is a protocol, a convention.<p>

<I>It would be great if the Mac graphic API were supported. You have no idea how many people know that stuff at the base of their spine. (Like me for example.)</I><p>

That would be a fun hack! Apple still has a patent on QuickDraw regions, so you couldn't have those. But the rest would be pretty easy. LineTo, MoveTo, FillRect. I still remember QuickDraw, too! Why did nobody else make it so easy?
