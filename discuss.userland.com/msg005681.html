Most musicians don't get paid all that well by the record companies. If I were a musician starting out I wouldn't even bother trying to get a recording contract. I'd distribute my work as widely as possible using MP3, without trying to charge for it at all, and make money the same way most musicians do: live performance. The recorded music becomes in effect an advertisement for the live shows. It worked for the Grateful Dead, the most financially successful band in history I think, and unlike the rest they encouraged their fans to make bootleg concert recordings.<p>

It puts the record companies out of business, but I'm starting to think that in the long run, any business model based on restricting access to bits is doomed.
