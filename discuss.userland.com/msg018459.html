Sounds like he is talking TeleScript again....</I><p>

Yeah, it does. Maybe it's finally time for TeleScript; God knows it was ahead of its time when it came out. It had features--mobile code support, accounting support, high-quality security--that Java still lacks.<p>

More generally, I think we're inching, step by painful step, to a real appreciation of the value of distributed computing, and there are a couple of major ways to do distributed computing: you rely on human beings to distribute the code, or you rely on code to distribute the code. So far, we're seeing a great deal of the former and, to a first approximation, none of the latter. Will that change? It's an interesting question to contemplate (to me, anyway).
