Cool..

Don't worry about me, I don't easily feel slighted (and certainly not now) and I don't hold grudges.  Like you, I feel that getting even is a major waste of energy, and I <i>really</i> didn't mean to rile you up.  I'm not sure where things broke down, but I am sure I could have been more sensitive about how my comments would sit with you.  In the spirit of Dave's "adoption", I will point out your site at www.treedragon.com, that has some really interesting thoughts.  You pointed this site out to me some time ago, and I thought then that you had some interesting points of view.  I still feel that your points of view are interesting and valuable, and hope you continue to share them.
<p>
Peace
