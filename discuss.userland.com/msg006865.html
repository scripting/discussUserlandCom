Context should be sufficient to make it clear what is meant. In the newspaper business, does 'column' refer to, say, Dave Barry's weekly writings or a vertical grouping of type on a newsprint page? <p>

In scripting parlance, is a 'table' a set of TABLE, TD and TR tags, or a collection of SQL database records, or an ODB object?<p>

The human brain is up to the task of figuring it out in most cases. The two uses of 'weblog' are sufficiently different (a record of hits vs. a creative work) that I don't think this is a big deal.<p>

This will be my last post on it...Dave's right, let's spend our energy on something worth the effort.
