I've long thought that the euphoria over XML was somewhat unjustified, and there's no wonder the press is pouting now. Agreeing to use XML is like agreeing to use Latin-based characters and have words separated by spaces for natural language. It's great that we can agree on parsing (and have great free tools like James Clark's to do it), but the real <i>social</i> work is agreeing on vocabulary and semantics.
