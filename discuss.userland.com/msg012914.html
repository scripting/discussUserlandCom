<I>Whether you gather the preference data by query "Did you like it?" or inference "They looked at this page for N seconds." it's still collaborative filtering.</I><p>

In that case, I'd expect to wind up running afoul of someone's patent.<p>

<I>There's no reason to have a cutoff at all. Sort the data according to predicted interest, and the user can quit reading when they're tired.</I><p>

If you do that, all you've done is create a search engine where you've tried to predict the search. I do agree that an easy shortcut to seeing all choices is needed; I don't agree that presenting all choices up front is a good idea unless the total number of choices is small--say, no more than seven, which, as I recall, is what cognitive science tells us is the maximum number of things the average human can contemplate at once.<p>

<I>Large quantities of data are more important than clever algorithms at providing useful results.</I><p>

Two words: "search engines."<p>

Or, if you want more detail, "AltaVista" (large quantities of data) vs. "Google" (clever algorithms, useful results).<p>

<I>Filtering entire lists is far less useful than filtering specific topics within a list.</I><p>

And I believe I've said as much.
