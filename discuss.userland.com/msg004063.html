Apache is neither multithreaded nor event-driven, which are the two accepted server design patterns. Thus it isn't as efficient as it could be. As Chuck pointed out, it isn't the fastest Web server.<p>

Until recently I would complain that it couldn't load binary modules (i.e. you had to recompile Apache to add modules). This has been added recently, although I don't know if a server compiled in one environment could load a module compiled in a different environment. (If you're wondering why this matters, I don't want to install software that has to be compiled; it's a waste of my time and my computer's time.)<p>

Configuration is text-based and somewhat confusing. Enlightened Solutions is working on a great GUI configurator for Apache, but I haven't seen it.
