This is probably chilling because it is true.<p>

There are two ways to react to this insight that I (and many others, it should be admitted) had a few years ago:<p>

a) Try to limit the influence of Internet patents. For example, they might be granted for 5 years rather than 17 years in order to work better in the fast-moving environment online.<p>

b) Self-defense: Get some patents of your own so that when somebody tries to serve you with a patent suit, you can fight back because you will have a patent on some things <I>they</I> need.<p>

Strategy (a) is one you take to your political representatives because it requires changing the law.<p>

Strategy (b) is one a company should use internally. If it doesn't, it will regret it. Because without some patents of your own, you <I>will</I> wake up and find yourself the target of those companies that do file patents.
