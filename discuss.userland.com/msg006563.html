Anyway, we're singing the same song. Go to <a href="http://www.on24.com">http://www.on24.com</a>, then navigate to more.... in Top Stories.  There you'll find this: Microsoft (MSFT:NASDAQ) 
05/21/99, Linux Journal's Doc Searls discusses the Linux Open Source Platform, Microsoft's role 2:49 Doc Searls, Senior Editor, Linux Journal. <p>

It's in RealAudio. The singing happens mostly in the second part of the clip: "Open source is one of those things that Microsoft would do best to embrace."<p>

I also believe, however, that Bill Gates comes from competitiveness as much as Steve Jobs comes from art. I think he lives for the battle. And so does his whole company.<p>

I've been told by Microsoft folks that the best way to get a project going is to ligitimize a competitive threat. I think the company is motivated by many other things -- especially serving users. But competitiveness runs too deeply in its character. I don't think they'll ever hang up their gloves.<p>
