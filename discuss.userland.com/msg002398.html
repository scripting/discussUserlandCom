The shear flexibility for me so powerful.  Not only can you store the information in a variety of formats, but you can write scripts that change the format or structure from within the same environment with out using another tool.<p>


I think that it's power also lies in the fact that I was able to learn and shape my thinking in a freely availible environment, to build demonstraitions for administraitor (I'm a teacher in Arizona one of the lowest per student funding states) to help justify the purchase.  I was able to prototype a number of systems (that we are using now in Frontier 5.1.6) to convince them that it was worth the money to purchase an educational package (Thanks Dave and UserLand).  Also I was able to do this in a very short time, and have been able to begin scaling it to a district wide implementation. All in my free time as a full time teacher and new father. <p>


Form an educators point of view the only really comprable product (price is the essence of comparison in schools) the only thing that I could find that could do <i>some</i> of the same things was FileMaker Pro.  Yet it's limitations and lack of flexiblilty outweighed it's ability to  deal with data in a relational way.  All the other products at the time (maybe even now, I'm too invested/excited by Frontier) seemed to not have the content-management that I needed.  Personally I have travel down the road with UserLand personally for a while (I was a passenger enjoying and using products) from Aretha release on.  I'm a teacher, free alway appeals to me.  I worked in the Clay basket (I even still have a site out there in mangaged by Clay).<p>

I hope this is a help, I have to go and dig.  Here come my students...
