This is not about the technology behind Napster, or even about the boatloads of money that the record industry is going to lose as a result of the spread of this technology. The Napster model is not evolutionary (as the buycott proposal seems to imply) but revolutionary; the record industry has very real reasons to be concerned. They are about to be done away with!<p>

Let's not kid ourselves. The record industry has no intentions of embracing this way of doing business; they perceive it to be much more of a threat than an opportunity.<p>

To reward them for stunting innovative ways of doing business sounds unreasonable, even if it does buy us some airtime on CNN.
