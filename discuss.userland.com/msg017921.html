Chefs do their best work on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. They are fresh off their days off and ready to put forth their best effort, as well as not being as busy as on Friday.<p>
Weekends are considered in the restaurant trade as the time for tourists and the "great unwashed", and customers certainly don't get the same quality of food (due to logistics, budgets, etc) as you will earlier in the week.<p>
Just a thought from a "foody".
