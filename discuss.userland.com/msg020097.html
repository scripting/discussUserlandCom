<ul>
 <li>"Here's my source, don't blame me if anything goes wrong"  --  MIT, X, and the new BSD licences
 <li>"Here's my source, don't blame me if anything goes wrong, and present our copyright on all documents and splash screens" -- Original BSD
 <li>"Here's my source, don't blame me if anything goes wrong, and don't try to misrepresent where it came from" -- Artistic
 <li>"Here's my source, don't blame me if anything goes wrong, and any changes you make and redistribute must also be open source" -- LGPL
 <li>"Here's my source, don't blame me if anything goes wrong, and any changes you make and any code that builds on this code and is redistributed must also be open source" -- GPL
</ul><p>

There's already "softer GPLs": LGPL, Artistic, Original BSD, MIT, X, and new BSD.<p>

Losing the hype, the GPL and LGPL let me say "I'm giving you the fruits of my labor and I <i>demand</i> you do the same if you use my code."  If anyone doesn't want to make that demand, lighter licenses will suffice just fine.
