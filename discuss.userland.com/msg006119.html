This makes non-linear navigation in a thread easy. It could be set in a preference in the forms at <a href="http://prefs.userland.com">http://prefs.userland.com</a> so that default behavior is as it is now, and if a user prefers to see whole threads, they could switch the pref on. There are probably other things a user might want to set in a preference too, and this would encourage people to sign up, instead of just lurking.<p>

Also, though only tangentially related, it would be nice to see a frames version of the DG, with the main links in a static frame at the top, a pair of frames down the left side with the calendar, and either the current thread, or the topic list, and then a larger content frame on the right. I'll make a sample screenshot and post it when it's done...
