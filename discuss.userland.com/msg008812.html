I need a way to email a street address somewhere and get back the latitude and longitude for the address. I'm thinking that maybe Frontier can get the email and submit a query to mapblast and then parse the resulting page to get the latitude and longitude and email it back to the sender. <p>

It sounds weird but I'm a ham and I'm messing around with APRS (Automatic Position Reporting System). You can hook a GPS receiver up to a radio and your computer and TNC (it's like a modem except it passes the data to the radio for transmission instead of a phone line) and have your position constantly updated. I'd like to do away with the GPS receiver since the radio I'm getting has everything else built in. <p>

Frontier probably can't do what I want but I'll never know if I don't try or ask!
