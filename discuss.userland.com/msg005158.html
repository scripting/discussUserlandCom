It is a basic project site manager that behaves in pretty much the same way as the Discussion Group application. The main difference is that instead of arranging messages (which are called tasks in this app) by date, they are arranged by client and/or who is responsible for the task.<p>

I built this app for two reasons. One, I needed a get-my-feet-wet-with-Frontier6-app so that I could learn how mainresponder works. Second, our company needed a basic communications vehicle for one of our new clients and needed it quick. This means that, as far as I'm concerned, it is incomplete. It does what the client wants, but it isn't the Project Site Manager that I want it to be. I plan on rewriting it from scratch, but that won't be for a while. (My boss and the client were so impressed with Frontier 6 that he is having me write another app that has priority now.)<p>

Anyways, feel free do with this as you please. I have included some readmes to get you started, but you can email me with questions. The scripts are not as well documented and are not as elegant as they could be, so feel free to contact me if there is something you don't understand.<p>

If you find any bugs, I'll definitely fix those or if you do it you can let me know what you did. I won't be adding any features since I'm going to completely re-write it, but I would appreciate any comments or suggestions for the next version.<p>
