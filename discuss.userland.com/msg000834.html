That sounds strange to me...<p>

... Have you heard of "Wine" (<a href="http://www.winehq.com/about.html">http://www.winehq.com/about.html</a>), an environment for porting Win32 aps to Unix/Linux? That's somewhat analogous (but inverse to) what Tenon did with WebTen, fusing Apache with their MachTen code to bring it to the mac.<p>

But I don't mean to tell you how to run your business; I'm sure you know far, far more about it than I. I'm just being a curious Frontier groupie.<p>

Best of luck.<p>
