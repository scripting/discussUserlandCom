<i><language> -- A name of a language, in English, the language used in the text of the channel. This allows readers to exclude channels that are in languages that he or she can't read.</i><p>

There is an ISO standard for languages (the two-character codes) which is also used by HTML. It wuld be nice if all Web apps used the same notation.<p>

<i><imageHeight>, <imageWidth>, <imageCaption> -- Two numbers and a string that indicate the dimensions of the image, and provide a helpful caption for the image. (Not sure what to do with the last item.)</i><p>

Why not just have a <img src="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/..." width="..." height="..." alt="..."&gt; tag? It seems like a lot of the channel formats are duplicating a lot of stuff that's already in XHTML. (I know that the SN format is older than XHTML, but if you're going to add stuff to it, it seems like it can't hurt to be similar to the standards.)</img>
