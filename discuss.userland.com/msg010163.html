I suppose Xanadu would solve all these problems, but hey we're stuck with the World Wide Web today, so you're all going to have to SUFFER!!! Condolences in advance.<p>

Sheez.
You don't actually believe anybody will be able to do anything useful with all that source code, do you?
Take a look at the code. It's mostly uncommented glue gluing glue to glue.
Nothing reusable there.<p>

Have you gotten it running? The documentation included was not very helpful.
Is there a web page that tells me how to run Xanadu?
Did you have to install Python, and run it in a tty window?<p>

What would be much more useful, would be some well written design documents and port-mortems,
comparisons with current technologies like DHTML, XML, XLink, XPath, HyTime, XSL, etc,
and proposals for extending current technologies and using them to capture the good ideas of Xanadu.<p>

Has Xanadu been used to document its own source code?
How does it compare to, say, the browseable cross-referenced mozilla source code?
Or Knuth's classic Literate Programming work with TeX? <p>

Most of the stuff that's going on with XML is much more down-to-earth, up-to-date and interesting.<p>

A simple, reusable library like Jim Clark's Expat XML parser gets me a lot
closer to my goal, than all that hot air about grandiose theories that have
never been tested in the real world.<p>

I agree with you, but let them have a little bit of sunshine. Ted Nelson was
a big influence on me, and for that I am grateful. Dave<p>
