It is supposed to load off of the game GD (Sega's proprietory CD/DVD middle-of-the-road format), the idea being that the system can load the OS off of each disk, allowing for seamless "updates" to the OS.<p>

I'm sure MS gets a small cut of each of those disks.  (It is probably well-deserved, though; from what I hear it's a pretty good tool set, although one must keep in mind that console programmers aren't exactly used to tools such as "debuggers" and "code libraries" that weren't developed in house.)<p>

Of course, that's in an entirely different market (despite all efforts to bring it together).  Will MS do that for a "computer", their "core market"?  When Linux and BeOS are either free, or nearly so?
