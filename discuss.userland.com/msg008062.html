I agree that there are a lot of parts that are very confusing when coming into UserLand. An introductory guide would be most helpful (not been here long enough to volunteer). The UI assumes a lot of familiarity, and has more than its share of quirks.<p>

I find it helpful to keep in mind that it's all experimental. At least, I think it is. It certainly isn't your run-of-the-mill channel/discussion site. From what I've seen, Dave et al are too busy thinking up the next version of whatever's going on to refine the current one too far; it's a very high turnover sort of thing.<p>

My biggest peeve is the timezone thing, although living in Australia for the past few years has made me adept at this particularly twisted form of math.
