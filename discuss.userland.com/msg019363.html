Except, of course, that that's how the average user's website is set up. For example, my (now rather long-in-the-tooth) <a href='http://www.primenet.com/~reynol/'>Reynolds Virtual Workshop</a> will disappear if I fail to make my monthly ISP payment. <a href='http://SpinwardStars.com'>Spinward Stars</a> costs me a monthly fee, as well, but at least I could relocate it, since it's my domain.<p>
