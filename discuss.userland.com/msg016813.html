When nobody (aside from production house) wants to pay more than about $50 for a scanner, shoving ethernet, drivers, etc. would drive up the price pretty substantially. OTOH, it seems to play directly into HPs new direction for printers.<p>

Why can't the scanner hook into your computer and do everything you want right there? I don't know how Windows deals with scanners, but most Mac based scanners operate off of a <a href="http://www.twain.org/">TWAIN</a> interface. I can't see any reason why your products couldn't hook into that and provide the very service you want - you need to put TWAIN support into Frontier. <p>

Then, you could hook your scanner into some client machine with some Frontier derived product attached (Pike might be a natural, being the most end-user product) or into some server machine where the scans could be individually directed into your Manila site. Basically you substitute a computer for the need to move the scanner industry. Not a bad trade-off.<p>

Another thought: Maybe there's a new market here. Rather than build your fractional http server into every little product out there, maybe somebody ships a little Cubeish device that can serve that role, hooking into peripherals via USB and Firewire and providing a workgroup interface to them - printspool, image library, jukebox, whatever. It wouldn't need much ram or storage, could be web configured, etc.
