Let's wind this discussion down. There haven't been many new ideas in the last dozen or so messages. From this point, if you have a new idea to contribute, go ahead and post. If you are just saying "I don't think so", let's skip it. If everyone posted a message when they don't believe something, this DG would be swamped with such messages. Let's up the content ratio here. Thanks.
