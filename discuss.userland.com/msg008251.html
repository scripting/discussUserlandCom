Even w/ ADSL your bandwidth is getting pooled upstream at the ISP, just not locally in your neighborhood.  You may get your guaranteed 256k, or whatever, to the ISP...but I don't think any ISP provides a guarantee that every ADSL user coming into a particular hub will get that level of performance going out of they're system to the net at large.<p>

To provide competitive service, they got to manage how many users piggyback on the same T3 or T1 or whatever, and that will turn out a whole lot different if all those users are running hosting companies than if they just surf the web.<p>

I had to pay a few bucks extra per month to my ISP for the right to run servers on my ADSL, and they're theoretically suppose to be non-commercial--although mainly they don't want me hosting other people's sites...and I didn't think this was too unreasonable.<p>
