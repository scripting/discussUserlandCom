Now, if you want to create some RSS, you can enter a URL instead of pasting in the text. (The old way still works, too.)<p>

<a href="http://www.macrobyteresources.com/rss/index.wsf">http://www.macrobyteresources.com/rss/index.wsf</a><p>

It's not as useful, I think, if you paste in the page's URL. You'll end up with links from the page's "template" in your RSS file, rather than just the pages actual content.<p>

Still, it's better than nothing. Some people (you know who you are) are just too lazy to copy and paste the source into the textbox.<p>
