When will content management (non-distributed-portal) customers see anything new from UserLand?<p>

Will Frontier have any of the following features in the next 6-12 months?<p>

<UL>
<LI>security (object ownership, access rights, sandboxes)
<LI>roles management (who can do what, to what, where and how)
<LI>approval chains (what must happen before a page goes live?)
<LI>dependencies (this page requires the following resources: &#123;.,.,.})
<LI>staging
<LI>version control
<LI>web interface for administration and content providers
</UL><p>

Should I expect to have to roll my own editorial system to get the above features, or are these things I should expect UserLand to provide?<p>

Is Frontier now an Internet development platform for 3rd party developers to sell software to enable content management (etc), or is it still a vendor-supported content management system that wants to compete with other content management tool providers?<p>

When will we see a root update????  (It's been more than two months now since the last update)<p>

Is WebEdit 2.0 going to be released (last thing I saw was beta or final candidate -- correct me if I'm wrong)<p>

Will ContentServer ever be updated to take advantage of Nirvana features or guest databases?  If so, when?<p>

<hr size=2 width=100%><p><p><p>

Let me be clear in saying I think UserLand could do very well in the new markets it is testing Frontier in.  I just need to know where UserLand stands regarding its existing web site publishing customer base.<p>

If UserLand is drifting/has drifted from this space, please communicate this clearly so people (like me) can make informed purchasing decisions -- whether they be Frontier subscription renewals or otherwise.<p>

No news is bad news.<p>

Thanks very much,<p>
