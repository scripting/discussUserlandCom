<ol>Looks like webline.com is in the CTI market--computer telephony 
integration .  Cool stuff, it gives marketers goosebumps; and because it's such a holy grail for the customer service market, it costs major moolah.<p>

Their technology has features you'd want in an online technography infrastructure-- one-to-many broadcasting, fast servers and networks, computer-as-telephone.  However, it's implemented with a huge investment in fast networks and servers, routers and hardware.  The middle-ware software is pricey as well.  People in the CTI industry speak in phrases like 'voice-over-IP' and 'ATM-to-the-desktop'.<p>

There are more differences between CTI and technography than there are similarities.  CTI exists to sell and service a product, technography to support and stimulate people. The technographer is interested in stimulating and focusing human interation to accomplish the goals of the meeting and facilitate decision making.  In CTI terms, 'human interaction'  means, clicking a button on a website, and a telemarketer calls you in 20 minutes.<p>
