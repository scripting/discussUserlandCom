Not, mind you that Free Software has any less of an accumulation of political assumptions...I just like them better :-)<p>

I just have problems trying to associate myself with a phrase broughyt about largely to distance a business model from people like RSM so it could appeal to VC backers.<p>

So while we both know what Free Software is I can't in good conscience actually label myself or what I do as Open Source.<p>

So if you put up a survey asking me if I was an Open Source developer I would have to say no even thought I have released software under a GPL and work in public projects to release free code.
