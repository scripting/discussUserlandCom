In that section once again the shared 
vision concept for the web is contrasted to the powerful desktop computer concept <em>as if the two were mutually exclusive</em> somehow. <p>

One of the notions that I grew up with is to never come to the dinner table empty-handed. Each person should be contributing. Not necessarily today nor not as a child but when adulthood was reached this contribution was expected of each of us. <p>

So it should be for each of us when we approach the web. It depends upon sharing what each of us brings. The most powerful ideas such as 
napster make this explicit and require a substantial computer on our part to act as a server and participate. ---Jay
