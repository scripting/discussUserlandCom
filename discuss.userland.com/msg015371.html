I've been enamored of the tools Dave's provided, but I'm clumsy in using them. Voice programming is so much easier." Mary asks for help from a Manila expert. <p>

Wish: A lively weblog covering patents on "EditThisPage.Com". <p>

We're working with "Moreover.Com" to get an updated news box as a Manila macro containing stories that cover web patents. This will be a sidebar on the patents site. We need an editor, someone who has background either in software or legal issues, preferably both. There's a time committment, you have to be willing to update the site daily, at least when patents are a hot issue.<p>

I've also been thinking about what to do when someone makes a good start at a weblog in an important area, but drops off. Two such areas are <a href="http://wap.editthispage.com./">WAP</a> and <a href="http://svgnewbies.editthispage.com/">SVG</a>. Both areas require coverage, there are new developments in each every day. I suggest if you are interested in these areas, send an email to the webmaster and ask if they'd be willing to make you a Managing Editor. <p>

We didn't get a pointer or a <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/28/noMorePesosForSenorBezos">quote</a> in their story. How did they find Danny Goodman's <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$410">position</a> re Amazon's patents? Maybe Danny called them. It could have happened. And they say Slashdot is working on this, that's great, but we've been doing a better job covering the Amazon patents than Slashdot. They tuned in late. It's OK, eventually they'll want to work with us. I used to be a fan of Wired! Hey I used to work for them. Sheez. My feelings are hurt. I will not give them permission to run the Forrest Gump-like <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$413">picture</a> of Tim O'Reilly talking with Jeff Bezos. <p>

Welcome to the <a href="http://surprise.editthispage.com/zengarden">Manila Zen-garden</a>.<p>

WSJ: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/376822.asp">Start-up stirred a media frenzy</a>. "Today, Mr. Bowlin’s company has quietly closed. Its demise illustrates the burden of overnight success, and offers a reminder that Web start-ups don’t, after all, defy the laws of gravity."<p>

I can't tell if <a href="http://www.kottke.org/">kottke</a> is being sarcastic: "More Web theft! Dave's worked hard over the years on a design for Scripting News, and now all these folks (here, here, here, here, here, here, and here, among others...) have gone and stolen it from him. Frankly, I'm appalled." The sites he points to are Manila sites. The default template for Manila sites looks a lot like Scripting News. I think he's joking, but sarcasm is hard to pick up in text.
