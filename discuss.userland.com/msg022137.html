Excellent interop. Frozen. Lots of happy developers. <br><br><a href="http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/2001/04/04.html#Message_33">Joshua Allen</a>: "A few years ago, when it became clear that XSD spec would drag on for a couple of years and be very complex, Microsoft (and Andrew Layman) decided to make a simple subset called XDR, that we could use for interoperability while waiting for XSD to be finished, and that would also be completely compatible with XSD when it finally was finished. Still to this day I have customers who tell me that a Microsoft competitor told them that 'Microsoft doesn't support XSD, they made up their own incompatible schema language.' And the standards bigots flamed away about XDR."<br><br>Interesting. I didn't know that. Some standards are rock solid, and for those, I am definitely a standards defender. XML and HTTP are two solid standards. SOAP 1.1 needs the shakeout we've been doing. Look at the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/messages">archives</a> of the soapbuilders list. Anyway, I don't mind taking the heat, as long as we continue to run the interop tests, then it'll be safe for developers to do the "BDG" functionality, just forward the nasty emails to me. <br><br><a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/service/index.html"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/fourTrain.gif" height="42" width="42" border="0" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="left"></a> In an interview today I compared SOAP to the NYC <a href="http://www.nycsubway.org/">subway</a> system, specifically Queens Borough Plaza. The cool thing about QBP is that you can switch from the IRT to the BMT there, cutting a corner off a trip to the Bronx from <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/service/sevenlin.htm">Flushing</a>. Originally there were three subway systems in NY, but sometime before I came online (ie before I was born) they got their interop act together so you could freely switch from one line to the other, combining features of two or three lines to create your own customized trip. I imagine that they had a mail list for their interop work, like the soapbuilders list, where the BMT guys thought the IRT guys were a bunch of bozos, but they had to work with them anyway; and the IND guys were worried about getting stuffed into the trunk.<br><br>The editor of soapbox, which I admire, <a href="http://radio.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$5738#5845">posted</a> a newbie intro to Radio as a weblog tool.

I just invented something called Peer-to-Peer, or P2P for short. I hope you like the software I'm creating. It's called JXTA and it's Peer-to-Peer! It's very cool. You'll like it. It's revolutionary.
