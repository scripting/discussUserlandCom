In many respects NextStep / OpenStep was way ahead of its time, and I say this from the perspective of a passive observer of NeXT and a long-time fan of the Mac as a desktop computer.<p>

I don't think Linux bore any resemblance to what it is today when Apple started putting together OS X.  Hopefully, the compatibility boxes and the UI will co-exist well with Linux someday.<p>

If I were Apple, I would come out with a robust, free implementation of the MacOS look and feel for KDE and Gnome.  Many Slashdot fans would dismiss it, but think of the media attention and other benefits.  
(I'll admit, I haven't thought about the implications of the licenses associated with KDE and Gnome.)<p>

The ultimate irony would be to position Macintosh as a desktop computer for people working in truly open computing environments.  Of course, you have to subscribe to the notion that UNIX has huge advantages over anything else as a server OS, and that client OS doesn't matter.  But, I think many Web developers have gotten there already.<p>
