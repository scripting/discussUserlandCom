<a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/lenGetsAResponseFromAmazon.gif">Len MacDonell</a> got a response from Amazon about the patent.<p>

I got a different <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/amazonsResponseToMe.gif">response</a>. I sent an email back saying "I don't believe that Amazon is an uncaring company. I think you got caught
making a bad decision. I could once again be an Amazon customer, but not until this issue is resolved. Let me know if there's anything I can to. Everyone makes mistakes. A company with a strong future acknowledges them quickly."<p>

Rick Segal on Amazon: "Man the folks at my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">former employer</a> must be loving this. You couldn't script it. Amazon takes the lead in the sore winner derby, film at 11. Amazin."<p>
