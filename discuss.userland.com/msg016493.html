So far, Frontier is great at 1 and 3. It looks like Manilla is sorta there for 2. If we can just get an app to do 4 from our favorite outliner, we'll all be happy campers!</i><p>

People new to Frontier, and even those not, often forget that it's a great scripting environment with existing tools for connecting to other apps.  Specifically, there are a number of tools for connecting to QuarkXPress, e.g. <a href="http://www.macrobyte.net/autotools/features/">http://www.macrobyte.net/autotools/features/</a> and the Mac Glue for any scriptable apps (see system.verbs.apps in Frontier).<p>
