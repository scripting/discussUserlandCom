I wanted to let you know, however, that the page crashes Navigator/Mac 4.05 on all of my machines here just about as it finishes rendering. I've tried 4 or 5 different Macs and all have sufficient RAM, so I assume there is something in there it doesn't like.<p>

Just thought you might like to know.<p>

Aloha,<p>
