They say they're aiming at Allaire, and we already know that Allaire is not a CMS. Unless they're claiming to do content management, they're not comparable to Frontier. What we need is someone who knows Frontier to take a look at it. <p>

If it runs well on Linux, by the way, this is really good news. We've been looking for a runtime environment on Linux to target, much the same way people include JavaScript bits in their Frontier sites to control runtime evaluation in the browser.<p>

In this world, at this time, it's more likely that they complement our product than threaten it. My opinion of course.<p>
