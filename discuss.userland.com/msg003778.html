Who found open source software quite funny.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he wrote it for pay,<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was oft heard to say,<p>

"I'll write software for both love'n'money."<p>

&nbsp;<p>

He often worked fifteen hours a day<p>

Writing code which he'd then give away.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It paid him quite well,<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the hours were hell--<p>

he barely had time to roll in the hay!<p>

&nbsp;<p>

For his time, Sonny always charged dear.<p>

He would consult, but not volunteer.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free software is fine,<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He often opined,<p>

"But there isn't any such thing as free beer."<p>
