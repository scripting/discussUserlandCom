Glad that you explicitly wrote this up while the NT Setup was fresh in your mind. Being a Linuxophile, I often have to listen to how complicated our setup process is. The implicit comparison to NT doesn't actually take into account the NT setup process! Too many people just see a "working" NT system; they don't see one that does not work properly. Good luck with that one! *grin* Granting your point that the Mac is the master, all us Linux lovers still appreciate your compliment. And things are only getting better!
