As I see it, this has two major advantages:
<ul>
<li>Very low bandwidth requirements (the only hits come from other servers)
<li>Neither the intrusiveness of email nor the effort required to check a web site, i.e. the perfect push application.
</ul>
This would be ideal for people who don't have the time, energy, or expertise to maintain a web site, and don't update often enough to justify it, or just very irregularly.<p>

It would be fairly easy to put a web interface on editing an RSS or <scriptingNews> file - e.g. the user clicks on a link titled "new item", fills in the URL and the text, and clicks submit. Of course, quite a few sites could easily be supported by an old powermac, since there is so little traffic.<p>
