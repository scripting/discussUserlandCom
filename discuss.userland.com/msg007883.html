Content server looks pretty cool.  Without looking at the code yet, I'm thinking of a tie-in right about now.  I'm wondering the best way to do it.  <p>

1) Write a filewriter filter for the mailserver. (If this works, jpgs by email are possible. It opens a security issue though.)<p>

1a) Authenticate through ContentServer before writing jpegs to disk.<p>

2) Figure out how to make ContentServer import from a temporary frontier object.<p>

3) all or none of the above?<p>

btw, it's incredible to see one's name in lights at the top of the scripting news page for a day.
