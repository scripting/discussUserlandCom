What this means is that I can build a new app on top of Netscape's new rendering and scripting engine, with just creating some gifs, some xml files and a javascript or two.  What I need though is someone familar with how manila sites work - perhaps even running a server themselves - to help me test and tease out features.<p>

If you are interested, please email me at <a href="mailto:andreww@netscape.com">andreww@netscape.com</a>.<p>

Remember this is just my pet project, but if it get's enough support and development, I'll submit it to mozilla.org as and open source project.<p>


I've been successful at creating a crude prototype, but before I release that, I need some "reality checks".<p>
