Actually, my kids' favorite was Kickin' Kiwi Lime, but I don't see that any more. Was it discontinued? Is there a definitive list of Kool-Aid flavors available somewhere?<p>

As for GPL vs. BSD licensing, as Dave points out, it probably just drives commercial innovators to BSD (MacOS X, for example). Though as Wes points out, you don't need to distribute source for things distributed <i>with</i> GPLed software; you just need to distribute source to any changes to GPLed software you distribute. So if Userland made kernel mods to make Frontier work, they'd have to distribute the source to those mods, but not the source to Frontier itself.<p>

And remember, the GPL has never been tested in court, and we all know that noone knows what something <i>really</i> means until it's tested in court.
