It's unfortunate to hear the way one of the quoted analysts Jim Balderston describes Mark Andreesen.  His description sounds less like that of a person and more like a chess piece.<p>

Put this together with the bad-makeup publicity photo and it just adds to the objectification of the man.<p>

What does Andreesen want, what does he think about all this?  Does he have any vision for AOL?  Or is he really just a poster boy for an ad campaign?
