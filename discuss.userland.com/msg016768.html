Most of the problems with MS is its close tie to the OS. Because of that, MS can justify to make free or close to free software. Once the OS tie is gone, the app company will not have that kind of thinking.<p>

For example, when the app company no longer has to think about developing IE for the OS, they must think up of some other way to justify the development cost of IE. They might just spin it off (they might not, of course).<p>

So, I think just splitting MS into the 2 companies is enough. The market will handle the rest.
