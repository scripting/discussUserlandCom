didn't CIL put that into the public domain?</i><p>

Thanks for asking that.  I get asked those questions
now and then, and folks tell me the status of their
personal inquiries directed toward Apple.<p>

No, neither Bento nor OpenDoc were put in the public
domain, and I recall no intention to do so at Apple.
However, IBM has publicly said several times (and in
places you can still find) that they plan to publish
the whole kit and kaboodle for open use.  But since
this does not happen, I assume some old partner in
the CIL business is being passive aggressive.<p>

Most of the sources, including all of Bento, appeared
on CD's for source level debugging purposes.  In
particular, you can find them in the DR5 release. But
the license was not public domain (or open source).<p>

Because I was once the Bento guy (read, the poor sap
who had to cope with ongoing architectural issues in
an existing body of code), I used to hear from everyone
who wanted to license Bento but had run up against a
wall when talking to Apple.  I never heard of a single
instance where Apple cut a licensing deal with anyone
in the last five or six years.  Now I tell folks the
prospects don't seem very good when they pursue Bento.<p>

Bento seems to be used by a few large companies in the
context of older licensing deals.  It works reasonably
well on operating systems with good virtual memory, where
the way Bento uses memory is not so noticeably atrocious.<p>

I was writing a replacement for Bento when OpenDoc was
killed (or put on maintenance, as Apple euphemistically
said at the time).  Before I was ready to reveal it, I
sometimes called it Bento 2.0, but actually it had almost
nothing architecturally in common with Bento at all.
Then I told folks about Quilt just before Apple pulled
the plug on OpenDoc.<p>

I wanted to continue working on Quilt after I left Apple,
because it was based on stuff I had been doing for a
number of years, and I thought it was a good design.
But I gave up talking to Apple about it after I was
stonewalled for enough weeks that it seem fruitless
to try any longer.  That was when I decided to start
over again in yet another generation of database code,
which I called IronDoc.<p>

IronDoc is still vaporware, and I can't work up the
energy to hype it right this second. :-)  It wouldn't
be ethical to do so unless I'm actively working on the
code, anyway.  I have it on a back burner right now.
