From Joseph Campbell's The Hero With A Thousand Faces, <ul>"A hero ventures forth from the world of the common day into the region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man."</ul>Campbell termed this the 'monomyth'. A word he picked up from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (which I gotta read someday...).<p>

Stay warm. Have fun.
