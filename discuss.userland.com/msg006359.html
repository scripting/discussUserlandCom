As far as I know, netFrontier didn't make the transition to 5.0.

From netFrontier's web page... <<a href="http://siolibrary.ucsd.edu/Preston/scripting/netFrontier/">http://siolibrary.ucsd.edu/Preston/scripting/netFrontier/</a>><p>

To download choose the Frontier application as a helper after clicking this link 
NetFrontier 2.2b4 (Posted April 7, 1998) 
Note: This page ealier pointed to 2.2b5 which was an error, 2.2b4 is the latest version<p>

This version requires Frontier 5.0.2b6 or later and root update 57 or later. <p>

       Now cross platform 
       inetd server
</pre><p>

So I guess the question becomes... Are there differences between Frontier 5 and 6 that might prevent netFrontier from functioning?  Probably the best way to find out is to give it a try!<p>

Erin: Although I think you'll be on your own if there are problems.  Errr... at least no support from Preston.  Others here or on the mail lists may be able to help out.<p>
