1. Clinton and Tony Blair committed to this action three weeks ago, when Hussein backed down at the very last minute and allowed inspectors to do their jobs.  Then, we said that if Richard Butler did not find _complete_ willingness on the part of Iraq to allow the inspections, we would finish what we then were about to start.  This was before the House Judiciary Committee had voted (was it before they had convened?), and before the House had taken up the matter, and when public numbers were _very_ against impeachment.  Now, Butler released his report last night which described impediment after impediment -- and we followed through with that to which we had committed.<p>

2. The entire team of national security advisors to the President (Gore, Secretary of State Albright, Secretary of Defense Cohen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Shelton, National Security Advisor) agreed with the strike.  Granted, we do not know the actual process which went into their agreements; that being said, in looking at her past, I find it hard to believe that Madeline Albright can be pressured into supporting something that she doesn't support, and the same goes for Henry Shelton.  Especially given the situation three weeks ago.  (And I just saw Albright's press conference, which just reinforces my beliefs about her.)<p>

3. This has just as much a chance of hurting Clinton as it does distracting people from his travails, and he's probably the first person to realize that.  This is what he would have done even if he weren't in trouble (the past six years have shown that).<p>

Just my $0.02.....<p>
