(It's got a scripting language and object database and website framework and HTTP server.) Andre said he didn't think so. I asked why. He said that I haven't told people that it was OK. Oh. OK, it's OK. Go go go.</i><p>

Oh I bet every Frontier developer got thier hands on Pike and with in 5 minutes had pike.root open in Frontier - and said - oh! nifty. (or am I the only one?).<p>

So yea - I have some plans for Pike, all I need is the time ...
