On second thoughts, it may be easier for my current needs to build the site to be accessed through IIS, slap in a frameset and call the required Manila pages to appear in the frame.<p>

Obviously, the navigator links will have to go but I cannot see a problem with that.<p>

Anyone think of any difficulties I may have with doing it that way?<p>

Thanks,<p>
