Actually, except for the Netscenter issue, I think it makes more sense to have the links make sense in context rather than out.  The sentences on today's scripting news read naturally.  The fact that there are links in them are an added bonus.  It isn't an unnaturaly, mechanical "click here" like break, that we so often see by people who don't understand how to write hypertext.
