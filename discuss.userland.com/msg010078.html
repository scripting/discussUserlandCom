lots of people have tried.  I did, a few years ago, when
trying to figure out if I could implement LZW compression
in the freely available Python imaging library (PIL).
they told me "if people don't pay you for your services,
they're not your customers.  if you offer free services,
you're stupid".  when I asked them if I could publish
that mail, they threatened to sue me for copyright
violation.<p>

on the other hand, I suspect that the very fact that
a computer company like Unisys is still alive proves
that evolution doesn't work under all circumstances...
