Meaning this, if you have the user download some files which then get placed in a directory under the Chrome directory (in their respective content, locale, and skin subdirs) and then install the sidebar using something like "chrome://[[mypackagename]]/content/starting.xul" where starting.xul could be any name as well, and mypackagename is the name of the directory immediately under the Chrome dir.<p>

Make sense?  It follows the same javascript rules as before. Js on your computer has more access than js living on some website.  You can get js living on some website access if you request it via a signed script.
