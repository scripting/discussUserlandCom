Being under license from Merriam-Webster, I'd assume it's of a more recent vintage.<p>

(Speaking of which, any dictionary app should have a feature from NeXT's Webster. Namely, if you look up 'gullible', it will insert your face-icon if one exists in the mail system.)<p>

Personally, I like to have the older words, since it's harder to get a definition for them.
