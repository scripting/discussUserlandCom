Build a site that lets a user ask for a word. Your site can cough up a word out of one of the public domain lists for which there isn't a definition yet. The user can then type in the definition (preferably paraphrasing some authoritative source) and after 500,000 hits, Voila!  a true GPL dictionary. Not some cheesy word list, but a real dictionary with definitions, pronounciations, etc.<p>

Hey, if 50,000 of the Scripting News readers volunteered to take a word a day, we'd be finished before Valentine's Day!
