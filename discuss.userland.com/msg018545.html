Each music collection is the starting point for a whole Web, with discussions, lyrics, pointers to other sites, more music, and who knows what. Each of these sites acts as a distributor, and why not put some money into the mix, flowing it back down the chain to the originating artists. His verbal testimony on Tuesday was not that clear, so I just spoke with him on the phone to verify that I understood the idea.

He speaks like a radio announcer, a little Rush Limbaugh-ish, and at first I was right there with him, then he started talking some VC-speak, and I had no idea what he was saying. Then it got even worse, he started trashing Napster. <br><br>	The MP3.Com guy did it right. Yes it must piss him off that Napster did what he didn't dare, and for now at least, is getting away with it, swamping his efforts to work with the music industry, and drawing all the attention his honorable efforts didn't. The difference is that eMusic's Hoffman took some cheap shots at Napster (don't remember what they were) and in doing this, he's making the same mistake that the music industry is making.<br><br>	As product and service developers, we all must understand the users' point of view, and be in harmony with it. If we lose Napster it's going to be bad, for eMusic too. There's a market developing here, understand the market, and be part of it, serve it. It must be tempting to focus too much energy on Napster, but don't let that get in the way of connecting with the users, Napster's too. <br><br>	(How many eMusic users also use Napster?)<br><br>	To his credit, Hoffman was concise and convincing in explaining the new technology. He travels with his entire music collection on a small hard drive.

He had no plan. That's half the story. Now, how long should the users wait? The users waited quite a long time. That's the other half of the story.<br><br>	I've thought about the questions some have asked about Frontier, and I have an answer. If a Napster-like system for software developed, and it included everyone else's software, you're damned right I would want Frontier included.<br><br>	In other words, if I were Ulrich, I'd set up a server at Exodus or AboveNet and load every Metallica song onto its hard disk. I'd put a copy of Napster on the machine, log on, and let the magic happen.<br><br><b>Business model for Salon<a name="businessModelForSalon">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/13#businessModelForSalon" title="Permanent link to 'Business model for Salon' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	As you know I've been thinking about future business models for high integrity Web publications like Salon.<br><br>	I'm intrigued, it's a puzzle, using Salon as a case study is helping me chart the next steps for UserLand.<br><br>	I see the Web as an integrated application, of people. We have writers, nerds and music lovers here at UserLand. Same at Salon, but in different quantity and proportion, with different focus.<br><br>	I see the Web playing an important supporting role in the evolution of music-on-the-Internet. In the Dr Dobbs interview (<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/13#interviewsPastPresentFuture">below</a>) I said that music is the next most compelling application, that we'll spend the rest of our careers exploring it, it's so big. <br><br>	How will the Web contribute? It's already doing it. For every song on Napster, there's a page you can find with Google that has the lyrics. The Web is pretty complete now, as Napster's database is. It's surprising that in the rage over MP3, we're overlooking that a couple of years ago it was considered controversial to share lyrics on the Web. <br><br>	But the Web can do more, and therein lies the business model. There's a new explosion in software tools and hardware coming, it's quite fluid right now, the emails I'm getting on new product teams forming to create portable players and software is incredible. I have trouble wrapping my mind around all this, but I totally love it. <i>Keep those ideas flowing.</i><br><br>	We need places to share our ideas openly, and we will have them, but we also need integrity and a good name to hang the new ideas on. As we discuss new products, we'll gather communities of people interested in those products, and when they're available, we'll buy them. Let's ask users to reconsider some premises about the freeness of software, as we debate the freeness of music. Why should software be free? Think about it. It probably shouldn't.<br><br>	We've really gummed up the feedback loop between users and developers, adding lots of mindless publicists, icons, lawyers, VCs, and then (lost somewhere in space) software developers. <i>We have the opportunity to collapse out all the middlemen.</i> Users and developers, connected, one and the same, money flows one way, joy flows the other. This is nirvana. <br><br>	Clearly, ultimately we're going to realize that we must always pay for our music, at the same time, let's reform the software industry in the other direction, let's have money flow to software artists as it does to musical artists. No more working for free, for software too. <br><br>	So where is the business model for a high integrity publication like Salon? First, they keep doing what they do so well, keeping their eyes and ears open for the next big thing, and they do something new, when something huge like music on the Internet comes along, start new publications, work with vendors (like Napster) to first organize their user community, forming a farm system, and take the best of what they produce and make it a centerpiece of the market. <br><br>	As money shows up in the market, sell the products to the users, with the necessary separation of publishing and editorial function. Latch onto <i>anything</i> with growth that is exciting. The bet is that the Internet will produce many of these rushes over the coming years, and that being in position to study and report on them is where the value is. <br><br>	I have more thinking and writing to do here.
