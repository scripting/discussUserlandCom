I was trying to email this message to you, but after looking around for your email addr, decided to post it here.  I am a teacher, and the main tech person at Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon. What follows is a copy of message that I sent to members of our tech team:<p>

Hi Lincoln Folks,<p>

I have been encouraging my computer students to create sites using the
technology offered at editthispage.com.  Dave Winer, the creator of this
software, and host of the site www.scripting.com, has a tour of the
sites that he reads.  One of the sites that he mentions in his tour is:<p>

<a href="http://cubanhistory.editthispage.com/">http://cubanhistory.editthispage.com/</a><p>

"Cuba for Students. This is a teacher's site, an excellent example of
Manila used in an educational setting. Great pictures of young Fidel
Castro. Read the stories linked to at the bottom of the page."<p>

Dave got it a little wrong, this site was created by one of our
students, Derek Jensen of the 6th period computer science class.  This
is a good example of the editthispage technology. Yes he gets an "A."
He is in Mrs. Bevington's Spanish class, I hope that she see's this. By the way, the articles linked to were written by students also.<p>

Also, Melinda Gale's 5th period spanish class has been working with
presentations some using Powerpoint, some with traditionial web pages,
and some using Editthispage!<p>

Dave's tour can be found at:  <a href="http://www.editthispage.com/daveTour">http://www.editthispage.com/daveTour</a><p>
