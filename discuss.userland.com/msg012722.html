We're moving www.scripting.com from WebSTAR to Apache. Most of the hierarchy is old stuff that's either been redirected or never changes. The only really fast-changing page on the site is the very top-level, default.html, the Scripting News home page.<p>

I'm almost done running the script that creates all the .htaccess files from the RAW files. Tested it out for a single directory, Apache seems happy, so I'm happy.<p>

Believe it or not we're doing it so that Nirvana will be happier and run more smoothly, and of course that means *I* will be happier and run more smoothly. ";->"
