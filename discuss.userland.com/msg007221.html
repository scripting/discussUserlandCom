You can't use NT Workstation as a web server, because Microsoft has crippled it by limiting the number of TCP/IP connections. That means NT Server. <p>

At insight.com the lowest price for NT was just under $700. You're paying more for your base OS than your hardware! Assuming your $15k is just for hardware, here's what it will really cost you:<p>

<pre>
  15 x ($1000 + $700) = $25,500
  30 x ($500  + $700) = $36,000
</pre><p>

What's the point of that? I mean, why buy cheap hardware when your software is so expensive?<p>

I think cobalt qubes or netwinders are by far a better choice. Of course, you can't run Frontier ;-(
