Any opportunities for mischief in this? JavaScript has been crippled a bit (inability to write to the hard disk, for example) to prevent many of the security risks present in ActiveX. Does adding "XML-RPC" support to a human-supporting browser open a door for unauthorized access to the file system or to data held in the browser's object model? <p>

Memories of a 1997 <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/">JavaOne</a> keynote by Scott McNealy. Miko demoed a web-downloaded ActiveX control called Internet Exploder developed by Fred McLean to show security holes. The control shut the computer down. Upon reboot, it formatted a floppy drive, found a user's install of Quicken, wrote a check. <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/keynotes/transcripts/Keynote_McNealy.html">the transcript</a>. I'm sure Microsoft closed most of those doors since; does this open a new one or can we rely upon the rest of the browser to protect the user?
