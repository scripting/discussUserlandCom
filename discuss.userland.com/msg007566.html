The error in logbrowser's inetd section is port = 81/stream = 1/whatWentWrong = Can't write stream because TCP/IP error code 10035 - Resource temporarily unavailable./whatWereWeDoing = Returning data). This happens from Netscape to Userland.com as well as my own F6-based dynamic websites. It appears to be a function of the overall time in loading the page. More than 30-40 seconds and bammo! you're out! Any progress on a fix? It's a bummer when you want to show off your Frontier based app. and you get a blank page. <p>
