hmm... i figure that you know i want to see the engine - the sublime underworkings - by now, as do many others.  and, of course, there are many who enjoy the "EditThisPage" button - the actualization - as well.<p>

perhaps truly *beautiful code* is that which allows the user to do both: becoming *what* the user wants from it, not the other way around. there's very little software that has such power, yet is packaged in such a way as to be so flexible.<p>
