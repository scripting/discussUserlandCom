Hmmm. I'm curious about what people out there are using refcons in outlines for. I've never played with them,
              but they look like an intriguing idea.
</i><p>

i've started using them in my todo lists and meeting notes. I attach filespecs to them while I'm listing things I need to do. Like an outline subheading:<p>

>Prepare art for job 509.09<p>

would have a refcon pointing to the file(s) I need. I use the custom menu to add them/ take action on them<p>

My only wish is that the outliner triangle would change color or something when there was a refcon attached.
