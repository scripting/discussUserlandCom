Actually XML-RPC started out as as a distributed objects protocol, but when we split off in 4/98, we took a subset and went with that first. Atkinson almost surely will want to add back the distributed objects. We'll call that XML-RPC 2.0. <p>

I think Allaire is doing the same thing. The WDDX they envision is far richer than the one they're promoting now. But giving a large number of developers a chance to get started with something that's a no-brainer works best. We're in agreement on that, I think, but we've chosen different starting points.<p>

Atkinson's spec is upward compatible with XML-RPC as it is currently spec'd. So there could be three flavors of HTTP-based distributed objects. I was hoping we could avoid that.
