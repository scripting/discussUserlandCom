Jakob's not auctioning <b>a</b> seat, Builder.com is (dutch) auctioning <b>all</b> the seats. It's an answer to the question, "How did they decide on <b>that</b> price???"<p>

The attendees will decide what it's worth to them to be 1 of 30 people who get to listen to Jakob for 8 hours. It's an interesting idea.
