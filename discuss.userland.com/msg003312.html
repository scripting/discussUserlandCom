What if a web browser was running with Frontier - at the same time - on a client machine?<p>

How would:<p>

   - real-time chat - as per the discussion thread here<p>

   - collaborative outlining - again as per this thread<p>

   - content management systems - general topic<p>

   - multimedia authoring - that's an area I've worked in for years<p>

   - Personal Portals, Portal tools, Knowledge Management, Intranets<p>


be different/better if we had Froniter running on the client side!<p>

Wow!  That's exciting to me!
