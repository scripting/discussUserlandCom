Asking Tim and Dale if I could speak was like asking Apple if I could speak at WWDC. Only Apple people speak there. (Been there, done that, got *lots* of t-shirts.)<p>

OTOH, Seybold has been much more open. A relatively quiet show, which the users run.<p>

Now what really spells doom for the Open Source guys is that they don't have very many users. So, can any new ideas permeate? How?<p>

No matter. The Next Big Thing is already <a href="http://www.napster.com/">here</a>. Of course when you're inside the firewall, listening to all the internal chatter, you can't see that. It happened at IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Sun, Netscape. A steady progression of smoking hulks. This is one of the least interesting smoking hulks I've ever seen. Routed around. One Infinite Loop.<p>

I like to live outside, after Apple I'm never going to be a captive developer again. And there is (imho) the reason why they don't want me to speak. Because I would tell them that there's a big world outside. Take off the parachute, jump, and let's dance. You don't have all the answers. Same message to Microsoft, which heard it a lot better.
