Polite bots can be blocked using a <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/robots/robots-txt.html">ROBOTS.TXT</a> file.  Since your average search engine is a polite bot, you should be aware that if you are not careful, this will prevent your site from being indexed, generally considered a bad thing.<p>

<I>What software is available to "scrape" web pages?</I><p>

If you can imagine it, it's probably available, from several sources.<p>

You'll need to be more specific.  Software that grabs data and does something with it?  Software that can include a piece of several pages into one?  Sites that frame your site?  All of these exist, and they require different actions to block.
