I was very disappointed when I discovered that I couldn't use Emacs as my login shell. :-)<p>

<i>With Frontier running I can tie XML-RPC to arbitrary scripts that run the Mac OS? Windows?</i><p>

Yes. If we had XML-RPC for Emacs, you could write elisp scripts which talked to Frontier on your Macintosh and controlled the whole system via UserTalk or AppleScript. With a bit of hacking, you could even use Emacs to flow content into QuarkXPress.<p>

<i>There's this fantasy world where all apps can talk to each other via a uniform layer and the user can program how they act.</i><p>

In my fantasy world, anybody who could write a script could also figure out how to make XML-RPC calls from Windows to Linux to the MacOS.<p>

There's no reason user scripts should be stuck on one machine. We want to build these bridges and make them strong.<p>
