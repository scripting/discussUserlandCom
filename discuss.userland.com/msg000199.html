It seems both simple and elegant at first glance.<p>

Question. Is there a way to actually run it on my machine so I can play around with some ideas? I downloaded the discussiongroup.root file and opened it as a guest database. Looking at the URL used to access it on Nirvana it doesn't seem like either a regular .wsf (requiring an entry in ...data.doctree) or a .fcgi<p>

I may just be overlooking the obvious, but how does Frontier dispatch a URL like <a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/discussiongroup.root/newMsg$171">http://nirvana.userland.com/discussiongroup.root/newMsg$171</a> and why won't it fo it for me?<p>

Perhaps I need the new responder. Any info would be appreciated. Great work!
