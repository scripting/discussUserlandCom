The message that Microsoft hears: "We have no say in what you do, so we thought we'd show you many of us there are."<p>

The only way to make a difference is to build your own browser. The message would be better aimed at the Mozilla crowd. An even better message. "Here's $10 million to hire the best programmers to make Mozilla shine."<p>

I'm amazed that Yahoo, eBay and Lycos haven't put together a browser programming fund to make sure that there's always an alternative to Microsoft's browser. That would be powerful. (Or Oracle, HP, Sun, Apple, etc. Or the DOJ.)<p>

Aiming petitions at Microsoft is like pissing into the wind. It only raises the question of why such a petition is necessary. Why? Because Microsoft has all the power, at least when it comes to web standards.<p>

One (humble) man's opinion.
