Corporations in their current form will not survive the next century, and while Cluetrain may not effect the change itself, it serves as an excellent focal point for the burgeoning anti-corporate sentiments.  I've found myself thinking "If only companies (and countries) would stop acting like Marvel comic book villain-gods (Galacticus, anyone?), the whole WTO Seattle scene wouldn't be necessary -- everyone who actually *works* for the entities represented there would hear the complaints and be able to take action on them.  Why aren't they on the cluetrain?"  This site was the antidote to America On-Time before it even happened.  If AOL-TW ever gets on the cluetrain, there may be no stopping it.  If it doesn't, it's going to die a horrible death in, oh, say, thirty years.  When it falls, it will land on the economy of the western world at that time.<p>

About ebay I can only say: when the ebay meme goes global, look out.
