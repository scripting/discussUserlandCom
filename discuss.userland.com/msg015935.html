It had been a long time since we had met. I'm glad we did. Of course we went to Jing Jing and had Spicy Noodles. I want to see if we can work with the Web Standards Project, which Glenn is part of. Maybe we could all eat Spicy Noodles together.</i><p>

Actually, while Glenn is a co-founder of <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">WSP</a>, he resigned from the <a href="http://webstandards.org/members.html">Steering Committee</a> a few months back so that he could have time to work on other projects.<p>

Speaking as an SC member, though, I can say that we'd be happy to work with you (and anyone) on improving the browsers and tools to support the W3C standards.<p>
