We're having a discussion in the Frontier community about the connection between search engines and content management systems.<p>

We'd love to see a powerful search engine that ties directly into our content management system. This way we could keep their index updated in real time, and furthermore, we could factor out the template information, providing them a flow of <i>content.</i><p>

<b>Manila has a slot for this</b><p>

Here's a screen shot of the prefs panel in each Manila site where the search engine server is specified:<p>

I've suggested this before, but it's worth mentioning again, because Manila is about to ship, and at that point, there will be an opportunity for SEs to hook directly into the CMS thru an open interface.
