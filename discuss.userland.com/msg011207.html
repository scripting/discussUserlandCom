<a href="http://www.lists.ic.ac.uk/hypermail/xml-dev/xml-dev-Sep-1999/0878.html">Tim Bray</a>: "I am building this big hairy complicated app in which a web server traverses an extremely complex database, extracts some dense information structures, sends them to a client, and the client does some nifty rendition tricks."<p>

<a href="http://screenshots.userland.com/pictures/mjg@oms.com/perl.jpg">Mark Gardner</a> has Frontier/Win calling Perl, and Perl calls back. <i>Nice!</i><p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11232">Here's evidence</a> of *lots* of working together. Scott Sweeney has an XSL renderer for Scripting News, based on our XMLization. It does the rendering in the web browser, IE5. It makes me dizzy. <i>It also makes me laugh!</i><p>

<a href="http://edgar.space.invisible.net/">What is</a> EdgarSpace? I have no idea.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11247">Tucker Goodrich</a>: "EDGAR Documents are the filings made to the Security and Exchange Commission by publicly-owned companies. Annual reports, quarterly reports, that sort of thing. I live in these things all day long."<p>

<a href="http://mappa.mundi.net/rocket/strom_report.html">Danny Goodman</a>, who is well-known in the scripting world, built an application that explores the Invisible Worlds database from JavaScript in the browser.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11214">This is so frustrating</a>! They talk and talk about their XML, but where is it?? Remember Dr. Strangelove. What did he say. What's the point of having the Doomsday Device if you don't tell people about it. What's the point of being XML if you don't share it? Hello.<p>

OK, they have DTDs for <a href="http://mappa.mundi.net/rocket/space.cgi/dtds/edgarspace.dtd.html">EDGAR</a> and <a href="http://mappa.mundi.net/rocket/space.cgi/dtds/rfcspace.dtd.html">RFCs</a>. Where are the actual files? URLs?<p>

BTW, the <a href="http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/frame2/articles/borg/kahn.html">Doomsday Device</a> in Dr. Strangelove was not a joke, or it was a very good one, depending on how you look at it.<p>

PC WEEK: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,2329627,00.html">The scoop on web content management</a>. "Web content management products will still have something to offer, especially in workflow, where many document management tools and other products come up short. But businesses looking at Web content management should take a long, hard look down the road before opening their wallets for a product available today."<p>

I've been spending more time with the Profiles site. From time to time I'm going to point to ones I find interesting. For example, surprisingly, <a href="http://profiles.userland.com/$neogeek@yahoo.com">Kilgore Trout</a>, a recurring character in Kurt Vonnegut novels, is a UserLand.Com member, as is <a href="http://profiles.userland.com/$dhopkins@maxis.com">Don Hopkins</a>.<p>

Red Herring: <a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/1999/0916/vc-fool.html">Is Motley Fool a Wise Investment</a>?<p>

PS: Yesterday I finally got in touch with the webmaster at Red Herring and they're going to send me the URL of their RSS file in a couple of days. They want to do a special one just for us. This is fairly frustrating. Whatever.<p>

<a href="http://news.userland.com/profiles/$markk@fool.com">The Motley Fool</a> has contributed content to My.UserLand.Com since Day One without conditions. <i>They are our friends.</i>
