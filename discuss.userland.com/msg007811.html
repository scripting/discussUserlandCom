"I've spoken many times in the past about the importance of Steve Jobs' role in the Apple computers. But I was the inventor and engineer, solely. Remember, the Apple I was the first small computer ever with a keyboard standard, and the Apple II had the first color graphics, the first hi-res graphics, the first BASIC in ROM, the first sound and paddles for games, and a host of very clever approaches. Plus, it was so understandable and versatile and usable that it inspired tons of people. I hear from these people all the time, everywhere I go." <i>Right on. I fell in love with the Apple II, it was great because it had memory mapped video. It was so fast and so easy to program the UI. This was totally revolutionary for me at the time. Thanks Woz!</i><p>

I'm dreaming again about being freed from the experts." <i>A clue for Stew, who's a VC now. Invest in software developers.</i><p>
