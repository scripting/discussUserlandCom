Yeah, sure I'm a geek and geeky things like this excite me, ok?<p>

Some questions:<p>

Will there be a way for other apps to display outline-like elements?
Will there be a way to apply transformations on your xml data?  For instance I want to edit something like an outline, but then switch to an html view, and even test it out with a canned SVG view.  If there was a way to apply xslt on the xml data, where the xsl stylesheet lived on the server too (sharable xslt files might replace manila themes :] ) .<p>


Can this really be two-way? Say I store some xml data on mystoragespace.com, but then I want manila's service to pull it, view it as an outline, edit it, then push it back to the site... (ala, blogger).<p>

<p>

Gee, how can I be asking questions about something I know virtually nothing about yet?  heh.<p>

I'm watching this stuff though, with an eye to hooking mozilla right up into it.  Mozilla or whatever browser isnt needed though, since I imagine I could have a WAP transformer, or just a plain vanilla html view with input fields.
