The question is --<p>

"Is this effort value-added for Userland-and-community or just pleasant white noise?"<p>

I have <i>nil</i> ego wrapped up in this project. While it could yield me a free Frontier license, I can easily purchase Frontier through a non-profit I work with (and would indeed use it for non-profit work) and can justify reg license subsequently when a biz project stipulates it.<p>

My thought has been that a dynamic, evolving, hypertext white paper for prospective users and technical media could collect together a range of materials that might otherwise be too frustrating for an individual to find/explore. .Pdf version will also be generated.<p>

I'd guess I'm about 50% complete with a first, usable version. The theory (or, at least, mine) is that the paper would be staged to a Userland subsite once done and updated periodically.<p>

Thumbs up? Down? Suggestions for improving?<p>

Silence will suggest lack of usefulness, no? ;-)<p>
