Well, they are certainly sufficient for a wide catagory of problems.  The classic benefits of distributed systems are transparent management of network resources.  If all the disk drives in an office are treated as a pool, you get some easy RAID-style redundancy and fault tollerance.  It shouldn't really matter in this day and age if your hard disk dies or not.  You should still be able to boot and get to your work.  It isn't that big a change in technology from the current PC network ... just little bit of code to support network booting and a little bit of code to support a distributed filesystem.  The problem is how to get the technology into a Windows world.<p>

If you believe in the distrubted solution, you have to find a way to get it in play.  That Jini is targeted the way it is may be less political than simply strategic:  Which is easier, to get everybody to throw over Windows for a distributed OS, or to slide a little distributed technology into those markets which will accept it?
