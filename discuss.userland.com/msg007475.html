Perhaps either force people to specify a <timezone>, or use SkipGMTHours, SkipGMTDays, to remind them that silicon valley isn't the only place on the net <0.6 wink>?<p>

* I'm new to the scene, but it seems like there's already a lot of fragmentation in the standards. Perhaps it should be 'extended rss' or the like - it's hard enough getting content providers to produce one file...<p>

* I agree very much that some of the syntax is cumbersome. More attributes on tags! Also, the contact fields' (webmaster, etc) format
is a bit vague; what's allowable as an e-mail address? Why not have the contact's name as the payload of the tag, and the actual e-mail address as an attribute?<p>

* associating a date with each item would be very nice. HTTP-date? Unix epoch? dunno.<p>

* There can be many formats for an item; you've done the 'free-flow text' type. Wouldn't it be nice to support this as well as the stock 'headline / link ' and a better 'headline / link / description ' format as well? Or does it?<p>

Keep up the good work...
