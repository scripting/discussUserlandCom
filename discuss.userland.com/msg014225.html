Actually, it's because I finally took on a Frontier-related project that could pay for it. But, that said, the speedup on ETP is great, especially noticeable from work, where we're on a T3 connection. And that speedup will make it a lot easier to sell F6.x-based projects.<p>

Will Userland share with developers at some point what and where the bottleneck was?<p>
