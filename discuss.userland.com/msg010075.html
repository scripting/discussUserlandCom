A few weeks ago, I was having a problem with a new internet service provider.  They provide basic help docs on their web site.  I was trying to get PHP working.  I sent them an email explaining that my file 'test.php3' was not being parsed and the server was sending the file as if downloading.  I got back a cut-and-paste paragraph right out of their help system stating that to use PHP, your file must have an extension of '.php3'!<p>

After multiple phone calls (on hold, over and over again, "Most answers can be found on our web site...") I was finally able to convince a human that the server was misconfigured.<p>

I have found that I can get past the droids by using lots of technical terms, "Could you check the srm.conf file and see if PHP is enabled?" "Er, just a second, I'll get my supervisor".
