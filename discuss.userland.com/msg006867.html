1) When running a browser on the same machine as the Frontier server, Frontier performs less well than if you visit your site from another machine.<p>

2) Frontier is best at serving dynamic pages, less good at serving images. If can serve your images from a server like IIS or WebSTAR or Apache that's good at serving that kind of content, then it's a good idea. Otherwise, I'm not sure it matters if the image is in the file system or in the odb, but you might want to try both to see which is faster on your system.
