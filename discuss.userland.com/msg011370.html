Random groupware/reputation thought of the minute.  I've been trolling through the search engine looking for answers to mainresponder questions.  (And found my answers!) I'd like to tag/rate/promote the DG articles that I found useful.  Sort of along the line of "this posting answered a question" or "this is really insightful". <p>

Perhaps as a POST to clueserver.userland.com?  <p>
