The total words will be somewhere around 800,000,000 Chinese characters. And since Chinese charc. is 2-byte, that means they have about 1,600,000,000 ascii charc. The problem that I have is that I constantly ran out of memory when I tried to index the site. I have set the memory allocation to around 50Mb (I use a Mac), but I have never gotten it to index more than 2,000,000 Chinese characters. I checked my codes very carefully, and I didn't find anything that would caused the memory leak. So, I decided to run a test on the built-in "English" indexer on a large site (I wrote a script to translate some of the Chinese pages into some meaningless English pages). Then I found that even the built-in indexer has the same problem when indexing an extreme large site.<p>

Any help?
