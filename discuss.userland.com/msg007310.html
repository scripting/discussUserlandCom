I have found that most of the time following the instructions works well, and when I have had difficulty the response from Andre and others on the mailing list has been great. There is no doubt that the complexity of Frontier has exploded and I'm immensely reassured that the whole thing is not just in one head, but 30 or 40!<p>

It is always difficult to transfer knowledge from one head to another without the intervention of some media or another, so let me pose just one question for now:<p>

How does an HTTP request get handled by Frontier (a) when it is running behind a webserver such as Webstar (say with the Nirvana plug-in) and (b) when Frontier itself is the server. It would be really useful to have a map or description of how Frontier handles the call from the lowest level through to sending back a response.
