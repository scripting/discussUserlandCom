I'd love to hear more from Josh Allen and David McCusker, the questions they're talking about are totally new territory, so for it to be a learning experience for all, I ask them to step back about 20 percent, take a deep breath, and self-edit.<p>

David, you are saying some things that you don't know. Josh cares about the company he works for, and he shouldn't have to respond to such things. <p>

It's possible that we can create some new bridges here too. I know a lot of Microsoft people, and even more ex-Microsoft people. It's not as simple as you say it is.<p>

Continue the debate if you want, but it's borderline flame stuff.
