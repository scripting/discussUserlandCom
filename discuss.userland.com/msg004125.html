I'm going to read this many times! Further, I'd like to stress the synergies not the overlap. I'd like to have a way to deploy Frontier-managed sites in a Zope environment. I think this is the win-win, and I think it's good long-term as well. I'm going to point to this from SN, I hope everyone on the planet that cares about this stuff reads it. Thanks again.
