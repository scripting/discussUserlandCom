"Later products added major features, such as virtual storage, rules-based formatting, more complete presentation features, and multi-line headlines. But what was added in richness was traded against some of the simplicity of 1.1c, which many people remember as being more complete than it actually was (I certainly am guilty of that!)." <i>1987, Mac.</i><p>
