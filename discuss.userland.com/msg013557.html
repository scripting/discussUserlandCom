Just to be clear: I consider an email reader and a news client to be unnecessary bells & whistles in a browser. And based on StatMarket surveys, so do over 80% of other surfers.<p>

I also think that the calendar and editor parts are unecessary fluff that could have been cut to improve your time to market. And according to <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/shared/printable_articles/0,1440,14023,00.html">that same PC World article</a>, Communicator 5 will also include built-in instant messaging, voice over IP, travel information, and news headlines. That's a lot of other things being added while claiming that the delay is solely due to implementing standards & quality.<p>

Personally, I only changed over to IE fairly recently when it became clear that Netscape wasn't going to ship a 4.5 version of Navigator (vs. Communicator). I wanted the best browser, and Netscape was clearly saying that they were going to put their effort into things other than browsing. When y'all ship a <b>browser</b>, that's when I'll seriously consider making it my primary again.
