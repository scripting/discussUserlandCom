The <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3043">last time</a> I installed their software it reset system prefs that broke Windows. It inserted itself in places where it was not given permission. Major privacy issues.<br><br>On the other hand, it's been a long time since the last release, and this browser is built using new technology, and if AOL has screwed with its policies there may be a way around them since Mozilla is open source. <br><br>BTW, I <i>want</i> to hear good news about this browser. Let's hope for the best and focus on the bright spots. And show extreme gratitude for the bleeding-edge guys and gals who are willing to go first here.

First, I'm glad he's reading our site now, perhaps he'll learn what we do at UserLand. That would be awesome. Second, under no circumstance may a vendor exert pressure on us relative to editorial content on our sites. This is an invasion of our integrity and will not be tolerated. We do not allow customers to try to influence what we say, nor will we allow vendors. <br><br>3/30/00: <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$510">UserLand as a publisher</a>.<br><br>One of my highest priorities is to write a simple integrity statement for UserLand so I can refer people to it. I also want to get an advisory board in place, of people with a strong understanding of editorial integrity to review our practices. Without such a clear statement and oversight, I'll have to waste a lot of energy writing one-off statements to people who challenge our integrity.<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/financial/05cnd-clinton-econ.html"><img src="../misc/snImages/billAndBill.gif" height="74" width="94" border="0"></a><br><br>
