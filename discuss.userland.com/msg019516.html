I don't believe they stand for those things at all. In case you missed it, a gay person spoke at the Convention last week, lots of minorities were attendees and a few as speakers. It seems to me that you are one of those with a closed mind. :-)<p>

I'm pretty sure Bush will get elected, so my question is where will you go? Are you leaving before the end of the year? Have a good trip!<p>
