Years ago, the Everyware Development company had Butler on the Mac, but it was too buggy to depend upon. It has been off the market for years anyway.<p>

Nowadays so many resources available on the Internet are cross-platform. But access to an SQL database for a Mac user just for learning purposes is a costly endeavor.<p>

Has anyone heard or considered putting a training SQL database online? This database would only need three tables and not many columns and records (let's say 5).<p>

The idea would be that it could be accessed via scripting languages, C, C++, Java, etc. Then folks could extend and expand their knowledge by programming against this database sample.<p>

I'm surprised that the leading database companies have not considered this as a way to promote familiarity with their products.<p>

Is this idea valid or unrealistic?<p>

TIA
