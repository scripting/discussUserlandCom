On the Mac at least, running Python in Frontier would be possible by implementing Python as an OSA dialect, as has already been done (to some extent or other) with <A HREF="http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/JavaScriptOSA/">JavaScript</A>, <A HREF="http://www.louch.com/">Tcl</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~neeri/macintosh/perl.html">Perl</A>.  Then just pick Python from the pop-up menu at the bottom of a script window. Ta da.<p>

As an either/or thing, it makes sense.  As I've been working back and forth with UserTalk and Python (and Java, Lisp/Scheme, and Objective-C) over the last few months, about the only issues I ever have are typing ":" at the end of an if statement and expecting Frontier to auto-indent. :-)<p>

However, trying to create a language hybrid as a UserTalk "replacement" doesn't make much sense to me.  The languages, while sharing a certain amount in syntax, are fundamentally incompatible in several ways.  The only way I could think to map Python objects would be to tables in Frontier.  The content of the table would be the equivalent of obj.__dict__, and you'd need some way of storing references to methods, but even then, there'd be a lot of typing issues that aren't easily solved.<p>
