...I've been somewhat amused by the whole "liquid HTML" discussion I keep running into on weblogs, part of me thinking "welcome back to the *point*", but I can usually emphathize with the sites that are pushing the design limits of HTML.<p>

So I'm curious as to if there's a design goal in publishing the news stories with that really wide table width? I haven't been able to find any references to it (but then, this has been a time of High Chaos, and I may have missed something...)<p>

(Loved today's DaveNet, even if I had to scroll sideways :-)
