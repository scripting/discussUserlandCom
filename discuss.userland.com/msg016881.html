You attach a scanner or digital copier to the Axis and then you can use protocols like SMTP, FTP or HTTP to scan pictures.<p>

The Axis 700 is <A HREF="http://www.cdw.com/shop/products/default.asp?EDC=115831">$1,329 at CDW</A>. The <A HREF="http://www.axis.com/products/axis_7000/features.html">new 7000 model</A> with more RAM, new processor, 100baseT and 10baseT support is $1,569. From the list of supported devices, you probably can get an HP printer for about $399 (Hewlett Packard ScanJet 6300Cse, not sure if the "se" model is exact match to the support models list)<p>

One other observation, I wonder if the lack of GIF support is due to Unisys' patent?
