His concern was that students can view the cookies of other students in the event that a student doesn't log-off after using a computer in the computer lab. Encrypting the cookie, even if it was nothing more that using base64, would make it harder to remember than a cookie in just the plain text. Most of the people who use this discussion group could easily figure that one out, but for the non-technical users which constitute the majority in many real-world situations, some encoding of cookies would be nice. Or, there should be a easy way to toggle for using cookies or using http authentication with a modal dialog.
