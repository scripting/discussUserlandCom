Excellent! I'm going to help them. Earlier this week I met with Mike Homer, the former VP-Marketing at Netscape. We talked about a lot of things, including what was going on at NS. The more I learn the more I want there to be another browser. Esp after talking with Joel Klein earlier this month. <p>

There's always stuff to learn as the dust settles. Also talking with Andrew made a big difference. I think now Netscape, or what remains of it, very much wants our support. So let's keep an open mind and a friendly atmosphere and we may all get what we want.<p>

Even Microsoft, which presumably wants to be allowed to innovate, on their own terms.
