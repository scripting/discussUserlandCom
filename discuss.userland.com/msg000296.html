I'm really hyped-up about the idea of using DW for template design and then having Frontier import and fill with data. It's particularly cool because DW 2.0 has a feature where you can "lock" some users out of editing certain parts of the document. So, an imagined scenario is this:<p>

1. Coder develops initial template for a page and tags certain areas with things like <copy> and <product shot>.<p>

2. Coder passes DW page to copywriter and artist, who fill in the appropriate areas. Coder worries not, because copywriter and artist are using WYSIWYG tool which can't destroy HTML. Pages are 'proofed' by posting them to an area where the client reviews.<p>

3. Whoops! Client freaks, and changes the design. Coder worries not because she can take the <copy> and <product shot> info from the template into Frontier, then readjust the template, then push all the pages back out again.<p>

4. Everybody lives happily ever after.<p>

Seems like a fine use of XML in production.<p>

Comments?<p>
