<i>Sun and Inprise took their code, cleaned it up and added some functionality and then released it as their own, without any mention of the Blackdown project.</i><p>

Yeah, that wasn't the best PR move of the week. Sun's been really unhelpful towards the Blackdown folks all along, even while the Blackdown folks were working like dogs to make Java support SMP under Linux.<p>

As soon as Linux became trendy, Sun took all the Blackdown work, wrote up a press release thumping their own chest, and didn't even bother to bring the Blackdown team into the loop. The SCSL allows them to do this, and the Blackdown team can't do anything but smile and nod.<p>

Sun could have avoided all this nonsense with a few phone calls and another paragraph in the press release. As it is, they're making hasty public apologies and trying to salvage some sort of relationship with Blackdown.<p>

Open source developers are just like any other developers. If they do you a big favor, and you don't thank them, they won't do you any more favors. This isn't exactly rocket science.<p>

Cheers,<br>
