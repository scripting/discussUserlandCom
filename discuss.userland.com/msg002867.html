Then there's the descriptive information about the entry. Which, as Jorn points out, is the hard part since some news pages/web logs are highly free form.<p>

Can we get some value right away by agreeing to standards for metadata and wrap free-form HTML description/comment data in an element mapped to the HTML namespace?
