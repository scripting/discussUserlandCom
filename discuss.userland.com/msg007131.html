Your second point interests me tho'. Why wouldn't I put an XML-RPC call in a web page? If that call returns something to the browser that it can render am I not using XML-RPC as a kind of "high(er) level URI for a cgi script"? This then is a kind of distributed object system no?<p>

Then, if I (as a server owner) publish an RPC call that returns all the public callable RPC interfaces on my machine haven't I just provided a resource for web site builders to integrate my server applications into their pages? Or am I just missing it?
