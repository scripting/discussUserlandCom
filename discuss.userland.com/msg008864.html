<i>After updating MR, I'm getting that 'refresh every second' behaviour again: I know someone answered this before - but I can't find that message.<p>

As far as I can see, nothing's changed in my user.scheduler or user.log tables. Have I overwritten a preference setting during the update?</i><p>

What I tracked down:<p>

That every second update was the user.cbetty.outgoing queue being polled. I just cleared out user.betty.outgoing.table (which was a list of indexing errors) and all is well.<p>

Still no indexing happening yet, though!
