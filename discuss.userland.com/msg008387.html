This and many news about BeOS and Linux's heading towards into cheap PC lead me into thinking that Microsoft's real threat is not from anyone outside, but from themselves. I was looking for a new PC for my first Linux last week and it turned out that, even if I don't like Windows 98 (or in some cases, NT), I can't take it out from most vendor's bundle. The real problem of this is, the OS is actually costing me $90+. It's not a big number to me. Being a computer users who have bought many boxes before, I understand that this is not a significant amount for what it adds to my system. But for people who are looking for a sub $500 PC, and for computer makers who are making these cheap PC, that $90+ is a big obstacle. It takes up 1/5 of the price tag of the machine!
