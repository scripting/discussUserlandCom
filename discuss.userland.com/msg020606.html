Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this, even though it is of only tenuous relevance to the site. I only decided to read the post because I happen to be interested in the history of religion (christian/judaism/islam) and like to read the various philosophical or theological arguments that have taken place over the centuries (not forgetting either the brutality or charity).<p>

Well, I'm glad I read it because I have a tape (made off the radio show Coldcut used to have in the UK) containing a 'sunrise ... sunset ...' refrain that I now realise must be from 'Fiddler' (Coldcut were very eclectic!).<p>

The only thing I'd take issue with, being an atheist, is the 'chosen people' bit but the jews are not the only ones who believe that type of thing!<p>

All the best and ... Best Wishes!<p>
