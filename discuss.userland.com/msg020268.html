It really doesn't matter how much you pit your rhetoric against the FSFs or how much you complain that Napster steals from you. Its happening. There is no way to turn back the clocks.<p>

Since the Napster/GPL meteor has already hit, I'd guess that you are far better growing a furry coat and learning to thrive in the new environment than you are attempting to retain your dinosaur habits</em><p>

This sounds like all the arguments I heard about there being a New Economy that didn't follow the same rules as the Old Economy. Those arguments stopped when the market dropped. Eventually more music will be protected in such a way that  inconveniences those who pay for stuff, keeping the "honest" people honest, as they say. Those who want free music will get all the market-driven and promoted pop and back-catalog material they can stomach.<p>

I do both music and software, and I think Napster is both a useful tool that can add new dimensions to the music experience of listeners who bought music, <b>and</b> a vehicle of theft for those who are listening to music to which they were not granted license.
