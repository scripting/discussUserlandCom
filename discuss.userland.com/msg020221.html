This is a nice sentiment, but I wonder if it includes non-technology stuff? Surely your "ancestors in virtual slavery in Europe" didn't have technology freedom *primarily* in mind? (Even if they would extend their views to include technology.)<p>

There's been lots of political repression in this country recently. I've written extensively about it in Philadelphia at <a href="http://monkeyfist.com/RNC-Philly">Monkeyfist</a>. Dru Jay, of <a href="http://misnomer.editthispage.com/">Misnomer</a> fame, was in Philly with me, and <a href="http://monkeyfist.com/RNC_Photos">he took pictures</a> of the kind of political repression that we both witnessed directly.<p>

In addition, for all of us who make a living with technology, the ways it's being used to *foster* political repression are really scary, and something we should, in my view, pay more attention to. The Feds have admitted to lots of Web site/mailing list monitoring, to say nothing of all the "smart weapons" technology that are non-lethal, which only makes them more often used.<p>

The Web community, especially those of us who are our own publishers, has a responsibility to talk about *all* kinds of political repression, if, that is, we want to be taken seriously when we talk about technology-related kinds.<p>
