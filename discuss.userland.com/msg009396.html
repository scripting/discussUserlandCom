Two basic issues are at stake:  
<UL><LI>Can the right to control links to your site be reserved? (i.e., does such a right even exist?)</LI>
<LI>Is the right reserved by the company in question?</LI></UL><p>

The case of the company that believes that it can't be reserved and doesn't try is probably never found, because they'll simply never mention it.  However, you can find the other three combinations.<p>

<UL><LI>The right is reservable</LI>
<LI>The right is reserved.</LI></UL><p>

is explefied in the LaSalle example.<p>

<UL><LI>The right is reservable.</LI>
<LI>We don't reserve it.</LI></UL><p>

can be found in <A HREF="http://www.igat.com/isg/note.html"><a href="http://www.igat.com/isg/note.html">http://www.igat.com/isg/note.html</a></A>.   <I>"Inspirator Group has adapted an 'assumed consent' link policy..."</I> but it clearly implies it does not have to.<p>

And finally, the somewhat entertaining<p>

<UL><LI>We can't reserve the right...</LI>
<LI>but we'll try to use it anyhow.</LI></UL><p>

can be found at <A HREF="http://www.asahq.org/Policy/LinkPolicy.html"><a href="http://www.asahq.org/Policy/LinkPolicy.html">http://www.asahq.org/Policy/LinkPolicy.html</a></A>.  <I>"In such a case, ASA will attempt to have the link removed."</I> where "such a case" is if the links are <I>"...inappropriate or contrary to ASA's stated purpose and mission."</I><p>

No unity whatsoever on any level of the issue.  I found these really quickly on Infoseek with a <A HREF="http://infoseek.go.com/Titles?col=WW&qt=terms+conditions+service+%7C+link*&sv=IS&lk=noframes&cc=WW&oq=%22terms%22">search</A> of "terms conditions service | link*".<p>

Of course, you realize that by providing these links, I am stating my position on the issue of banning the links. :-)
