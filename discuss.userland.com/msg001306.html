I'm not very familiar with KDE. I took a look at a few months ago, but I like WindowMaker too much to switch. If I remember correctly, KDE has a Startup Folder on the desktop that works just like the Macs Startup Items folder. Anything you put in there will start up with X. I'll bet you have 2 copies of kscd in there. If you do, throw them in the trash. I believe that <a href="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</a> has documentation that could help you understand the environment better.<p>

As for the error message, Linux is intially setup so that only root has access to most of the stuff in the /dev directory. If you ever wanted to use the CD-ROM with any user other than root you'd have to change the file permissions for /dev/cdrom.<p>

Linux does take some getting use to. When I started using Linux I thought all the window managers sucked, so I initially did everything from the command line. I thinked that help me learn things a lot faster. The GUIs are just not as easy to use as they are with the Mac or Windows, so you spend too much time trying to figure out how to do things like you would on those systems. But once you know the command line pretty well, X-Windows gets a little clearer. Just an idea.
