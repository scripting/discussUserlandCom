The way WebX handles this is to give the user short time period (say 30 minutes) after posting during which she can edit the message. After that period, the edit button is no longer available. OTOH, there's also a delete button so the user can eliminate her message at any time. Maybe you just erase the contents of the message for threading purposes, but...
