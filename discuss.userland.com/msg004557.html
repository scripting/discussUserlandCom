I'm assuming that changes will be made almost continually, at least during some time intervals, so that manual refreshing would be too distracting, too much of a constant interruption. I don't have any experience with how a technography meeting actually runs, though, so maybe that's a bad assumption. Either way, "voice push" as you describe would certainly allow us to create a simple proof-of-concept implementation.<p>

As you suggested a few days ago, holding an actual technography meeting to make this all more concrete seems crucial. Without my own experience, I'm looking to Bernie's experience for guidance.<p>
