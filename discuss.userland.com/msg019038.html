Being in need of a client, but without much time on my hands, I just downloaded Pike, opened the database in frontier, and added a few menu items to connect to my server.<p>

The experiment worked beautifully.<p>

My question is this: will Pike (whatever it ends up being named) be released as a platform for third party developers? Frontier is such a great platform, but I need a compelling reason to devlop for it... distribution would be that reason.<p>

(keep in mind that I'm not considering the business impact on UserLand... i'm probably overlooking all sorts of things.)
