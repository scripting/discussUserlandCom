This is the smartest DG message ever. <p>

Every story I write is about me, and same for you and everyone else.<p>

The most confused messages are the ones that say you, you, you.<p>

They're all complete lies. There is no you. There is only me.<p>

A great Kurt Vonnegut book had this as one of the peripheral themes. A robot explains to Kilgore Trout that he's the only real person, everyone else is a robot sent to Earth to test him.<p>

Only on Very Good Days is there a window to spot other life forms roaming the planet.<p>

Maybe that's what death is about, erasing the illusion that there's anything but me.
