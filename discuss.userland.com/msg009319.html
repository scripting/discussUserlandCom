(incidentally i think $180m for icq was a bargain price cf. hotmail for example)...<p>

i’m not a software whizz but it doesn’t appear to me to be an unreasonable task to 1) encrypt both icq and aol protocols and 2) get the two to talk to each other, while at the same time supporting previous formats while ppl get round to upgrading their system... (or not as the case may be... i’m still running the first version of icq on my win3.1 486/50 clunker)... with aolim and icq talking to each other, microsoft would perhaps have to go back to the drawing board, such would be the penetration of the merged system...<p>

meanwhile, has anybody raised any security issues relating to odigo?... because it follows where you go does this not present the same problem that the ‘what’s related?’ feature on netscape raised a while back... <p>

(footnote: typing this up on word, the spellchecker suggests i use a capital ‘m’ in ‘microsoft’... no such suggestion for netscape... and spellchecker isn’t in the dictionary either!)...
