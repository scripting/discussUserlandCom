Creating the layer of abstraction there makes it easy for people to customize the browser, and makes it easy for Mozilla to maintain a common code base across platforms.  They can allow their internal UI designers to work in XUL instead of mucking around in the platform-specific code for each platform that Mozilla will run on.  <p>

The fact that it will enable users to create custom "skins" for the browser is just a side effect of the new design of Mozilla.  I imagine you'll be able to turn off the ability of Web sites to modify the look and feel of your browser; if Netscape doesn't give us that ability, someone will take the Mozilla source and create a hack that will enable us to do so.  <p>

I'm looking forward to being able to quickly and easily get rid of all of the crap on the browser interface that I don't use, or wire that stuff to functionality that I do use.
