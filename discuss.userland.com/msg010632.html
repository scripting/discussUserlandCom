Yes that is correct - OE has no COM components. It is not possible for Dave's wish to come true for OE.<p>

Of course, if he switches to Outlook (which will read his OE mailboxes), it will then be possible. I don't know how, I only figured out how to script a message through OE last year playing around, I never figured out how to read a message off the server.<p>

I'm user the people on microsoft.public.scripting.wsh newsgroup will be able to help though.<p>
