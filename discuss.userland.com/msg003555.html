<b><ol>(a) do you really need everyone reloading every 5 seconds? Sure, sometimes everyone needs to reload at once, but it seems like a waste to have to settle on a fixed interval.</b><p>

<ol><i>One of the approaches that XML (DOM specifically) makes very easy is to just send updates to the XML tree. When you first send the content of the interactive document (say 100k of XML text) each element comes with an internally generated (by the server) ID. As changes are made in the server you mirror those changes in the client by only sending XML fragments to update/replace elements by their ID. The client then handles rerendering the portions of the XML document covered by the update. </i></ol></ol><p>

Ken, thanks for the info on DOM,  I hadn't thought of that. <p>

The principal is a good one.  Don't send data that you already have sent--don't rely on reload whole pages.  The problem is that HTTP is not a broadcast protocol, and what Bernie wants to do is broadcast.
