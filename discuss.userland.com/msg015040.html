"You can think of a WML document as a deck of cards. Usually, a WAP device will be able to display a single card at a time. To generate the WML version of a Manila site's homepage, the server grabs the content of the most recent discussion group message displayed on the homepage and splits it up into several cards, one card per paragraph. The server automatically adds navigation links for moving to the next and previous card in a deck." <p>

In other words, if you want to do a WAP site, Manila is the best choice. <i>Easy, powerful, inexpensive.</i><p>

BTW, we're supporting two open standards, WAP and WML, which are subsets of HTTP and XML, respectively. As far as we're concerned no one needs to render the content. If you do, you can pay $20K to GeoWorks. Let me know how it goes. ";->"<p>

EditThisPage.Com: <a href="http://www.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$34">Let's Have a Meeting!</a><p>

<a href="http://www.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$37">Dan Mitchell says</a> De Anza College is the perfect location. "We have everything you would need: rooms from large to small with network access and projection systems. And we are in a good location close to freeway access."<p>

<a href="http://www.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$39">Jeremy Roschelle</a> says SRI International is a likely choice because it's a "non-profit in Menlo Park with a long history of augmenting human capabilities thru tools. I think we are particularly relevant because of the ideas of Doug Englebart." Excellent! What an honor it would be to present our work at the home of Augment. Let's have the second meeting at SRI.<p>

<a href="http://www.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$36">James Harris says</a> UC-Berkeley is a fine place for such a meeting. "Phil Greenspun gave a talk at the Haas Business School several months ago to a packed-out audience."<p>

In the last few days two websites, <a href="http://blackholebrain.editthispage.com/2000/02/16">BlackHoleBrain</a> and <a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com/2000/02/16">NetDyslexia</a>, have been outdoing each other in coolness.

<a href="http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/2000/02/lastpage/">Dale Dougherty</a>: "If you're going to invest in building a corporate portal, don't buy a ready-made solution. Find someone who really knows your company inside out and can work well with people inside and outside your company. Create a Weblog for your home page to manage the flow of information that passes through this gate, using recommendations to increase interactions with a widening circle of people, inviting customers to come inside and helping your organization stay in touch with what's happening outside."<p>

Reuters: <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20000206/tc/tech_mergers_1.html">Silicon Valley Merger Mania</a>. "Industry veterans say the telltale sign of a startup created for the express purpose of being acquired is excessive spending on advertising and marketing. Less apparent, with these companies, they note, is a woeful lack of investment on more substantive matters, like product development."<p>

I don't think there's an Internet Bubble. I do believe there's a Quality Bubble, and it might be mistaken for the IB. A lot of very thin companies are making lots of money. Just like the Denial of Service problem, it was always there, but it took a while for the wakeup call to come.<p>

You know what this made me think of? The original Mac OS guy, <a href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.04/04.06/Hertzfeld/">Andy Hertzfeld</a>; and one of his successors, <a href="http://www.spies.com/~darin/resume.html">Darin Adler</a> (he did Multifinder, and was the development lead on System 7), working on user interfaces for Linux at <a href="http://www.eazel.com/people.html">Eazel</a>. This is such an important direction. <p>

Andy and Darin also worked on General Magic's <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/mainStreet.gif">HyperCardish</a> user interface called "Main Street". As it turns out it was a little ahead of its time, off in a cul de sac. This time around, if they're doing what I think they are, they're actually *on* Main Street, and competing with their long-ago employer, Apple.<p>

BTW, at the intro of Darwin I asked Avi Tevanian why they weren't building on Linux at Apple. I still don't understand why they aren't. It seems Andy figured it out. I hope they're doing good work at Eazel. (BTW, Susan Kare, who did all the icons for Frontier, is also at Eazel. For some <a href="http://www.scripting.com/wavs/brain.wav">reason</a> I think of Susan Kare when I think of Susan Kitchens.)<p>

<a href="http://www.pbs.org/nerds/part3.html">Andy Hertzfeld</a>: "Steve Jobs kind of came bopping by my cubicle saying OK you're working on the Mac now. And I said well I have to finish up this Apple 2 stuff I'm doing here. No you don't that stinks that's not going to amount to anything you gotta start now. And I said well just give me a few days to finish and he said no and what he did was he pulled the plug on my Apple 2 that I was programming just losing, losing the code I'm working on and start taking my computer and walking away with it and what could I do but follow him out to his car cause he had my machine he plopped it down in the trunk and drove me over to this remote building, took the computer out, walked upstairs, plopped it down on a desk, well you're working on the Mac now."<p>

Andy, Darin et al: Please consider working on "MacBird".<p>

Derek Powazek used to complain about weblogs, now he's <a href="http://www.powazek.com/">got one</a>. Suggestions. Lose the scrolling textarea, stop obfuscating the links, and btw, it's really tacky to open a new window on every link. About SalonHerringWiredFool.Com, all the pubs know we're doing it. It's a new technology called <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/09/03/theDarkSideOfSyndication">syndication</a>. They get flow, they like it. <p>

Looks like I hit a nerve over in PowazekLand. OK, yes, to answer your question, you do need design help. Your site is the most brain-damaged weblog I've ever seen. "Design" does not mean "Do it differently from everyone else." Derek, you don't even know how to do a friggin email link. Learn, you're still young, there's time!!<p>
