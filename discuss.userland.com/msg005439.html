The problem is that most people can't resolve any userland.com addresses: the DNS system seems to think that userland.com is a non-existant domain.<p>

The details:<p>

Our ISP, conxion.net, hosts our DNS on three nameservers: ns1.conxion.net is primary, and ns3 and ns4 are secondaries.<p>

It appears to me -- and the tools I've used -- that the DNS is configured properly on their nameservers. (Outside of nit-picky things, that is. Some people might prefer to CNAMEs to all those A records, that kind of thing.)<p>

It's the same set-up as for scripting.com, scriptingnews.com, and so on -- which are all working fine.<p>

userland.com is registered, of course, and you can do a whois and see that the record is as it should be, it lists Conxion's nameservers.<p>

I called InterNIC -- they assure me that their records are fine, the root servers are returning the correct information.<p>

The people at Conxion are trying to track down the problem, but the problem started yesterday, and it's still going on.<p>

I've read a lot about DNS, sent email to various places (Ask Mr. DNS and similar), come up with lots of theories, but I still don't know what the problem is.<p>

If there are any DNS experts or admins who can lend a hand, who can help figure out what's wrong and how to fix it, we'd all appreciate it.
