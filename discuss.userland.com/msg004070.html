Think of something like the Windows registry or the NEXTSTEP Defaults Database, only using an open wire protocol.<p>

The ACAP web site, <A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/acap/"><a href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/acap/">http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/acap/</a></A>, has some more information on the protocol.  It's not hideously complicated, and is already supported by a couple of commercial <A HREF="http://www.cyrusoft.com/">applications</A>.<p>

Another choice is to store your preferences on a single global filesystem like <A HREF="http://www.transarc.com/">AFS</A>.  That's how roaming was implemented at Carnegie Mellon University (among other schools), and speaking from experience it's very easy to take such features for granted.
