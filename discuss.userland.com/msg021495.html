>>The reason I and many other Mac users still use AppleScript is that although AppleScript itself is a travesty, there's a lot of power to be had by integrating all the different scriptable applications on a typical Mac. Doing what I do on Windows or Unix would be far more difficult since applications on those systems are not designed to be scripted. The AppleEvents model is quite powerful, even if the language most people use to access it is abominable. What's needed is a better language. There are alternatives to AppleScript, though most of them have problems of their own. What I really want is a Java-like language that can access the Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) on the Mac. >>
