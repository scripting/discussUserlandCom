Jini uses RMI, which uses TCP, which uses IP. Of course, to use IP you have to have an IP address. As far as I can tell, Jini claims that devices can recognize each other as soon as they are plugged in, but I don't see how IP addresses are assigned.<p>

Once a device has its IP address, the multicast-based discovery protocol is pretty obvious, but how adresses are assigned is a big question.<p>

(As an aside, my local network has melted down for some reason...)
