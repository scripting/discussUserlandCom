I was talking about the response that the server sends when the user clicks on the Pike button. Let's look at an example:<p>

The user clicks the Pike button, and his browser sends this to the server:
<pre>
GET /something/editInPike$1234 HTTP/1.0
Host: discuss.whatever.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.7 (whatever)
</pre><p>

Then the server sends back to the browser:
<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: UserLand Frontier/whatever
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/vnd.userland-pike
Content-Length: xxx<p>

#server discuss.whatever.com
#msgNumber 1234<p>

This is the contents of message 1234 on the DG of discuss.whatever.com.
</pre><p>

The browser would save the above contents to a file and then send that file to Pike (using AppleEvents on MacOS; I forget how it works on Windows). Pike would read the contents of the file into a new window, stripping out the #directives that tell it where to send the modified content to.
