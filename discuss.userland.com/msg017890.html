The port that Pike runs on is a user preference. Most people run it on 80, which is appropriate since it's HTTP. However if you're already running something on 80, as I am (I also run Frontier) you have to choose a different port. As a user I can choose whatever port I want. UserLand would not ship software running on 81 by default. Hope this makes sense.
