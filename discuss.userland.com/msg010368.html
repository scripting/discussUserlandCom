Just as it may be "fair use" to use a short portion of a copyrighted work in a review without permission, using the whole thing is not fair use.  The difference is scope.<p>

Without expressing an opinion on the subject at hand, I'd submit that automatic and manual "scraping" is so night-and-day different, that one should not use the same term for them.<p>

(Isn't there a better metaphor/word then "scrape"?  Sounds violent, even when allowed.  "Sure, you can scrape my site." is kinda wierd.)<p>

(Also, note that if you hire 20 people to do the same work that one computer would do automatically, you still don't "get away with it".  The scope difference occurs as a result of amount of stuff scraped, not the originating source (human vs. machine).  No loopholes there.)
