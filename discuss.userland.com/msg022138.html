I think it's totally imprudent of us to build these fantastic communities, and rich archives, with no way of knowing that they will be accessible a year from now. They <i>must</i> be, we must make sure of that. I imagine that Yahoo has no knowledge that their service is being used to plan the next layer of the Internet. Operating that service has got to be profitable, we must make sure of that.<br><br><a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/04/02/wall.html">Larry Wall</a>: "Many of you know what happens when the size of your Perl process exceeds the size of your physical memory — you start thrashing."<br><br>Can you believe someone whined at me about the bit last night about the NY subway. Hey, I'm not responsible for the tunnels that connect the subway lines in NY. I live 3000 miles away. They were built before I was born. I don't want to invalidate anyone's feeling of disempowerment, but there's a router error if you think I'm the Dept of Complaints for the NYC subway system. However, when I <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$999">rode</a> the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$998">subway</a> last October I couldn't help noticing how much cleaner everything is. I watched a guy wash down one of the tunnels with a high power water hose. I asked how often he does it. "Every night," he said. Now that's a change for the better!<br><br>
