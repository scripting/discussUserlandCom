I'm not sure that the polls and reporters are accurate.  Can it be that Americans don't care if their politicians are criminals?<p>

President Clinton should be subject to prosecution just like the rest of us.  I'm not his judge or jury, but the Senate is.  If found guilty of a criminal act, (perjury, sexual harassment, etc.), then he should be removed from office.<p>

As Commander in Chief, he is part of the military.  Several recent trials have shown that the military takes on-the-job sexual activity seriously.  If others have been tried for similar offenses, why not President Clinton.  If guilty, he should suffer the consequences.<p>

It may not have been appropriate to ask him about his sex life - but that doesn't give him an excuse to lie about it.<p>

I deplore the horrendous expense - but "justice for all" is worth it.
