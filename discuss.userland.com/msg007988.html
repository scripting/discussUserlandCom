The intent of the original post was simply to provide feedback on some of the minor technical choices you have made in my.userland.com - things you might not notice on a fast workstation.  Thus, I thought it would be useful <i>for you</i> if I brought them to you attention.<p>

So to cut myself short, the <b>question</b> is this: what is the appropriate mode to send userland people feedback, without crossing to the bad side of the fine line between complaining and giving useful feedback?<p>

Clarification would be appreciated.<p>

thanks,<p>
