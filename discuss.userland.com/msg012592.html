They don't look so revolutionary these days, since most large-scale developments include open space, mixed use, walking paths, etc. -- things that made Reston (and <a href="http://www.therousecompany.com/operation/commdevel/columbiaindex.html">Columbia</a>) really cool when new. <p>

by Intentional communities, maybe you are thinking of something more like <a href="http://www.cohousing.org/">cohousing</a>? A group of folks get together, have endess meetings to build consensus, build their space, then contribute to the work of maintaining it and networking together. One needs a high tolerance for committee meetings to live in such a place, I think! But the results can be worthwhile. <p>
