"Meanwhile, the RIAA is amassing their troops for an assault on Internet piracy, or at least it seems that way. The association is distributing letters and a petition to various artists soliciting support for the RIAA's 'Soundbyting Campaign.' <p>

It appears they intend on shaming Internet users into submission. The letter asks artists for quotes supporting anti-Internet piracy. The artists are free to make up their own quotes, plus the letter offers up some pre-fab suggestions ranging from from catch phrases ("Stealing Music Is Wrong. Get real. Get legit"); to pleadings ("...Remember, I sing for my supper"); to threats ("The RIAA is making sure that people who break the law are held accountable")."<p>

The URL for that campaign site: <a href="http://www.soundbyting.com/">http://www.soundbyting.com/</a><p>

That campaign was "targeted" at students at universities...<p>

Also, I put together a small collection of articles about Phone.com's patents on my weblogs.com site.<p>
