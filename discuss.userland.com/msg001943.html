I used to make a buying trip to Printer's Inc. whenever the reading queue got low. I still go there, and still buy books, but a look at the office bookshelf shows that most of my professional business now goes to Amazon. I pull up the Amazon site, gesture at it, and books magically appear a few days later. That this, combined with hundreds of other people doing the same, might contribute to my local bookstore going *poof* doesn't
enter my consciousness. Printer's Inc. is within walking distance,
but Amazon is closer. And many of us are helping make it that way.
