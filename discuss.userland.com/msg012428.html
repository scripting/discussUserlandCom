FWIW, note that none of this, so far, has come from any of the pubs.<p>

So far I got one email from Rafe Needleman at Herring asking if it was automatic or done by hand. In other words, it has barely penetrated their awareness, by any measurement I can take. <p>

I think what you're hearing is predictable coffee-housing from people who like to discuss things. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but the principals haven't said anything yet.<p>

Here is the only marketing logic that works:<p>

** Markets are conversations
** Conversation is fire
** Marketing is arson<p>

If you're not an arsonist, you're not marketing. You can't make 
markets by not talking about them. You can't make markets by 
*announcing* a bunch of *messages*.<p>

I believe in the Web. I believe in YOU, brother.
