<ul>
<li>I don't see how BrowserCo can have a viable business model.  What can they sell?  Who would be interested in buying?  How can they serve as a counterweight to the remainder of Microsoft?
<li>Even under the best of circumstances, running MS applications through a Unix-compatibility layer would be slower, more memory-intenstive, less robust, etc., than running MS applications directly on an MS operating system.  So MS would still be able to leverage their Windows/Office desktop monopoly into selling W2K Server, and people selling other server applications would still be at a disadvantage.
</ul>
