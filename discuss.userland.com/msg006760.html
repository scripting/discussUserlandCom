have any of you looked at the downloadable examples from the book Dave pointed to a couple of days ago?
The URL is
<a href="http://dhtml-guis.com/game/">http://dhtml-guis.com/game/</a><p>

It seems to me to be a fine example of a proof that DHTML is not an appropriate technology for 'thin client' software. It's not very good or robust, and if you look at the amount of HTML / JSCRIPT / CSSs it's not very thin either. And how fast it downloads!<p>

Well worth a look, though, to see what this technology can do i.e. not very much.<p>

Whether such a non-functional technology is worth writing a book about is another matter.<p>

(This is said in a spirit of 'it's interesting to see what works and what doesn't, not in any negative way)<p>
