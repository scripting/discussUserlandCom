Same here, actually. Look at the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/customdns/LICENSE.X11?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&cvsroot=customdns">license</a> on CustomDNS, my current skunkworks project. (And a suprisingly good source of consulting revenue.)<p>

I use the XFree86 license, because I don't care if someone makes a proprietary version of CustomDNS. In fact, one of my clients intends to create an in-house version (for their website), and I spent this morning encouraging them.<p>

I'm just trying to explain why other developers occasionally see some merit in the GPL. It's a counter-intuitive license, but some people find it useful.<p>

<b>Commercial Developers</b><p>

<i>Please note I agree with Dave Winer that commercial software is not the same thing as proprietary software. Commercial has to do with being a going business concern with cash flow, and doesn't imply a closed or antisocial technological model.</i><p>

Trust me. I know. ;-)<p>

My consulting business <i>is</i> a going concern, with cash flow. But I release all my products as open source. I even have advertising copy for my open source software, complete with tacky, annoying hype. Somehow, I still make a pretty decent living.<p>

I call myself a "commercial open source developer". I also consider myself lucky to have such a great job!<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
