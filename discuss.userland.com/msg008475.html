I have the local Compaq dealer coming tomorrow (for the fourth visit) to try to fix a 5100 workstation that keeps crashing for no obvious reason.  Changed power supply, kept doing it, tomorrow we change the motherboard.  It's at least a good dealer. (Computer ER in NY)  The first guy Compaq sent, from another dealer, lied about replacing the motherboard, and the computer died ten minutes after he was out the door.<p>

I would love to hear of a vendor who does it a different way.<p>

It could be worse, however.  You could have some random NT problem.  They'll charge you $95 to tell you to format and reinstall... Dell doesn't have that option.
