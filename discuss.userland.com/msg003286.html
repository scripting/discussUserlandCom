<li>The easy one first. As a user, what other messages would you link your message to? I'll go ahead and manually add your message to the response list of those messages. <p>

<li>Why don't you step up and do the UI for the graph-based discussion group. Make sure it works in a web browser.<p>

<li>The graphic on the page you pointed to is broken. Oooops. If Murphy is active where you live (he is) it probably broke the minute you dis'd this software.
</ol><p>

BTW, when I was a math major I studied graph theory. I know what graphs are. I also know that hierarchies are easy for people. It's easy to implement a graph on a computer, it's hard for people to do it in their minds, and it's hard work to find all the places you might want to attach a node.</li></li></li>
