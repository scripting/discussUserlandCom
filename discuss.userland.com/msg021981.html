A few months ago he discovered Manila and then dove into Frontier and Radio UserLand.<br><br>	Russ is a writer and a thinker. And he did something wonderful, he wrote an explanation of what we do at UserLand from the point of view of a Notes developer. His two pieces, linked below, are the top stories on DominoPower now.<br><br>	DominoPower: <a href="http://www.dominopower.com/issues/issue200011/frontier001.html">How UserLand's Frontier can revolutionize content management</a>.<br><br>	DominoPower: <a href="http://www.dominopower.com/issues/issue200011/manila001.html">A closer look at Manila and Radio UserLand</a>.<br><br>	I hope people in the Notes community read these articles. And a note to IBM people who read Scripting News -- we want to build bridges between our software and yours. We're working on a complete SOAP interface for Manila, we think it'll be the broadest SOAPable web app when it's ready (early December). We're a very small company focused on making the Web a great writing environment. We like working with big companies with large installed bases and marketing and distribution systems. We think we have good software, but we can't do it all.<br><br>
