Feyman is known as an incredible renaissance man who believed that science (and explanations in general) should be clear, straight forward, and as simple as reasonably possible).<p>

Feyman knew of Tuva because he had collected stamps as a child and has seem the interesting diamond shaped stamps of a small country called Tannu Tuva .  Feyman and his Friend Ralph Leighton decided, in the early 80's (during the height of the cold war), that they wanted to visit Tannu Tuva because it's capital city, <b>KYZYL</b> was spelled so crazily.<p>

The subsequent book, <a href = “http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393029530/o/qid=937110853/sr=8-1/002-0241552-3865248 “>"Tuva or Bust"</a> describes the adventures of these intrepid travelers as they try to get permission to travel to this obscure portion of central Asia.  Along they way they learn of Tuva's rich history and culture including throat singing.  It's defiantly a fun book, and those interested in learning more about Tuva, Feyman, or reading a great (and true) adventure story should check it out.
