Truth be told, there's a shitload of open source in the Frontier 1.0 release. Now the license agreement zealots (like ESR and Stallman) will ask where's the license agreement? But come on folks, when you ship source, it's out. In any case, we explicitly said people could use the source for whatever purpose they wanted to.

If someone implemented a Frontier-compatible system and used the scripts that came with Frontier 1.0, would that be OK?<p>

What if they shipped the scripts from Frontier 1.0?<p>

What if they used or shiped the scripts from Frontier 6.0?<p>

Licenses matter a lot, unfortunately.
