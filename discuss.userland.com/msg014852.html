We're still early in the process, and we're working on lots of other things too.<p>

But the early results are very encouraging. Frontier running under WINE can serve a Manila site -- which means lots of layers below Manila are working. mainResponder, the webserver framework, the built-in HTTP server, the website framework, XML verbs, low-level verbs like string, address, and file verbs. It's pretty amazing.<p>

But there are things that still cause crashes: outline rendering is the big one we've found so far. I just found another chunk of code in manilaSuite.filters.firstFilter that can cause a crash: I'm working on narrowing down exactly which line of code is responsible.<p>

It's a process, and we have to go step-by-step. At some point we plan to compile Frontier with the WINE libraries and build a Linux binary, but we're not there yet.<p>

WebEditServer totally works, by the way, which is also encouraging -- it means that XML-RPC works.
