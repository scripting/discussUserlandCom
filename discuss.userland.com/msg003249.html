This package of tools is designed to simplify and enhance website management in Frontier. The goal was to create a modular system that adapts to the requirements of any particular site. Ocha v1.0b7 is free software (GPL open source) compatible with Frontier 4 and higher for Macintosh and Windows.<p>

Highlights from this release include:
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with Frontier 6 (untested).
<li><a href="http://www.ocha.net/modules/news/">News Room</a> v1.0b7 including a new browser shared menu feature on the Mac.
<li>Includes Enhanced imageRef Macro (EIR) v2.2 with <a href="http://www.ocha.net/plugins/imageref/">recently updated docs</a>.
<li>A new time tracking utility that utilizes menu commands and the Frontier status window to help you keep track of how much time you've been spending on each project/website.
</ul><p>

There have also been a large number of miscellaneous <a href="http://www.ocha.net/suites/ocha/history.html">changes and enhancements</a> in the past few months since the last release. The documentation has not been updated for this version because we expect some more changes to the menu structure before too long. Your help and participation is appreciated. Thanks!<p>
