I got tired of looking at all the old messages, so I changed it so that the main page only lists today's messages and yesterday's.<p>

I'm working on other stuff now. Don't expect major enhancements to this software at this point. I'm working with Frontier-based message interfaces, I don't normally type into web browser windows, as a writer I'm not well-supported here, so I'm upgrading the tools I use to edit Scripting News to fit into mainResponder.<p>

Moving towards Nirvana...<p>
