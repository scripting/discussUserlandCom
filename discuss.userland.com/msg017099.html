I was thinking of doing it a slightly different way, but I'm not sure which one would really be more work to implement.<p>

Since pike already listens at a port that is known to whatever Manila site is serving up the editable pages (say it's 81), why not take advantage of it? The "Edit in Pike" button could simply make a link something like "http://localhost:81/www.editthispage.com/something/editInPike$1234" which would be a request to the Pike instance running on the author's machine.  Pike would receive this request from the user's browser and know to go grab the contents of "http://www.editthispage.com/something/editInPike$1234" and start editing away.<p>

This is somewhat similar to the proxy server approach, but in this case Pike is acting as the proxy server.  The nice thing (for those of use locked behind firewalls) is that the only connections ever made to the outside of the firewally are just "normal" HTTP request that look like any other request a web browser might make.<p>

I realize this type of solution might not be any less difficult to implement than the helper app approach, but it might reduce browser configuration headaches a bit.  I thought I would at least throw it out there and see what people thought.
