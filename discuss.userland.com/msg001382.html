1. new pref: user.prefs.openAboutWindow, if not defined, startupScript creates it and sets it true. If it's true, we open the about window first thing when startupScript starts up. So even if you forget to leave it open when you quit you have a way to be sure it's open for messages displayed by processes that run at startup. The next feature required it.<p>

2. new table: user.databases. If it exists, loop over all the sub-tables, for each one that has a boolean, openOnStartup, whose value is true, open the guest database file it specifies in f. If it has a boolean runStartup and its true, run #startup at the top level of the database after opening it.<p>

3. No need to open the databases used by mainResponder, for now, config.root, discuss.root and members.root, they're opened by the #startup script in mainResponder.root.
