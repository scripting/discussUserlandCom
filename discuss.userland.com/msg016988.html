the anti-virus business, and to start taking security seriously.<p>

MS creates hundreds of niches for other software companies to thrive
by its existance. Once in a while, we've seen them go after one
of these niches and crush their competition like bugs. Once it was 
the FAX software people, another time it was people working on 3D 
software APIs, and most noticably it was Netscape's browser niche.
Having MS eat up the anti-virus business will be a development
most users would cheer.<p>

Breaking up Microsoft is brain-surgery with chainsaws, used to
remedy a mental health issue. But MS have been in denial about 
an obvious problem. By having their software everywhere, making all
the pieces play nice together, enabling automation, etc. they've
done some remarkable things. But they did this while ignoring
the core problem of security. It is time for them to realize the
fundemental problem and do something about it.<p>

When every cell around has the same DNA, new kinds of viruses thrive,
and these drive the development of new solutions. Really big
multi-cellular bodies have immune systems to protect themselves,
which are quite different (and several orders of magnitude more 
sophisticated) than the "anti-virus software" single-celled organisms
have.<p>

The problem of Security ("developing an immune system") looks too
big to me for MS to solve with a white paper. They can't just whip up 
a security-concious version of WScript.exe, cmd.exe and their other
general interpreters without breaking lots of stuff everywhere, and
they probably aren't going to really address the problems of users 
running unsafe content in any forseeable version of Windows.<p>

How about instead of breaking up MSoft, the US government passes a regulation specifying that no more than 50% of the desktops in any
work place may run an OS from the same manufacturer? There are
stupider regulations, and this will at least hinder the spreading
of viruses a bit, so it's a bit of a safety regulation. (I say from 
the same manufacturer to catch the smart alec who thinks that NT 
& Win98 are different OSes - "we play both kinds of music, Country
AND Western"...)<p>

This will break the MS monopoly, which is based on business sales.
It won't actually damage the company, but it will force it to 
deliver solutions for hetrogeneous environments.<p>

Web applications and cross-platform browsers (like the one made by
whatstheirname) will get a big boost out of this.<p>

People will stop sending Word and Powerpoint attachments (or stupider 
things; a publisher I know, a Mac-only shop, once received a logo from 
a client as an image file embedded in a Word document...).
