What you realy need; what we ( developers ) need are the protocols which the server and clients use to communicate. Basically its probably some UDP block command form; but you need to know what hte numbers or messages mean. Using XML, hello Dave, would be a step in the right direction.

Client to Server, logging on
<HELLO>
<ME>255.255.255.1</ME>
<PASSWORD encript="x254standard">ABCDE</PASSWORD>
<NAME>JOEL</NAME>
<LOCATION>TOKYO</LOCATION>
<TIME>5:30PM</TIME>
</HELLO><p>

Server to Client
<HELLO>
<USER> ACCEPTED </USER>
</HELLO><p>

Have Fun
