I never said I'd give some unnamed artist $50000 of my hard earned money. What for? What's in it for me?<p>

Here's what I said: I said I'd come up with $50000 to start a venture that creates a channel for musicians to get paid directly for their works distributed over the net. I want my cut, of course. Its an investment. I am betting that (a) we can do a much better job of it than the record companies and (b) we can do it in a way that doesn't cause all the wrongs that the current system has.<p>

Back to the original question I asked: how is Napster going to make money. I think the question is very relevant if we want to consider doing a venture that will compensate artists for their work yet make money for investors also. I am serious about this venture. Are you, or aren't you?
