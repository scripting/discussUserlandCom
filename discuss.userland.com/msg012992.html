After comparing the two groups I found the one with the problem was missing the defaultMembership directive in the sites table. (These are private groups.) Once I added this directive with the value of the membership group I already had in the membership directive, things linked fine.<p><p>I'm not sure why the scripts rely on defaultMembership directive when they should rely on the membership directive but I thought I would throw this out there in case others had a problem.<p><p>
