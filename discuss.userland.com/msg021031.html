yes, what used to be called Pike became what's known now as Radio Userland.<p>

<i>Is the intention that this free tool will remain free after Beta, and wouldn't it be a good idea to be explicit about that? </i><p>

I don't believe so. I can't find the message right now (searching for "addicted" <i>should </i>have found it), but Dave has said that Radio UserLand will be a for-sale product at some point the future.  I don't belive he's ruled out a lower-functionality free version, but he hasn't specifically said that's in the plans either.<p>
