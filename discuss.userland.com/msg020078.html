But, as you point out, they cannot get work done well, they are not as productive as they could be were the code open source. Closed source software effectively harms many people's productivity.

I beg to differ here. Our administrative assistants, secretaries, Moms & Dads, etc. aren't going to do any better with the software if it were open source than they are doing now.   Your argument is that if there is something that doesn't work, or they don't like that they'll just go in a fix it if it were open source.  That just won't happen.  Yeah there might be a MS Office Open Source group out there that is adding to it, but are they necessarily any better than Microsoft's developers - maybe, maybe not.
