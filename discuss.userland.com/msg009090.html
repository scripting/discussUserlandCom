Has anyone found any solutions for displaying HTML within an application? The alternatives seem to be ActiveX, Mozilla's NGLayout code, or writing my own.<p>

ActiveX doesn't seem to be supported at all. I searched all of Microsoft's site and couldn't find any references to ActiveX on the Mac. NGLayout seems pretty disorganized & I couldn't figure out how to get started with it. Writing my own HTML engine would take more time than I have, especially since we need to support inline graphics and full formatting.<p>

In our windows products, we can simply use an HTML browser control. I find it hard to believe there are no solutions on the Mac.
