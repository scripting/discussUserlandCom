Do you know who NeXT's customers *were*? Do you know
what we use NeXT's software *for*?<p>

I don't expect there would be hundreds of NeXT boxes, with
scores of developers, here at First Chicago if it were
'immature'. We certainly wouldn't be risking millions
and millions of dollars by running and developing
trading software on NeXT's OS.<p>

If your average Mac-based e-commerce website screws up,
chances are the impact is pretty minimal. Here, you
screw up an order, and you could be talking about a
$100 million deal hosed. The importance of using
'mature' systems is at an entirely different level
than what's typical for Mac servers.<p>

We certainly wouldn't have stayed with NeXT so long if the
tools weren't 'commercial quality'. Let alone paying $5,000
or so per developer seat in order to use those tools.
