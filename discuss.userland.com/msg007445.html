		<text>Here's the next revision of our scriptingNews web syndication format, started in 1997. It's got one major advantage over RSS, the items can be paragraphs that link to one or more web pages, which more accurately reflects what's going on. We would have preferred to work with Netscape, but they have had so many departures and are so confused that they can't remember that they committed to working with us. <i&gt;We love competition!</i&gt;</text>

You could make it possible to view only headlines, headlines and text or just text.  Just an idea that I think would be very useful.
