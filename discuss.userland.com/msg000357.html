OpenGL is a popular 3D API on all the other platforms, so more and more developers were calling for Apple to ship OpenGL support in MacOS. Since Apple has QuickDraw 3D and RAVE, they don't support OpenGL.<p>

Tired of waiting, a company called Conix wrote OpenGL drivers for the Mac and started shipping them. Since there's no competition, they're doing well and developers are happy that they have OpenGL. Since it's bundled with applications, users don't even have to pay for Conix OpenGL.<p>

There are rumors that Apple may license Conix OpenGL to include it with the MacOS, now that they can see its utility.<p>

I think XML could easily go the same way. UserLand, Netscape, Macromedia, and Adobe are all it would take.
