His reply? That "like GE", Amazon's engineers have the right to protect their innovations, if they're <b>considered patentable</b>. The "considered" is the interesting thing: a tacit recognition that Amazon have mastered the patent application process, by exploiting the naivety of the USPTO, rather than the technologies themselves.<p>

Of course, Amazon's patents are nothing like GE's. Although you could argue that there's a historical similarity: Thomas Edison was much better at patents than actual innovation.<p>

(Interestingly, the CNBC anchor didn't know about the boycott, so it was useful publicity. Time for a few press releases from noamazon.com, perhaps?)
