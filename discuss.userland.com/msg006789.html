As F6 stands, one good reason to go with tables is that the <i>performance</i> of outline rendering right now is not good.  Tables and XML are a good way to go for many other reasons though.<p>

Can someone point me to docs on how to author XML in Frontier?  I really want to do more there, but it's not clear to me how to get the information in there.<p>

Thanks<p>
