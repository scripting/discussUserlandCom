To get DSL you must normally be within 18000 feet of the central office.  USWest found that the number of complaints about their service rose during hot sunny days.  They found out that heat lowers the conductibility of copper so that 18000 figure dropped to 12 or 13000 feet.  I don't recall what they had to do to correct the problem.<p>

So sunshine may have something to do with it.
