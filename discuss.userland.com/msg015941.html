I downloaded the NN6 Preview release today (am writing in it as we speak) and was intrigued by the sidebar. There's some text in their "Learn More" section that says:<p>

<blockquote>Web developers: If you want to offer a My Sidebar Tab for your own content, see the instructions in the <a href="http://home.netscape.com/browsers/6/help/">Sidebar Developer's Guide</a>.</blockquote><p>

I followed the link, followed another link, and looked around. I did a search in their DevEdge area, and can't find a thing about developing a custom sidebar. I was hoping that there would be some way to leverage RSS files to build a sidebar, but the lack of documentation is frustrating.<p>

Has anyone else found the Netscape sidebar documentation? Does it leverage RSS? If so, I'd love to find out more about it.<p>

Thanks!<p>
