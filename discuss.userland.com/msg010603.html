I agree on the UserLand branding, and I did not actually want to state anything different.<p>

BTW: The semantic implication of the name "User"+"Land" is representing a very valuable idea! I think "Micro"+"Soft" is quite a bad brandname compared to "Userland" (Did you protect that name?)<p>

But nevertheless I tried to give arguments with my feedback. I am not the god of good website design. I would have a hard time to work upon what you work upon. Critizising is easy. But that's the nature of feedbacks.... (maybe I'll look for examples - but not now...)<p>

p.s.: I am working on something to foster interaction between users and their content (Who doesn't?? ;-)) -- But you will get the opportunity to fire back soon - although the pusporse of it is not comparable to what we discuss. I am not quite sure if I'll use Frontier for it - but maybe...
