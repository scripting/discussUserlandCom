I like the word Radio much the way I liked "ThinkTank" in the 1980s. Now we're doing something different, there's communication in our idea processor, in fact its <i>purpose</i> is communication. What word says that better than Radio?<br><br><b>Outlining for the next 20 years<a name="outliningForTheNext20Years">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/24#outliningForTheNext20Years" title="Permanent link to 'Outlining for the next 20 years' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Outlining in the 80s was a <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/bootstrappingTheTwoWayWeb">bootstrap</a> for what we're doing now. Intuitively it always seemed that outlining was a structure for groupware. Now that this <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/radioAsAManilaDirectoryEditingTool#howToIncludeAnotherDirectory">works</a>, we have to streamline, groom, document, present and evangelize these ideas, not only to writers and thinkers, but also to developers of tools and server-side runtimes. Even widgets that run in the browser can benefit from hooking into great authoring tools.<br><br><b>viewDirectoryBox macro<a name="viewdirectoryboxMacro">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/24#viewdirectoryboxMacro" title="Permanent link to 'viewDirectoryBox macro' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	When we released the <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$3505">directory feature</a> on Wednesday, we provided a macro that allowed authors to include the top level of a directory inside a table that you constructed. This gave you a lot of power, but it was more power than anyone really needed. So between meals on Thanksgiving I thought it through, and created a new macro that's higher level, it makes it easy to create a nice-looking box without having to think too much. It's called <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/viewDirectoryBoxMacro">viewDirectoryBox</a>.<br><br><b>What about music?<a name="whatAboutMusic">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/24#whatAboutMusic" title="Permanent link to 'What about music?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	We will loop back to music when the legal michegas is over and there's an economic system that works for honest people without limiting the role music can play in the evolution of the new medium. I will continue to be active in the discussion about music on the Internet, but we're going to stay pure, to provide tools for people to create and distribute their own knowledge and ideas.<br><br><b>What about Lieberman?<a name="whatAboutLieberman">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/24#whatAboutLieberman" title="Permanent link to 'What about Lieberman?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Oh Lieberman! He was supposed to have values. <br><br>	Today he spoke for moderation, while characterizing demonstrators as a mob. Sure it was a staged demo. Just watch the faces. But they were certainly no more unruly than the ones Jesse Jackson whipped up for the Dems in the first days after the election. <br><br>	Lieberman's call for moderation was itself immoderate. Remember those who made excuses for the Reps <i>and</i> Dems who signed off on the CDA. They depended on the courts to do the right thing. The courts did cover them. Here we go again. <br><br>	Do you trust the Supreme Court? I'm not sure I do. We're proud that there are no tanks in the street. Let's keep it that way.<br><br>	"dorothy"<br><br>
