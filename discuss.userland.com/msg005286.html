(Update: this only works for locally stored pages. If you try to open a remote page, the editor tries to open a file which was never written, or perhaps was deleted too quickly.)<p>

This pretty much works with IE 4, too. If you add an Edit action
for the HTML file type, you get a 'Page' menu item under the Edit menu. (As in 'Edit Page')<p>

(Yay. Now I can bring them up in Emacs, instead of Notepad. Now I'll go away before I dissolve into a rant about Windows' crummy File Types editing UI. Gack. Couldn't they at least offer the option of listing them by extension?)
