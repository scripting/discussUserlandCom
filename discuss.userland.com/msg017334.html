Actually, the smart car concept was started by Swatch on their own.  They then went looking for a partner & Mercedes was the pick.<p>

I may be mistaken, but I do not believe that the development was parallel to that of the A-class.  The smart car was commercialised before and it did not get the bad press over the bad handling (yes, the rollover) the A-class car got in its pre-release version.  They do look similar however.<p>

Mercedes has since bought out Swatch's share in the joint venture.
