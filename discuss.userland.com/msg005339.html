A few weeks ago I was burned out beyond belief, just finishing a product cycle, I  was looking forward to a vacation. <p>

Now I'm still dealing with the aftermath of all the work I did, my almost-44-year-old body doesn't rebound from these bouts of heavy lifting the way it did when I was in my 20s. <p>

But all these are secondary, I think, to the need to make my own decision, not to be railroaded into committing to something that I wasn't sure we could deliver on. <p>

I'm still not sure we can deliver on the Linux version, but after yesterday's experiments, I'm much closer to being a believer. WINE is very impressive. But I remember Murphy, my very close friend and constant teacher.
