Same with some other sites Dave is pointing to.<p>

The "economics of attention" (eyeballs, shortly put) is getting more severe from day to day. Who reads more than 2 newspapers a day? Who visits more than let's say 8 or 10 sites on a regular basis?<p>

For me, web logs like scripting.com (which are useful exactly <B> because of</B> so called "Deep Linking") are the only manageable way to use the WWW as an information medium, they are like the special interest editorial staffs that help me find the content I am interested in.<p>

Taking my case as an example, the more places like scripting.com link to Infoworld, the better for them. It's that simple.
