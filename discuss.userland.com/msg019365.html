One trivial way to do it would be to do clock.sleepFor(the length of the song you're playing).  At the end of that time, put the next song on the queue.  This is assuming nobody tries to stop/rewind the current song, of course.  If it's possible to query the status of the MP3 player once the thread wakes up, for example how much time the song has remaining, this might make this strategy work a bit better, to avoid cutting songs off.<p>

Of course, callbacks would be much nicer.<p>
