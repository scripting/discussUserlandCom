Bray says: "Namespaces have names, and the names are URIs, which usually means URLs. What does the URL point at?  So far, nothing in particular. RDDL is an attempt to imagine something useful to have a namespace name point at. It's mostly a human-readable discussion, with labeled links built in, pointing at... well anything that might be helpful with that namespace. Like a stylesheet, or some useful code, or some copyright notices."<br><br>Jake's all-new <a href="http://bionic.manilasites.com/">bionic weblog</a>. <i>Woo hoo!</i><br><br>I love getting <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/jeffBarrClientSideSOAP.gif">emails</a> like this one. Makes my day.<br><br>I'm falling way behind on responding to emails. Next week is going to be very very busy. Everyone I know is coming to town, and it's not all because of MacWorld Expo. Oy.<br><br>When I'm doing the final edit on DaveNet pieces I often use <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/">dictionary.com</a> to look up spelling and to be sure I'm using the right word. This is one way I expand my vocabulary and make my stories more interesting. This morning their server is very slow. Almost non-functional. Then I imagine that their servers are getting pounded by a dozen stupid search engine crawlers looking up every stupid word to see if its definition has changed. (Clue: they don't change very often.) The Internet is so stupid sometimes. Not sure this is happening at dictionary.com, but I can't tell you how much time we waste fighting idiotic agents on our servers.<br><br>For just these occasions I have a list of <a href="http://www.superopendirectory.com/directory/4/software/webApplications/dictionaries">alternate dictionaries</a>. Send me pointers to others you like. And if anyone from dictionary.com is tuned in, thank you, I couldn't write without your service. You can quote me on that. <br><br>
