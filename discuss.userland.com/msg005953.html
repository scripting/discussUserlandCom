That's what I do. Of coarse that keeps them from being rendered at all.  You may need to write your own version of outLineSite that looks at a directive that you add to your pages that cause them to be skipped.  Take the version in html.data.standardMacros and copy it to user.html.macros or your tools Table	In this bundle<pre>bundle //we ignore some objects...	if name beginswith "#" 		continue	case name 		defaultname		"tools"		"data"		"testing"		"images"		"glossary" 			continue	if adrsubitem == adrPageTable^.adrObject  //don't include the page being rendered		continue</pre>add another condition like<pre>	if html.getOneDirective (yourDirectiveName, adrsubitem^) == "false"  //meaning don't include		continue</pre>	I haven't tested this but it should work.<i>This is not gonna work yet either gonna take more diggin</i><p><p>
