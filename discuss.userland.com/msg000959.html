Would it be of interest to people to have a version of XML RPC that is not tied to a transport medium and a server?<p>

There could be a XML RPC spec that just describes the XML structure and then higher level specs that describe XML RPC over HTTP, or over TCP, etc.<p>

For example, I'm serious considering using the XML structure specified in XML RPC for project I'm working on, but it involves RPC calls between a non-web client and server, using TCP (sockets) as the transport medium. Speed of the RPC call is not an issue. What I like about using XML RPC is:<p>

a) Easy to debug - it's mostly human readable.<p>

b) Out of order argument passing - arguments are "tagged" and can be written and read in any order.<p>

c) Others can implement clients or servers and not have to implement a trick binary protocol for the RPC scheme.<p>

d) Cross platform - anywhere there's an XML parser that is.<p>
