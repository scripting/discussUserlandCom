My mother and father got divorced when I was 10, and I found out that he was dead in a rather matter-of-fact way, long after the fact (I was born in Iowa, after my parents divorced we moved to Washington State).<p>

I don't even know where he's buried, or if he was cremated, or whatever.  I need to find out.<p>

The most moving part of the program (of the bit that I saw) was the little routine they went through at the hospice when someone died.  They gather all the caretakers and wash the body.  And then they all gather around the body and talk about the person.  They'd talk about how they related to the person, how the person related to them.  It was simple, it was beautiful.<p>

Too often death, and coping with death, is completely ignored.  When it surfaces, it is pushed to the side.<p>

And yet birth, life, and death are the only experiences that we all truly share.<p>

Where was I going with this?  I don't know.  I just felt like sharing.<p>

Thanks for listening.<p>
