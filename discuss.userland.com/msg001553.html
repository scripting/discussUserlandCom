You are supporting a man who fought to find money for new teachers during the last budget negotiation. Someone who attempted to reform health care. There are many other similar examples.<p>

To me, your negatives and the examples I just cited above are one of the most perplexing things about American Democracy.  The machine forces pragmatic responses to problems, while (at least some) members of the public demand ideals based leadership. Clinton gets criticized for reading the polls, and for moving to the center because he "doesn't stand for anything". Yet you can't govern in this country without compromise.<p>

It's not surprising to me that women support Clinton. He has focused on issues which matter to a lot of women - healthcare, children. In addition, many women (gross generalization) are also much better at compromise, consensus oriented solutions building than men. I think the fact that Clinton works this way must generate empathy as well. <p>
