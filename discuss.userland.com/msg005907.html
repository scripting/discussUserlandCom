I don't blame you for having had the "sour grapes" barrier, so many people used it as an excuse to ignore what I was saying. I find this to be one of the most frustrating aspects of human nature, to find a reason to invalidate someone's point of view, but I find I do it too, so it is a flaw of the human mind, not just an individual mind.<p>

The only thing to do when no one listens is to take a hike and redefine yourself. I still get the sour grapes thing from time to time, not from people who say they used to give it to me. I think they're lost in time, if ever there was an issue with Apple, it's totally over now. We don't need them to go forward, they aren't in our way anymore. If they want to be smart, great, we can benefit from that, if they want to be stupid, that's OK too.
