Excellent!<p>

<i>It seems that the indexing messaging interface is pretty well defined, but I can't find anything on the query interface. What message does Manila send when the user is searching for something?</i><p>

None. Our current model is that the search page is hosted on the search engine server. We experimented with an XML-RPC interface for queries, too, but it turned out to add more overhead than we were willing to accept at that time.
