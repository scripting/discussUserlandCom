I already know what I'm going to use this for. Every night at midnight, your MTTF system will send out an email to anyone who wants it, a list of the links found daily on Camworld, the day before.<p>

I've been saying that I was going to do this for the longest time, but have never gotten around to it. Now, that you've got this automated system, well, hey, my life just got easier.<p>

One request: Can you make it so that the MTTF software does a BCC for multiple recipients? Kind of a like a mailing list...with a web front-end. Add/remove page for administrating the recipients list, and other nifty features like that.<p>

I could see this system being used for anyone who wants to send out regular messages at a specific time.<p>

Thanks for the super work!<p>
