hmmm...I don't think you can do it (I don't like to say that, because this is at the limits of my knowledge of Frontier - and I can't prove it - but if I'm wrong I'm sure someone's going to jump up and say "here's how...." )<p>

However, if you break the golden rule, and put a website at the root level of that table/control structure - then you can have a static home that is dynamically served :-).<p>

That is, the table should have the #ftpsite, #prefs etc, and the 'home' object - at the root level - will be served with <a href="http://www.mysite.edu/home.htm">http://www.mysite.edu/home.htm</a><p>
