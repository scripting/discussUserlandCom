Everything works fine. However, if I want to keep the exact same website structure, how can I point to static html files at the topmost level of the website if I set up some type of control structure--a table? For example, config.mainresponder.domains.default points to a table at workspace.mywebsite. In this table I can have an address object named DISCUSS pointing to the discussion group. That works. But if I have a fileSpec object named DEFAULT pointing to the folder containing static html files, those files aren't served. Instead, I just get the value of the fileSpec in the browser window. I could make a fileSpec named STATIC, but then my site structure is changed and I am forced to have a URL that looks like <a href="http://www.mysite.edu/static/home.htm">http://www.mysite.edu/static/home.htm</a> instead of <a href="http://www.mysite.edu/home.htm">http://www.mysite.edu/home.htm</a>. <p>

Any suggestions?<p>

I do think that a control structure--a table resembling a docTree is the way to go. There is more power, better control and probably better security.<p>

P.S. An older thread, but it takes some of us a while to catch on.
