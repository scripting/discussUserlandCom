Plenty of Mac apps have preferences dialogs that show a pull-down menu at the top, and the rest of the pane changes depending on what you select in the menu. This has many virtues: It's simple, it's easy to change from a developer point of view, it doesn't take up a whole lot of screen real estate.<p>

I assume when you mention the solution NewsWatcher uses, you're referring to a dialog with a window on the left that contains a scrolling list of labelled icons. (That's what MT-NewsWatcher uses; I haven't used plain-old NewsWatcher for years.) This was used for the Mac Control Panel at some point, I think pre-System 7. This is pretty but has a couple of disadvantages: I find that I don't distinguish between the icons as easily as I distinguish between phrases. Also, this solution takes up more space. I think the MT-NewsWatcher prefs dialog displays maybe four icons at once, while a pull-down menu can display easily 20 or more options on a modern display. And someone's gotta design the darn icons.
