Still, netstat -a should work just as well for this purpose.  It will show all listening ports.<p>

Unfortunately, neither method will actually tell you what process has the port open.  I don't know how to do this in NT.  There is probably some way to extract this information from the TCP/IP stack.  Perhaps the guys at www.sysinternals.com have done it.
