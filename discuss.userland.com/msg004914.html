thanks for the help. Unfortunately, even after deleting the @root.websites.["#data"] table, things are still not being indexed.<p>

Maybe on installation of Frontier, the user could be prompted to input the local preferences like hard-drive name, server name etc... and these settings could be propagated through the setup and updated where necessary. I'm sure Frontier 'wizards' would consider this unnecessary, but it might help newbies like me.<p>

cheers,<p>
