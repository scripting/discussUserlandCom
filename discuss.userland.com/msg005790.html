Well, the Afgans held off the entire Soviet military with a few (non-light) weapons and some international aid. Granted, their nation is now a horrifying mess, but the Russians never really controlled it.<p>

The American Revolution was fought by farmers against one of the most powerful empires in the world. The North Vietnamese didn't do too badly, either.<p>

Guerilla warfare in defense of your home is very effective, particularly in inhospitable terrain or against troops that don't have a good reason to win.<p>

<I>While it sounds good in theory that we can protect ourselves from a despotic government, how would those weapons stand up against the US  Military.</I><p>

Not very well. Most independent <I>nations</I> have trouble standing up against a tiny fraction of the US military. But remember, the US military is dependent upon the American people, and still believes in defending a free nation (even though the "free nations" in question tend to be Kuwait and Kosovo these days).<p>

To successfully defend a nation (or win a revolution), you need money. And you need to be able to spend that money on military-grade weapons. This was true in 1776 and it's true today. If nothing else, the Second Amendment is a token: it represents the right of the people to <I>try</I> to overthrow an oppressive government. The fact that you'd need bigger guns to actually succeed doesn't change the symbolism.<p>

Fortunately, the current US government works, and shows no immediate signs of breaking down.
