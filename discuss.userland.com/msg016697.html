The tough job is getting them to work on the documentation, and particularly on user's manuals and tools. <p>

Even the best software engineers tend to imagine that a job is done when they know how to do it. They realize they have to actually implement the work, but by they time they've done that last 10 percent, which always takes far more time and effort than they thought it would, they're sick of the whole thing. It takes skillful managers armed with whips and scorpions to drive them back to the job to finish documenting the project -- and it's even harder to get them to write user's manuals for people too dumb to see just how elegant the product is. </i><p>
