Why? Because any license that requires you to do this constitutes a contract to make another contract. As a matter of fact, it is a contract to make a <i>potentially infinite number</i> of other contracts. In most countries of the world, "meta-contracts" are invalid. And in jurisdictions where they <i>are</i> allowed, they are only valid if they state very specifically what contract is to be made, and with whom. Since the "meta-contract" requires you to make an unspecified (and potentially unlimited) number of contracts with a potentially infinite number of unidentified parties, it is not valid in <i>any</i> jurisdiction.
<P>
This renders both the GPL and the "wacky" license you propose above unenforceable as well as unethical.
