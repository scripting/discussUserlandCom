I thought it would be a great Idea if Frontier could directly execute Sctripts of any pluggable script interpreter!<p>

As far as I understand, I can have JScript, VBScript and Perl as DLLs (on Windows) and can wrap the calls with UserTalk to call a Script engine and handover a string of code and recieve the result - but I still have to do UserTalk code in front of any non-UserTalk call.<p>

Why not shortcutting this? I think it would be an insanly great thing to be able to define more script types than just "script" (for containing usertalk code). I'd like to be able to use a "perlscript" type if I have installed the corresponding script DLL.<p>

This would make Frontier a <b>real</b> scripting enviroment -- not sticked to UserTalk alone! I also could directly call any available script as macros inside the pages.<p>

I came up with this idea, when I had a discussion with someone who was not imperessed by Frontier in comparance to Perl. "That's not the point!", I said, "You may even develop your Perl stuff with Frontier and have a handy editor with some groupware functionality.".<p>

Is this "feature" hard to implement? Is it <i>wise</i> to implement it from a certain standpoint?<p>

It could make UserTalk obsolete and maybe mix up languages within a project and making it difficult to maintain or port anywhere else. <p>
