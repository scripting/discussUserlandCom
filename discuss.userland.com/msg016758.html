How is the translation handled?  Reading their press it is touted as just install, and the software will normalize everything to XML...how?  Is there a translator inside of webmethods or is it all done in java?  If I want my trading partner to trade with me and I am sending an IDOC how is he going to be able to use the data without running it through a translator?  I come from traditional EDI and have embraced XML but cant believe that Biztalk or WebMethods can possibly deliver what they are advertising without having to put a development team in place for the project.  Any idea how much the partner peice costs?  I have heard estimates for the "hub" company at 250,000...is that correct.  Your input would be greatly appreciated.
