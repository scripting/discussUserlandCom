How hard would it be to make Manila into a generic renderer rather than just an HTML renderer?  For example, I would love an outliner that had some awareness of LaTeX instead of HTML.  Updating a page that contained TeX would use a separate TeX app to generate a GIF of the hard math that HTML couldn't handle.  Perhaps a bit of syntax highlighting and a link to a separate TeX app would take care of it (or have you hidden lots of complexity too well?).<p>

Writing scientific papers and docs would be loads easier with such a system.  Math/physics/engineering types could then communicate over the web as easily as "regular text" people do now.  For example, "Hey, Professor, here's three horrible lines of calculus; where's my minus-sign error?" and then the prof could respond appropriately.<p>

In other words, Manila could be taught to shunt TeX/LaTeX to a separate app, thereby becoming a great scientific collaboration tool.<p>

Just a thought.
