I went domain name surfing, and found that getdns.com was not taken. I was surpriesd, but I figured that since most people don't know what DNS is, and my wallet was overly empty, that I'd wait. When I went back two days later with a renewed bank account, someone had taken the name.<p>

I had managed to score a couple of others, but I was frustrated, and suspected that someone was either intercepting my whois requests, or that (gasp) someone at the registrar I was using had seen the inquiry, and had nabbed the name for him/herself.<p>

FWIW, the registrar was <a href="http://register.com/">register.com</a>.
