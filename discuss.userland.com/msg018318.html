It appears that you need closed hardware for this to work.<p>

My reading of this is that they are encrypting each song for the particular player, and that player would have to have a unique (probably signed) private/public key pair. So now you have to protect that public/private key pair. For every player. Even the $20 ones. You will also need to protect the servers and the people making the players. <p>

My guess is that this will be attacked by sending the server a comprimised key, then decrypting the return values. Or, figure out how to encode two players with the same key. Perhaps someone will leave a key lying around (like dvd/decss).<p>


Unless you Trust the hardware, this sort of thing is fundamentally impossible to do. Somewhere in there is a single point of failure. It will be found, probably near the time of most embarrasing possible failure. <p>

Against all of these systems -- disappearing e-mail, rights management for music and videos, fair game playing -- there are two types of attackers: the average user and the skilled attacker. Against the average user anything works; there's no need for complex security software. Against the skilled attacker nothing works. And even worse, most systems need to be secure against the smartest attacker.
