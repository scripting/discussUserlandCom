If you would like to see what Netscape has been doing all this time, go here:
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/</a><p>

Download the build, try it out - kick the tires.
It doesnt install over your old browser or do bad things like add dlls or stuff to you system - it's self contained.<p>

M11 is the currently released Milestone.<p>


The same sort of dismissal that I was talking about with Macintoshes also applies to Netscape.  Not everyone uses IE, nor will they. And it would take far less than you think for the tide to turn again :)
