It tells the channel provider how often the channel would "like" to be updated.  And have a special value for "never" or "stop"<p>

Something like:<p>

[update]
[interval value="1" units="hours"]
[/update]
or
[update interval="stop"]<p>

And that way channels that are not super updated often can lower themselves on the "chain" to allow other more up to date channels to get higher in the "que".<p>

Channel providers neednt follow the requested interval but might use it as a "priority level"
