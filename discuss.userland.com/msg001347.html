It would take twelve Democratic Senators to do so. <<<p>

This neatly encapsulates the whole issue for me.  The Senate will not remove him from office, because it would take 12 Democrats to do this.  Why won't the Dem's vote for removal?  The country doesn't want them to do it.  Clinton's "crimes" don't justify it.<p>

I can well believe that Bill Clinton has never considered resignation.  He knows the above as well as we do.  He doesn't have to resign, he doesn't have to accept censure, and there's nothing that the Republican House can do about it, except rail and spit.  A Senate "trial" will exonerate him.<p>

So, why does the House persist?  It's apparent that they can't embarrass him out of Office.  They can't win in the Senate. The GOP majority is (once again) damaging their own image more than his.  And once this is all over he has two years left to try and rehabilitate his image.<p>

I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  This is a Shakespearian Drama "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing".<p>

The part that makes me most angry about all of this.  The Republicans are fond of pointing out how much the Starr investigation has cost, and laying the blame at Bill Clinton's feet.  I have to ask what their salary's have cost us over the last year while they persist in this futile lunacy.  And while this drama is playing out in Washington, what important work is being left undone.  Why is Saddam Hussein so bold now?  Is it because he thinks that the American government is distracted?<p>

I wish the whole thing would just go away.<p>

Alec.
