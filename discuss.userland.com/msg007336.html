Incorporate it into the my.userland.com graphic. It will look ten times better.</i><p>

Presumably the idea is to get anti-aliasing.<p>

<i>DW: Incorporating the italic text into the graphic is not an option because it is a dynamic element, I think when you see the flip-side of the interface here you'll understand why it is this way.</i><p>

You could generate it as a dynamic image with the LibGD extension, and get anti-aliased text, which could be much easier to read in the browser (depending on the platform and settings of the browser). There's sample code for doing that from mainResponder.<p>

However, there's a performance overhead for dynamic text-image generation. I might do it for a fancy site where the aesthetics are critical, but I probably not otherwise.
