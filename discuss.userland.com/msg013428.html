one animated & set to run just once, and the other identical to the first frame of the animation but not animated, and then to have a script that exchanges one gif for another.<p>

i have the following script:<p>

this in the head:
<SCRIPT language="JavaScript">
<!--
if (document.images) &#123;
  var myImg=new Image()
  myImg.src="anim.gif"
&#125;
<a href="//">//</a> -->
</SCRIPT><p>

and this in the body at the relevant place:
<img src="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/non-anim.gif" onClick="this.src=myImg.src"><p>

but when i try it out i find that clicking on the non-animated gif makes it jump to the final frame of the animated gif - unless i hit refresh & then click on the gif really quickly in which case i see the tail end of the animation running. it's as if my browser is loading both the animated & the non-animated gifs at the same time & running the animated gif in the background immediately. i need to find a way of making the animation wait for a mouseclick before it runs.<p>

any suggestions anyone has would be most appreciated.
