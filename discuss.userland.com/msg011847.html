These sites  toss up a bunch of ads, and can probably be paid to prioritize the results. Ebay sellers pay for such rankings, if meta-auctions screw this up, sellers don't buy, and e-bay gets less. <p>

Ebay should not mind if individual users do searches. That's what users do. Sherlock is not a crawler, it's a meta-search interface. Any site that has a search button can set up a custom sherlock plug-in. 
Rather than do a block, ebay will do a custom sherlock shopping plug in. If it does not, then they lose an audience, and that's not what they want.
