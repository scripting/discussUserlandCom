It's surprisingly relevant. A parable on scalability.....<p>

Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two of his advisors for a test.<p>

He showed them both a shiny metal box with two slots in the top, a
control knob, and a lever. "What do you think this is?"<p>

 One advisor, an Electrical Engineer, answered first. "It is a toaster," he said.<p>

The king asked, "How would you design an embedded computer for it?"<p>

The advisor: "Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write a simple
program that reads the darkness knob and quantifies its position to one
of
16 shades of darkness, from snow white to coal black. The program would
use
that darkness level as the index to a 16-element table of initial timer
values. Then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer
with
the initial value selected from the table. At the end of the time delay,
it
would turn off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and
I'll
show you a working prototype."<p>

The second advisor, a IT consultant, immediately recognized the
danger of such short-sighted thinking.
He said, "Toasters don't just turn bread into toast, they are also used
to
warm frozen waffles. What you see before you is really a breakfast food
cooker. As the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they
will
demand more capabilities. They will need a breakfast food cooker that
can
also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled eggs. A toaster that
only
makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don't look to the future, we
will
have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years."<p>

"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the
problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class
into subclasses: grains, pork, and poultry. The specialization process
should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes,
and
waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry
divided
into scrambled eggs, hard- boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and
various omelette classes."<p>

"The ham and cheese omelette class is worth special attention because it
must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes.
Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple
inheritance. At run time, the program must create the proper object and
send
a message to the object that says, 'Cook yourself.' The semantics of
this
message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a
different
meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs."<p>

"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has
revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast
food.
In the design phase, we have discovered some derived requirements.
Specifically, we need an object-oriented language with multiple
inheritance.
Of course, users don't want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is
frying,
so concurrent processing is required, too."<p>

"We must not forget the user interface. The lever that lowers the food
lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing. Users won't buy
the
product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface. When the
breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on the
screen. Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v.8.3' appears
on
the screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product gets to the
market.) Users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to
cook."<p>

"Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the
design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform
for
the implementation phase. An Intel Pentium with 48MB of memory, a 1.2GB
hard
disk, and a SVGA monitor should be sufficient. If you select a
multitasking,
object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a
built-in GUI, writing the program will be a snap."<p>

The king wisely had the IT consultant beheaded, and they all lived
happily ever after.
