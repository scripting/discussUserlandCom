So if you get disconnected, just reconnect and you're right where you left off.  Or disconnect and reconnect from home, and everything's right where you left it.<p>

I didn't test desktop.com to see if this is true for them (if the entire thing is rendered in Javascript on the client I would expect that at least you'd lose the last changes you made after you lost the connection), but it's obviously a significant advantage for the user.<p>

In VNC, when the net connection goes, so does the VNC window (BANG!).  So you really can't type in the window after the connection is lost.
