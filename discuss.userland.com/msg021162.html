With all due respect, I don't think so, since I don't see the consideration in both directions.  A contract has necessary conditions that must be met.  At least this is my weak layman's grasp.<p>

When you and I have a contract, both of us get something.  Normally this is made explicit.  But it might be implicit if it seems obvious to a reasonable person.  (Yes, I'm nearly making this up.)
