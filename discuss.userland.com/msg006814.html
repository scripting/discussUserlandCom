That would trouble me.<p>


<b>What I like with the discuss group storage format:</b>
<ol>
<li>Attributes are stored in a more orderly and accessable manner than with the traditional attribute style.
<li>It's so close to xml that translating to and from xml should be trivial and quick.
<li>Content is kept in one gdb, looks in another and code in a third (well, the separation between the last two is not 100%). This makes an excellent base for support and work organisation.
</ol><p>

<b>What I don't like</b>
<ol>
<li>While site structure is represented (parent of a node is in "inResponseTo" and children in "responses"), this representation is much weaker than the traditional Frontier hierarchy.
<li>Attributes can only be set to documents, not to catalogs, making the detailed controll over subtrees that we are used to, realy hard to obtain.
<li>Instead of 'natural' urls, that reflects site hierarch, we get the anonymous $number-urls. This is un-nielsen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (I am aware that it's possible to make a traditional hierarchic interface of the discuss.root data. But I think it would require a lot of work, make a complicated structure, and be hard to combine with dynamic serving.)
</ol><p>

Then again, I may have missunderstod this. Maybe there is possibilites within this format that I've yet to see. I'm curious about what Manila will bring.</br></li></li></li></li></li></li>
