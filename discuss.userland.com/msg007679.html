Out of curisoty, have you been there? No? Me neither. Therefore, I'm pretty sure it's unreasonable for you to argue that it's "easy" (just as much as it'd be unreasonable for me to suggest that it isn't).<p>

There -is- a worldwide network of reliable and inexpensive access points. The problem is that no one, on the whole, writes about them unless they are part of some rich-man's grand startup scheme to create a stale and sterile chain. All over the world, small business people, community groups, etc, etc, are running cybercafes. But much as people tend to pay attention to, or the media create attention for Barnes & Noble instead of Lucy's Backroom Bookshop, or Starbucks over Lucy's Java Nook, or Wal-Mart instead of Lucy's Corner Store, now people only "buy into" the cybercafe concept if it's some Big Business strategy.<p>

To hell with that. If people are so hungry for access when they travel, support the little guy who has been doing it for longer, and who does it out of a sense of purpose, mission, or philosophy. I really just fail to understand why corporate endeavors seem to be so much more important and deserving of support than simple human ones.<p>
