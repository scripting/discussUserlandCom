Have another look at the <A HREF="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/license/">licence agreement</A> for <A HREF="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</A>, which states:<p>

This makes a lot of things possible.<p>

<b>Dictionary with Definitions</b><p>

The WordNet database is available in a "Prolog-readable" format that is basically a text file, and can be converted reasonably easily into a Frontier db. (I've written a script to do this, but it's in 5.0.2-era code.)<p>

Apart from the obvious utility of having instant access to 50,000+ words, the WordNet database has another benefit: definitions.<p>

The definitions stricture is terrific. In the main wordlist, each word is assigned a number which corresponds to a definition, stored in a different file. It also stores info on each word's synonym set, etc. (Everything that the online WordNet does.)<p>

At a simple level the wordlist can be converted to a lookup table. (It's about 4.7MB) The definition number can also be stored with each word. If the definitions list is also converted to a separate db, you get a powerful online dictionary. Smart cookies could no doubt figure out a way to reduce the size of the lookup table.<p>

I haven't gotten far with the implementation of definitions yet (I'm using the quirky db verbs directly!), but as a spellchecking lookup table it works fine.<p>

Other, specialised dictionaries could be created using the same format. (I have a medical wordlist, but haven't converted it yet.)<p>

<b>Spellchecking Interfaces</b><p>

The most difficult part of this process is the spellchecking routine itself. For me the process is complicated because the WordNet dictionary is in US-English, and I write in the Queen's English, so my spellchecking routine needs a "UK English" flag and a set of rules for converting -ize to -ise etc.<p>

I'm sure the community will develop lots of interfaces, though. For instance it would be possible to create a web interface that turns each misspelled word into a drop-down box of suggestions.<p>

Of course, all interfaces would have to include WordNet's copyright notice.<p>

<b>The Suggestions Theory</b><p>

Suggested words is the hardest bit. Creating an algorithm for finding suggestions is well beyond my capabilities, so I've tried a different tack: keeping a table of misspelled words together with the corrected words, and maintaining a set of "auto-correct" words for common typos ("hte" -> "the" etc.).<p>

The system I'm toying with will pop up a dialog box when it finds a mispelled word, including a suggestion in the edit field. If a misspelling is replaced with a particular suggestion repeatedly, it becomes an auto-correction.<p>

<b>The Community Spellchecker</b><p>

A powerful way to implement this would be to allow the users of the spell-checker to contribute their suggestion lists to a central db, which could combine them. This would be the fastest way for the suggestion feature to develop.
