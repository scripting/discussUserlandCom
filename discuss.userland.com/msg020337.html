It can be used to edit text that will be used on a web page (with HTML tags) or by a programmer to write code in any number of programming languages.  It in fact has built-in color coding of keywords for Assembly , C, C++, Fortran, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Pascal, Perl, Tcl, and TeX.  Most Mac IDEs allow the use of BBEdit instead of the built-in editor.  Since the market for Mac developers is rather small and probably most of them already have BBEdit, Bare Bones Software has added HTML support to expand the market for their editor  to include web developers as well.  BBEdit provides updates quite regularly to the program and is known to be working on a major revision right now.
