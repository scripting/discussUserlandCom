<i>After seeing Oracle enter the application service provider (ASP) business, it was only a matter of time before asset and content-management vendors began to take the database vendor's lead. Earlier this month Vignette announced that its partner, Breakaway, has begun hosting StoryServer as an ASP. Now the latest: Arbortext (<a href="http://www.arbortext.com">http://www.arbortext.com</a>) announced Tuesday its own ASP offering, called Extend. Extend sets its own precedent: It will be the first XML-based content-management software that you can deploy on an ASP basis. </i><p>
