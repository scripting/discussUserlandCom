Perhaps on the RSS-dev list but there has been substantial discussion about the RSS format on the syndication list. Including many comments from people that don't like the new changes.<p>

I understand that you may be trying to isolate your comments to the RSS-dev list but I think its rather important that you at least admit that there has been discussions elsewhere and it hasn't all been positive.
