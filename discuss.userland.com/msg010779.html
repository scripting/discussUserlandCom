XML (and scriptingnews/rdf) has made a standard for syndication, but who's gonna make that magic bullet, that little bit of code that leads to EASY syndication? <p>

I'd like to think it would be a bit of javascript that could parse XML. It's almost universal, easy to implement, and doesn't require any server side modification.<p>

Just some code. Anyone?
