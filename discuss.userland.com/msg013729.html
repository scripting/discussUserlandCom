We are working extensively on WAP services/apps for the European market. Checkout the URL below;<p>

<a href="http://www.onfone.cwcs.net/wap/index.cgi">http://www.onfone.cwcs.net/wap/index.cgi</a><p>

The URL above returns a WML deck which contains links to two services;<p>

'QXL Onfone' - A working prototype that delivers WAP access to the European QXL auction site (a little like eBay). All access to QXL is in realtime with the returned WML decks being built on the fly via the public QXL web site. This version only allows you to browse a limited range of auctions and does not support bid monitoring via SMS or the ability to 'up' your bid from your WAP phone. The version we have in development will support all of these enhanced features.<p>

'Train Times-Onfone' - Again a working prototype that provides mobile access to the UK national rail timetable via the Railtrack Web site(RailTrack operate physical rail network as opposed to the trains themselves in the UK). The service allows you to enter the 'from' and 'to' stations and the 'time' and 'date' and will return up to 4 suggested trains for that particular journey. We are working on an enhanced version of this WAP service that will remove the current requirement to type the complete station name on the mobile phones key pad and will also allow you to purchase train tickets.<p>

All the WAP services we have in development are leveraging Internet facing content and technologies - dynamically enabling that content to be delivered to a mass market pocket sized device. Today those devices are only just appearing on resellers shelves but by this time next year they will be everywhere with all the mobile phone manufacturers saying that they will have WAP in every mobile phone they manufacture. By this time next year there will be in excess of 220 million mobile phones in use across Europe - with 15-20% of those being WAP enabled. That's a big market - a market that is growing at a phenomenal rate.<p>

If you want to see the services in operation then download the WAP SDK from Nokia's Web site (includes a simulation of a real phone) at <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/">http://www.forum.nokia.com/</a>.<p>
