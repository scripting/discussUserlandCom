It represents a significant body of prior art for web-based collaboration systems.<p>

Wiki is well suited to unstructured collaboration, or small group collaboration where structure can be enforced by a disciplined team. All Wiki pages are editable (save for pages that are generated dynamically, such as search results), and structure evolves as people add or remove links. Instances of Wiki have been used by small groups to write papers and books. I've set up Wikis on intranets for internal use, with mixed success.<p>

Ward's original Wiki (<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki</a>) is also an ongoing experiment in how on-line communities form, evolve, and sometimes splinter and restructure.<p>

The Perl source code for Wiki is available, and editable, through Wiki itself. Some in Wiki community have been contributing to that codebase for several years, and it's inspired a number Wiki "clones" in several languages. See <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiClones">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiClones</a> for a partial list.
