I just ran the "self-healer" application again, and it's installing things at the extension level ... a whole mess of files in a folder called "MS Library Folder". I just checked out their file types, though, and they're all "shlb"'s. Don't suppose shared libraries are doing anything malicious ... ?!? There's also an Active X Control from the installer showing the same creation date.<p>

Or maybe it's at the Finder level. Does this new MS software make, say, Apple Event calls that MSIE 4.01 doesn't? Seems reasonable that a Mac-only version might make that step. If someone who's a little more proficient with CaptureAE than I could root this out, that would be great.<p>

I'd really like to eliminate Frontier from this equation, but I can't yet. I've got two people here with nothing in common except these two programs and we're still gumming up for no discernable reason.<p>

Anyone who actually worked on this software and could give a sense of what was different from MSIE's last iteration, I'd be much obliged ...
