That's how you should start. And render the pages, look for macro errors, and iterate until your pages build without errors.<p>

There's a lot of information on migrating from 4 to 5 on the Frontier <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/titlesearch$migratingfromfrontier4">site</a>.<p>

Re your #2, Andre will help you with that. If you could say where you hit errors that would be helpful. And there are a bunch of other people who have gotten it working, I think, I hope they chime in and help you out.<p>

It's great that you've decided to get back in the loop. I think you'll like what you see. There's been a lot of improvement since 4.2.
