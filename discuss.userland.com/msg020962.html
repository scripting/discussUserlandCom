I would like to use the macro facilities to enable some level of security.  The problem is, it seems that macros are pretty severely restricted on those two services. <p>

The macro "whoAmI" seems to work fine.  <p>

The macro "hierarchyPath" returns null, even when the page it is used on is defined in the "Site Structure" advanced preferences.<p>

I saw a description of a macro that would enable other macros, but I haven't been able to get that to work either.  Any help?<p>

Thanks,
Webb
