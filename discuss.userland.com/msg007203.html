I'm not sure about that one. I know it runs on dual-CPU machines, we have three of them here. But does it run better than six single-CPU machines? I don't know.<p>

The last one I bought was over $6K. I could have bought a few 450Mhz machines for that money. No, I don't think it was a good buy. But I don't have the data to back up that opinion.
