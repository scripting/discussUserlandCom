Welcome to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11257">Nick Arnett</a>, the VP Marketing of Invisible Worlds. I've known Nick since the early days of the Mac. This is excellent.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11252">Naval Ravikant</a> of epinions responds to questions raised in my tour of their site last weekend. "We can use our system to build a dynamic weblog, in which anyone on the net can submit a link and commentary on any given day. Then, when you come to the site, your trusted weblog is automatically built according to your trusted weblog-maintainer list. Such a dynamic weblog is custom-tailored for each individual and doesn't require each weblog author to write every day."<p>

Mr. Ravikant was an early contributor to Scripting News. His comments top the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/mail/mail970806.html">Mail Page</a> for 8/6/97. This counts for a lot here! He's a great writer, has a strong opinion, and doesn't mind sharing it. Thanks man.<p>

The XML-RPC <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/xml-rpc/">mail list</a> is having a minor identity crisis. Should it be broad or focused? I voted in favor of making it broad. SOAP *is* a form of XML-RPC. I want to stay in touch with the people who are working on this stuff, and don't want to subscribe to a different mail list for each protocol.
