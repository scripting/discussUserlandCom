I completely agree with Dave A's thoughts. As I recently wrote in an email: <p>

"The Vignette business model is: Take bigtime advantage of stupid people in large corporations with lots of money and legacy data stuck in an Oracle database.  That's what Site2 wanted to do, too. In some ways, that's what the
company I work for wants to do (see <a href="http://www.ptc.com/products/windchill/collaboration/ds_foundation.htm">http://www.ptc.com/products/windchill/collaboration/ds_foundation.htm</a>). That's
part of why I am so interested in Frontier and Manila. I want to show  the world that one person can get a GOOD content management site up and running in Frontier with very little effort and at very little cost. If  I can add version control and some workflow, I'm there!"<p>
