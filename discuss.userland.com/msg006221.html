is, to say, the least, premature, since the dynamics of, say
the Darwin open source community, or a unified Linux desktop
haven't had time to develop.<p>

If Linux really became all that, Apple could probably polish MkLinux (Mach is important) and throw the various frameworks on top of that. Apple would still sell its hardware. The NeXT hands at Apple certainly have experience in porting their frameworks to other OSes. But again, this possibility is going to be pretty remote for a while.<p>

The mere momentum of Linux isn't a reason to adopt it. It has to
fit with the rest of your mission and your development history.
I think that the performance of Linux as a server is a safe bet,
but it has not proven itself as a good substrate for end-user
applications that integrate with each other. (Example:
so the gimp is good, but what can it talk to ? Can I even print
an image to a non-Postscript printer from Linux ?)
I don't see why Apple would switch when they've
already got years of experience (thanks to NeXT)
with respected open source tools and OSes
-- Darwin is essentially a Free/Open/NetBSD enhancement--
and there are plenty of people who feel that these *BSDs are just
as good if not better than Linux, at least for certain tasks.
Also, these *BSDs don't experience
the version churn that the front-line of the Linux kernel does,
and stability is required for any foundation of a
complex software system such as MacOS X.<p>

Another thing to keep in mind is that userland (heh-heh) Linux
tools tend to be portable to other Unices, including BSD, so
it's not like MacOS X would be left out of the party if some
open-source Linux "killer app," which would very likely not be
an end-user application, came along.<p>

You really ought to investigate the idea of a Frontier runtime --
you'd be forced to deal with modularity issues, and that core
(excluding OS-specific application connection support)
could probably stick mostly to C library and POSIX APIs, which
would fit NT, Linux and all MacOS X variants quite nicely. It might
make things run faster, but it would take up less memory and
disk space.<p>

You might find it interesting that the Mathematica folks, when porting
to Carbon, decided to simply make the Carbonized (MacOS) UI code
talk to their engine, running in the 4.4 BSD system, over pipes.
It's pretty neat and combines the use of the good, proven UI with
workhorse code that pretty much only needs generic services from
the OS.
