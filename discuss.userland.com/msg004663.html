The refresh is just of a layer and just of a javascript variable that indicates a lastModified.  That value is monitored by another script that will request new content as it is indicated.<p>

The changes are probably stored in a queue (thanks, Seth) in a Frontier table, but the net effect of changes is also put into an outline that can be rendered with anything, e.g. "docRenderer", so the clients can be looking at a dynamic outline and a rendered HTML page with tables, images, etc.<p>

Other tools are also do-able within Javascript.<p>
