Sadly, I will not have the time to stay in synch with the Frontier progress because I will be doing travel big time.<p>

My last few months working at home in my business has been made very tolerable because of the activities surrounding this Frontier online community. I have learned a lot from contributors and new ways of using Frontier.<p>

I hope to make my website on my external server, responder-ready before my free time is up. That way I can really feel a sense of accomplishment and be a  better promoter of Frontier to the folks I'll meet on my new journeys.<p>
