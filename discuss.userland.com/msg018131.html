Right now there are a lot of different ways to chat, they're all reasonably straightforward, and all different.<p>

Is Jabber the one we should support?<p>

I don't know enough about chat to know.<p>

However, if there were a common SOAP or XML-RPC interface for chat, supported by one or more servers, we'd be happy to implement it. And we'd probably implement a server-side as well.<p>

So whether it happens on its own or not depends on how the chat vendors perceive these relatively new technologies.
