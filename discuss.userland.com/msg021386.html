Let's not overlook the excellence that has come from open source.<p>

This is a many-month process, to take down the wall, step by step, by peering over the wall and saying "this is what I see" and waiting for a response.<p>

On the FoRK list, a response called me a "closed source" developer. My response was "The shoe don't fit". I release a lot of source. I asked if we could stop putting labels on each other. That's an important step. Put labels on yourself, and choose them with care.<p>

Now, about Frontier as open source, of course I'm thinking about it as this discussion goes forward. That's why I'm having the discussion. I could never move into open source boldly without having my philosophical bag cleaned up and sorted and presented.<p>

MacBird was a trial-run. A learning experience. And it isn't over yet. I think of it this way, Frontier, properly presented, could be the biggest mind bomb ever to hit the software world. So much developed <i>relevant</i> technology that few outside our little world understand. But I would never release it as open source if I didn't think there would be a big payoff for our shareholders, users, developers and partners.
