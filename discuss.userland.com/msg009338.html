know that !!!</i><p>

Technically, you are right.<p>

However, why the modern calendar starts at 1. A.D. and not 0 A.D. is a mystery to me. It's was a completely arbritary date start and responsible for many 1-off date misconceptions. :-)<p>

As far as I'm concerned, the year 2000 is a new century, millenium, etc. Just make a 'fix' adjustment as has occurred with other calendar systems of the past.<p>

Of course, we could start over as Internet Year 0, or Swatch Year 0, or something else at 01/01/2000. After all, Time is relative. ;-)
