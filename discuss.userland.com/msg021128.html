In true open source style, I set up a program to send me emails, since Dave didn't want to. It uses some HTML->ASCII code that I've worked quite a bit on and is, IMHO, rather nice. It deals properly with things like italics and bold as well as H1-H6 and places links at the bottom of the message. Messages are sent out every fifteen minutes.<p>

Please send your comments to me! And enjoy!<p>
