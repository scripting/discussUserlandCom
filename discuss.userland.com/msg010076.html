I read that piece when it was very new, and found nothing in
it that didn't really apply to any small software company.
Lots of stuff like 'involve your customers,' 'listen to what
they say,' 'try to create tools that are useful also in
unexpected ways,' etc.  Nothing new there, really.<p>

But reading it again, it has changed.  Back then, I thought
it discussed GNU vs. Linux.  not 'the commercial world' vs.
'open source.'<p>

Weird.  I wonder if I have an old hardcopy somewhere...
