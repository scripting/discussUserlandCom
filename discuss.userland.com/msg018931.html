As a result one of two things had to happen -- either Scriptics retains complete control and there would be really slow movement, or the company would have to give up some control and then movement could (presumably, this still remains to be proven by actual things happening) happen faster.<p>

Since apparently they're not making money on Tcl itself, yet its a big financial drain in terms of engineering, SQE etc, they apparently decided to give up control.<p>

Is that the background you were missing?
