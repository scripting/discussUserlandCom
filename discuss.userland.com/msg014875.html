it is really very funny how you react to foreign language. Believe me, there are also lots of english words that sound quite funny to foreign language speakers.<p>

As for the german language TV, it is quite sad that they seem to believe that they can not have any unique ideas of their own and that they have to recycle american shows. So the game in Germany is: Who is the first to copy the latest smash hit US show. Really sad. You should watch the german copies of Late Night Show and Letterman: Pityful.<p>

As for the machine guns: Here is something even more scary: Swiss men are all enlisted for life in the Swiss army. They are required by law to keep their machine guns and ammunition at home! Most houses have bunkers in them which the Swiss are required by law to keep stocked with supplies and emergency equipment. Rumours have it that you could walk from north to south of Switzerland by never leaving the bunker systems they dug beneath their mountains.<p>

And: two or three years ago, the swiss military air traffic control issued an official report about UFO sightings (by that same air traffic control).<p>

The Swiss are a really interesting people.<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
