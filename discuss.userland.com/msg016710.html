I don't know if this is an issue for anyone else, but I want to use XML feeds (eg the weblogMonitor at <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a>) on my homepage, but I don't like increasing the server load of the provider by grabbing this XML more than about once an hour. I want it more than once an hour (okay, I'm greedy).<p>

It would be good if there were a distributed syndication system, like Usenet, so I could hit a local server once a minute and not feel guilty.<p>

<b>Does a system like that exist?</b><p>

I don't think so, so I've written up what's required and my proposal for a simple system to distribute newsfeeds.<p>

You can find it at <a href="http://interconnected.org/notes/syndication.html"><a href="http://interconnected.org/notes/syndication.html">http://interconnected.org/notes/syndication.html</a></a><p>

<b>Comments please</b><p>

I value the opinion of people on this DG and would be pleased if I could have your comments about this new system. If you feel I would be best served by taking this thread elsewhere, please just let me know.<p>

<b>And now, a joke</b><p>

As a thankyou, a quick joke: Two parrots are standing on a perch. One turns to the other and says 'Can you smell fish?'
