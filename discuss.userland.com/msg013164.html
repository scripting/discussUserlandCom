I definately agree. I am very concerned about this very issue. There are some inclusions that seem to make sense, like a date element for each item, but some others, like a stock symbol, that don't apply as much.<p>

However, there are several issues that I'm concerned about:<BR>
<li>That the RSS spec continue to evolve in a useful manner.
<li>That the RSS spec remain simple
<li>That a concensus is reached on a recommended method of extending the format, while maintaining backward compatibility.<p>

I'm really concerned about the last item. I agree that adding arbitrary elements could be a very bad thing for the wide acceptance of the format. <p>

While you can't validate the elements you import via a namespace with a regular validating parser (as Ken noted), it is a good way to sematically separate the core RSS elements from the ones that are local to a particular use. Another advantage to using namespaces is that it reduces the possibility of namespace clashes if everyone starts extending RSS. So, as Ken mentioned, you could have:<BR>
<userland:category><BR>
<motleyfool:category><BR>
in the same file and the RSS core still remains intact.
