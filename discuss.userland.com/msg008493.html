I just didnt understand the flow, that's all. You're right, I didn't realize that the weblogs themselves wouldn't draw readership, that my.userland.com would be the place where people read my contributions. Cool.<p>

And: Of course you exercise editorial control over Scripting News. Wasn't arguing with that. I was just nonplussed by the fact that previously you had highlighted there new channels that are off-site as you added them, and hadn't done that for hosted channels. Just a confusion, that's all.
