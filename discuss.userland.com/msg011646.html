On the other hand, there was a popular song back in the 1890s called "Who Put the Overalls in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder". I don't recall all the words, but here's the core of the tale:<p>

<i>
When Mrs. Murphy dished the chowder out<br>
She fainted on the spot.<br>
She'd found a pair of overalls<br>
At the bottom of the pot.
</i><p>

and<p>

<i>
When Mrs. Murphy she came to<br>
She began to cry and pout<br>
She'd had them in the was that day<br>
Forgot to take them out
</i><p>

Perhaps it hadn't yet been formalized, but Murphy's Law was definitely in effect long before Edward A. Murphy, Jr.!<p>
