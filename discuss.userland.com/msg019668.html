You're one smart dude Zac.<p>

Yeah, of course we're going to do that. And it's a total loop close. In 1982 I did a BBS that wasn't very unlike this DG. On the backend it was ThinkTank. You could open the BBS database in ThinkTank. I remember showing that to a younger Bernie DeKoven and have him fall off his chair. It's about time, isn't it?<p>

I'm doing something similar tonight, but not exactly that. It's a web of outlines. It'll be less democratic than a threaded DG in an outliner, more like a weblog in an outline. Imagine, instead of clicking on a link to read a story you're pointing to, you 2click on the wedge and the story just expands underneath the headline.<p>

I bet the Moreover guys will like that. And I gather that Blogger is going XML too, so it should be possible to browse their stuff that way too. They'll work with me eventually, I'll keep making offers eventually they'll say yes.
