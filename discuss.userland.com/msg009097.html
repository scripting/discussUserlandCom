"a chainsaw is a tool for cutting down trees and chopping up large blocks of wood, and you can use it to slice a watermelon."<p>

sure you can use a chainsaw to slice up some delicious watermelon, but thats not an acurate description of what a chainsaw is or its intended use.<p>

also, evaluating software as the end result doesnt really tell you how great the tool they used to get there was. programming is an art, and good art can be made from useless garbage.<p>

to me open source is a tool for learning, teaching, sharing and giving back to the world freely.<p>

now who elected this Raymond guy anyways?
