People tend to forget this but the broadcast industry has to face the same problems since the sixties. They have to produce content the expensive way. But they can`t sell it because radio- and tv-products are commodities everyone expects to get for free. <p>

This gave birth to a completely new industry - i call it the awareness-business. You don`t sell the product anymore you sell the awareness a product generates. <p>

Thats the way to go and it is not new, definitely.
The money follows the awareness!!! ( Wow that sounds strange )<p>
