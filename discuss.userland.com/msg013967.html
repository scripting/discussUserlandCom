Before going there, you can get a lot of information about the develoment of the internet in the continent, reading (or even subscribing!) to <A HREF="http://www.francophonie.org/liaison/">Liaison Francophone</A>. We have regular contributing editors from Senegal, Mauritius, Morocco, Tunisia, and news from others countries. It started in 1997.<p>

The news are in French but as it is in your discipline, it shouldn't be too difficult to read. Some news points to English site also.<p>
