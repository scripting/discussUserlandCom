In the online world, "intentional" has just been used as a blanket descriptor, to distinguish from the offline world where your community comes with your choice of housing location, which isn't much of a real choice. The early online communities may have been more attractive to you simply because their smaller size and more narrow psychographic population made them better at managing a culture... (And it might be worth noting that having higher online access costs in those days was perhaps another way of limiting noise. Perhaps you should charge people for the right to post...)
