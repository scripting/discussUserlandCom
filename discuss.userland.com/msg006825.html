1. I do believe it is always spelled with one L.<p>

2. And the proper pronounciation does NOT rhyme with vanilla. Maybe in American parlance, but given the very international nature of the internet, perhaps some sensitivity would be nice. The correct pronounciation is MAH-nee-lah, with the middle syllable actually sounding a lot like 'knee'. <p>

Anyway, I don't mean to sound off like an overly sensitive zealot - just wanted to pitch my two cents in....
