I think Bill identifies himself with Microsoft. An attack on Microsoft is an attack on him. Many people who are attacked fight back, or get defensive. It takes a very mature person to listen and acknowledge that what was done is wrong. And frankly, we live in a society where less and less people have that maturity.<p>

What we need are people who are real friends of Bill to help him come to terms with this. Do you know Warren Buffet?
