There's not that much to it.<p>

1. Create a new outline.<p>

2. Enter XML text.<p>

Then, the next question is, what do you want to do with the XML text?<p>

<b>An idea</b><p>

We might try a little project together. How about rewriting the <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/macros/navbar">navbar macro</a> so that it accepted a navbar in XML?<p>

The advantage would be it would render much more quickly, which is important for dynamic sites. An example, the DaveNet <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/">site</a>.<p>

What would we call this macro? xNavBar?
