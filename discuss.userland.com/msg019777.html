The future does not exist. The philosophers, being weird, are arguing like this: The entire history of the universe exists. The entire population of the human species beginning to end, exists. Your consciousness gets randomly dropped into one of those human beings.<p>I agree with you, but there is one point in their favor: Einstein agrees with them. General relativity says space and time are equivalent, and all of space-time is one big static structure. (Quantum physics doesn't necessarily agree, but it's hard to say because no one agrees on what quantum physics means.)
