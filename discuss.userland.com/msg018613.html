In
the paragraph about the misogynistic letters, he's referring to "...a nut
job whose Web site reports on the goings-on in the world of technology,
offering up a rare stew of fantasy and paranoia that would make a Lyndon
LaRouche blush." No way he's talking about you there. He refers to you as "a
self-described Web journalist.... who holds down a day job as a software
developer" and his "new pen pal." In fact, with the first sentence under
"The conspiracy buffs," he is explicitly contrasting you with the "nut job"
who sends the misogynistic messages.
