I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but you might want to check into <a href="http://soa.granitecanyon.com/">The Public DNS Service</a>. To quote from their site:<p>

<ul>The Public DNS is useful if you: <p>

       <li>Can't get free service from an ISP and don't want to do it yourself 
       <li>Need secondary DNS servers 
       <li>Need MX records for a virtual domain 
       <li>Want control over your DNS records: change DNS frequently, changing ISPs soon 
       <li>Are inside of a firewall and need publicly-accessible name servers outside of your firewall 
       <li>Need name servers that are closer to the North American Internet backbones 
</ul><p>

And, it's free. OTOH, I've never used the service, so YMMV.</blockquote></li></li></li></li></li></li>
