On the Weblogs mail list, I posted a message about the future of My.UserLand. "One can easily convert our affiliate software to Perl, Tcl, Java, etc, and we would support that."<p>

BackEnd: My.UserLand XML files and archives. These are the files that the new My.UserLand reads.

When the affiliate2.root code was released back in December, I wrote a Java implementation called, <a href="http://barista.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$17">JAffiliate</a> which would go the currentStories.xml file, download it and create the necessary sub-files for the individual syndicate id's.  It doesn't use a db to store the info but physical XML files.  This will change in the future (or you can change it yourself, since the source is included).<p>

This isn't just a plug since I have a question.  Would the service4.xml file be the 'best' place to find out how the id's map to the web sites?  If that's not the right place, then I could probably just have a Hashtable created which keeps track of the id and the site name.<p>
