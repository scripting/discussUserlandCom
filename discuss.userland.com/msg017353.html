That's not at all obvious from the tagline at the bottom.  <p>

I may be jumping on the Globe a little hard for me not recognizing counsel in that lawsuit, but in an era when anytime MSNBC reports on Microsoft they mention the blindingly obvious MS==microsoft, this is irresponsible journalisim. <p>

This is an article (not clearly marked as an opinion piece, it's in the business section) about the defense of copyright in a highly contentious case only marginally related to copyright and they don't mention that the author is a primary party in the lawsuit. The author is not a public figure with instant name recognition (i.e. Greenspan, Clinton) and is simply identified with the following:<p>

<i>Irwin B. Schwartz is managing partner of Schwartz and Nystrom</i><p>

If this were in the Wall Street Journal, the lines following the article would have stated that the author was primary counsel for Mattel. <p>
