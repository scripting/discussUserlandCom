This makes me wounder if one factor could be that Frontier has to "open" every image to read the height and width of it? <p>

This seams to be values that could be cached. <p>

So I have a suggestion:<p>

Reform the #images table the same way #glossary was reformed. Introduce a new format where an image is a table. One cell is the binary image data. Other cells are used to cache the height and width after the first time they are sampled. As in #glossary the old format with one binary cell/image is still suported, for backwards compability.<p>

This could have other advantages also. For example, I would most of the time prefer to store the alt-text together with the image, instead of in the html-code. Same thing with lowsrc and probably some other attributes. (And the rule could be that if an attribute is set in imageRef it overrides an attribute in the #image table.)
