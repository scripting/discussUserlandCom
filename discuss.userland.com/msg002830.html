This points up an ongoing need for a RPC registry, much like the old (failed) AppleEvent registry that Apple sponsored for about 6 months. I could envision even something as simple as a variation on these discussion forums where RPC authors can post method names, arguments, expected behaviors, a link to a test server, etc. At least there would be one place to look for info on existing, public RPCs.
