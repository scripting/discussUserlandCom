<ul>
<li>Updating Manila.root: I have been unable to update my copy of manila.root for the last two days, trying many times, at different times of the day, to no luck. (This was both as part of the nightly update and using Main -> Update Manila.Root)<br><br>I get the following windows message box error:<br>Can't update the root because "Can't read stream because TCP/IP error code 10060 - Connection time out.."'<br>This caused be no end of grief, as I am using a 'Full Install' download from your support site of version 6.1.1. Some of my sites were set up to support Pike, and as this update isn't included in the full install yet.
<br>(The other roots all updated fine)<br>
<br>I have kind of worked around this by using another copy of manila.root from another of my servers, that seems to be more recently updated, but this leads me to my next problem...<p>

<li>Trying to submit any of my pages - new or updated discussion items, or admin screens, leads to the following error:
<br><br>Sorry! There was an error: Can't post this page because the referer did not match the expected referer. 
The error was detected by Frontier 6.1.1 in mainResponder.respond. Webmaster: <a href="mailto:bend@centaur.co.uk">bend@centaur.co.uk</a>. Time: Wed, 17 May 2000 17:30:38 GMT. 
<br><br>how can my referer have changed since the page was requested? The irony is that this copy of frontier is running on my machine. the one I'm requesting (and writing and submiting this page from).
</ul><p>

Are these two related?<p>

Please help :)<p>

<p>

 - btw do you update the zip files on the downloads page?
