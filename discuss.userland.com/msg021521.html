<p>
Well, the system is not very intellectual if it thinks there is a one true way.  I mean, if you figured it out, how can you imagine that other smart people have not figured it out?  Leave software out of it, and pay attention to the analogy about debt and lending.  The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.  This is how it is and how it always will be.  No amount of postulating on the part of anyone will change that.  Griping about salt is missing the point and once again getting a bit too sensitive about what could be a good discussion.
