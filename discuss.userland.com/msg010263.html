Hmm.. that could be it.  I'll admit that I haven't found many big name vendors offering Celerons.  Quite a few small vendors do, though.  I came across one awhile back called "ComputerNerd USA" that is shooting for the server market.  When I checked last, they had a Dual Celeron 366 o/c to 550 with 512M RAM for about $3K.<p>

The folks at Ars Technica did a "smackdown" between a similar box to this and a dual PIII 500 (o/c to 560).  The Celeron one was neck and neck with the PIII for nearly all of their tests.  It was <i>very</i> interesting.<p>
