I don't keep my eye on it, so I didn't know that they hadn't updated the site. They never promised to, or if they did, I don't remember. But if they still say that WebBroker is the only comparable technology to WDDX, I'd say that's misleading, incomplete and unfair to us and to their users. We do point to them from <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com">www.xmlrpc.com</a>, btw. Dave
