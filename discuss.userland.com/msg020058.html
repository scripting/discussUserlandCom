If I stumble across your directory and say "Wow I know where that fits into my directory," I put in a node into my outline that's a hyperjump. When I render my directory, the renderer grabs yours and renders it in my space, in my template, however with full credit to you when the reader is browsing in your space.<p>

Of course since your directory is on the Web, I can just point to it.<p>

But here's where it gets really sexy. Suppose there are two people keeping directories of weblogs. I like them both. I can link them both into my weblogs section and on my site it's the combination of the two. This is the rocket science part. I haven't figured out how to give proper credit in these sections, but this is how it routes around DMOZ and Yahoo, multiple editors for each category and completely distributed, and competitive. <p>

I could see 20 full web directories coming from this architecture, and thousands of micro-directories. I also think it might be a good idea for DMOZ to adopt our tool, it could probably dramatically improve the productivity of their edtiors. I would also welcome their embrace of the distributed idea.<p>

And btw, all the formats are open, and anyone can clone it. Got a better tool? More power to you.
