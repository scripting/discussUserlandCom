I like the organization.  The installation (of the upgrade) went fine & didn't break anything that I can notice yet.<p>

Comments:  1) It took me a while to find the Search button... I know you must think I'm blind,  but somehow I couldn't find it!  2) the F6 site needs more color... the big blocky "USERLAND" is awfully somber.<p>

  The docs look fine.  Mostly though,  I use the advanced search to find what I need.<p>

  I'm getting ready today to download a couple of the apps & see if I can make any progress with them.<p>


   All in all... F6 looks great.<p>
