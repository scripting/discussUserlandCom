i remember being quite underawed by the whole thing... this was back in '95... from a merely aesthetic point of view, the experience was very grey... and link rot had set in even then!...<p>

i'm sitting at home now, on a 486/50 running netscape 3 and writing this in a mail window because i can't be bothered to sit and wait and open another programme... soon i shall splash out on a new number... in the meantime... <p>

yesterday, i uploaded explorerer 5 onto the machine at work and had a squint at a few xml pages just for the thrill of it... <p>

i recently put up a neighbour of my parents who was 18... he was visiting london to do some work experience... <p>

amongst other things, i'm a dj and he had a great time playing with my records... after two days however, he asked me how to tell the difference in speed (33 vs 45) for each record... such a fundamental precept that i'd taken for granted!... he'd only known cds before...<p>

and in some circles, we are coming towards the end of the generation of ppl who can remember the first time they went on the internet... <p>

i can say that i was excited as i loaded for the first time a page rendered in xml... and i was not underwhelmed as i was on my first tryst with the world wide web...<p>

i don't understand it fully... but, like anne shulgin in <i>pihkal - a chemical love story</i> listening to her husband, alexander, talk of chemistry, i get the music...<p>

we are on the verge of a new era - if only...<p>

let's jolly waell have it! :)
