<i>Zope.Org: The Zope/Mozilla Initiative. "Zope's management environment pays for the flexibility of an 'Internet architecture' by being less productive than competitive 'thick-client' environments." Hmmm. Refreshingly honest! (We like thick clients, but we like thin ones too.)</i><p>

Right now, Mozilla is nearing an alpha release. The browser core is clean, speedy (except for the bogus reflow problem) and starting to stabilize. We should see a useable alpha within a few months, and a beta a while after that. Netscape still doesn't know how to write large applications, but they're making slow progress anyway.<p>

Mozilla already implements tons of <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3 standards</a>. Imagine those broadband DHTML apps, and you'll get the idea. Mozilla has client-side scripting, GUI widgets and the ability to munge XML. The Mozilla HTML editor, for example, is essentially a large Javascript application, as is the newsreader. What this means: If Netscape ever releases Mozilla, <i>you should finally be able to write portable applications that run in a browser.</i> There's even an improved text-editing widget.<p>

Zope's front-end is heavily web-based. It uses frames, forms and lots of <TEXTAREA> tags. This has both upsides and downsides. The upside: You can build Zope sites from anywhere. The downside: The GUI is clunky at best. To solve these problems, Digital Creations is apparently building a custom client that runs inside Mozilla.<p>

On a related note: Internet Explorer users may not miss the fun. Various Mozilla groups have created a version of Mozilla's HTML engine which can run invisibly as an ActiveX component inside IE. Talk about swallowing your pride to help developers.<p>

Of course, all this is moot if Mozilla never ships. It's looking a lot better than it was six months ago (and it's more stable than Netscape 4.7 for some users), but it's cleary not a release candidate yet.<p>

Cheers,<br>
