I just implemented this method on my server. It works! I like it...a lot. One of the advantages of this method is that it enables much shorter URLs without requiring registration of virtual domains. Specifically, it solves a problem for me with htmlInterfaces.discussionGroup. I <i>hate</i> the URL <<a href="http://myServer/htmlInterfaces/discussionGroup">http://myServer/htmlInterfaces/discussionGroup</a>>, but currently indexing discussion group messages for the search engine works only if you have the website at htmlInterfaces.discussionGroup. Now, I've got the messages stored in a root where the indexing routines expect them, but I've got my preferred URL <<a href="http://myServer/discuss/">http://myServer/discuss/</a>>. Yeah!
