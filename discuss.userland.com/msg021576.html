I don't see how the Dumbill article referenced above makes it clear that Dale is in charge.  My perception is that Dale was someone asking questions, which as I recall is an encouraged activity.<p>

The bits involving Dale:<p>

	<blockquote>This essay was originally part of an email in response to a message from Dale Dougherty asking whether RDF was important or just a dead end. The question was asked in the context of extending the RSS XML format, used to syndicate "site summary" headline information around the web. At WWW9 recently there was a spontaneous discussion about extending RSS involving Dale, Dave Winer, David Galbraith from Moreover and various others. </blockquote><p>

And:<p>

	<blockquote>Dale writes:
<i>one wonders what anyone would really do with these RDF statements. There has been lots of talk of directed graphs and visual & site maps, etc. but that seems impractical. </i></blockquote><p>

And, I guess:<p>

	<blockquote>A closing thought on why Dale says RSS "appears to be working". Is it that RSS files are simple to create? Well, yes, but only partly. HTML is a lot more complex, and an enormous amount of people create pages of reasonable complexity all the time. </blockquote><p>

Those are all the Dale references in the article.
