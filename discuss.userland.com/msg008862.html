I worked up a prototype 'story scooper' using a scripting language in PageMaker. An artist needed only place their curser in a story and start the macro. They had to type in a headline, then they were prompted for the section the story went in. The script would deposit the properly formated (Clay Basket) text file in the appropriate folder for the simple content server I made by following the above tutorial. It worked pretty well...<p>

(Thats a killer idea for a plugin for Quark or PageMaker that could expand Frontier's reach into newspaper content management... An advanced, XML aware super 'story scooper', but I digress)<p>

I have found few technologies that have allowed me to enjoy such great sucsess in such little time as Frontier.<p>

Some people get the point, and I am one of them. I say push Manila into the far corners of the net, the competition won't even see you coming.
