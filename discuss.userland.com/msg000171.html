This raises the inevitable question of when will we release the new responder, and the answer is that may take some time. <p>

We're moving more slowly and carefully these days, we want to get this right, get all the features in before it's released, and be sure we can live with the interfaces for a very long time.<p><p>BTW, you should also be able to check this out with the trial version of 5.1.4:<p><p><a href="http://www.userland.com/frontier/trial.html">http://www.userland.com/frontier/trial.html</a><p>
