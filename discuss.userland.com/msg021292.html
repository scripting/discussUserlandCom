I wish I had the stats at hand and linkable, but I think I have read that "standard" broadband (cable or DSL) is available in 1/3 - 1/2 of homes. It certainly seems to be available in most metro areas (though of course with DSL it is still a little spotty even in areas where generally available, since you have to be within, what is it, 3.5 miles? of the telco central office).<p>

However, adoption has been a little slower than I would have thought. In my affluent suburban neighborhood of 50 houses, it has been available for 1 year, and I only know of 2 of us who have cable.
