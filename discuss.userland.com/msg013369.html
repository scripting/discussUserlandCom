Other than <b>Edit this Page</b>, the next feature I thought of (before going to look at the survey) were the discussion groups, which weren't even listed on the survey. It may be that people are already taking them for granted, but the discussion groups (which rely on Edit this Page) underlie so many of the useful things in Manila, that I was surprised to see that feature listed.<p>
