The latest version of Gnutella, 0.56, can be downloaded from <a href="http://gnutella.wego.com/go/wego.group.group?groupId=116705">here</a>. It fixes some of the problems Chuck Sutton <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16102">noted</a>.<p>

The lawyers are coming! That's the trend, as <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,14119,00.html">Metallica</a> sues Napster, and Dr. Dre, a rapper, makes threatening noises in Napster's direction. ZDnet carries <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2543398,00.html">this</a> slightly different perspective.
Apparently all this was too much for <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,14369,00.html">Indiana University</a>, causing them to ban Napster, which got them off the hook in Metallica's suit. Previously, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1719530.html?tag=st.ne.1002.thed.1005-200-1719530">Yale Univeristy</a> had already banned Napster, earning them a suit dismissal also.<p>

Meanwhile, Napster <a href="http://www.napster.com/groundzero/">retorts</a> that it will block access to Napster's services to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1722884.html?dtn.head">"identified violators"</a>. 
I wonder what that means and if it'll expose them to lawsuits from legitimate users. As far as I can see, there is no illegality involved if both parties own the music being exchanged, so how can anyone "identify violators"?<p>

This week was not the best for Napster, prompting <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,14346,00.html">The Standard</a> to ask if it can get any worse. To top it all off, the legal problems have made <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1724481.html?dtn.head">VCs</a> extremely cautious about funding Napster.
However, VCs should take notice of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2531389,00.html">this</a> excellent piece by Charles Cooper that explains why Napster (or something like it) will prevail.
And, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/atcsmonitor/cybercoverage/norton/p-041000pilgrimnapster.html">this</a> CS Monitor piece identifies Napster as the music distribution format of the future.<p>

After Napster comes... <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,13672,00.html">Scour.net</a>'s new "Son Of Napster". You can <a href="http://www.scour.com/Software/Scour_Exchange/">download</a> your own copy if you'd like to try it. Scour.net does not limit itself to MP3 files, like <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1581232.html?tag=st.ne.1005-203-1724481..1005-200-1581232">Wrapster</a> and <a href="http://cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/03/29/gnutella.folo/index.html">Gnutella</a> it can exchange <i>any</i> file type.
IMHO this is the future of file exchange. FTP is dead.
