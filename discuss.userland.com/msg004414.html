MacOS X will also be based on the same (or similar and
also open) technology. Mach will change to 3.0, and
DriverKit will be replaced by IOKit. Both should
be released under Darwin, since Apple is talking
about them on the Darwin page, warning developers
to expect changes.<p>

OS X is going to be much more generally useful to
Mac users, and is eventually going to be the center
of Apple's operating system development going forward.<p>

Considering this, it makes much more sense to release
the OS X code than to release MacOS code, which Apple
won't be using much longer, and which has significant
limitations.<p>

Seems to me it's better to be gradually leaving behind
a closed system and moving towards an *open* system, than
moving towards a *closed* system, whild leaving behind an
open system.
