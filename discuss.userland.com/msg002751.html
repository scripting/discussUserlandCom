<i>let me know how it prints</i><p>

It's not clear what your goals in printing are - can you specify them?<p>

is it more than - it all prints out, and you get all the text and pictures?<p>

I printed the first 10 pages - the last page for me was in  the "variables" section  - I got to the "Avoid changing Types" box.<p>

The "Always declare local Variables" box was split across two pages (though I wonder if you have any control over that anyway).<p>

Everything else seemed to come out fine.<p>

Cheers,
Christopher
