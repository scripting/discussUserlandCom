The constitution is very clear on the conditions for impeachment. The infamous "high crimes and misdemeanors." At this point there is no evidence whatsoever that Clinton committed any offense that falls into that category.<p>

Sexual harassment is not a high crime. It is a serious crime, but it doesn't have anything to do with national security or the sovereignty of the United States. The writers of the constitution were careful to make sure the president couldn't be removed from office for ordinary criminal charges, possibly brought forth by a politically motivated prosecutor (ring any bells?).<p>

Impeachment or no, nothing is preventing the criminal justice system to bring charges against Clinton once he is out of office. Voting "No" to impeachment does not mean that Clinton is in the clear. Impeachment should not be used as a method to express moral outrage. It is the first step in removing a democratically elected president from office. By all accounts, the American people do still want him in office. Which shouldn't protect Clinton if he actually committed high crimes, but again, there is no evidence that suggests that.<p>

The one good thing that has resulted from this whole affair is the careful reexamination of the role of the president - a much needed refresher course in civics for a country that slept through the last presidential election.<p>

Every vote for impeachment is a vote against the constitution. Not that that ever bothered some of our legislators.<p>
