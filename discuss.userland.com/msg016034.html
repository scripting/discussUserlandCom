Here's a question which I keep meaning to ask...<p>

When ETP/Weblogs.Com or any Manila site has a Pike button and I click on it, is there anything 'special' that Manila sends to Pike or is it all just xml-rpc communication?<p>

Here's the scenario..  I'm at home, running Linux and for whatever reason I don't feel like editing in the browser.  I have a Pike-compatible Java editor which accepts xml-rpc calls and handles them correctly.  When I click on the Pike button, would it come up in my app?<p>

Does this make sense?<p>
