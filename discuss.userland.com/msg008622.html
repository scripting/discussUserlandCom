I've been looking into buying such products for quite some time but the high prices have backed me off. The funny thing is that the only company I was considering was Lucent because they were the only ones to have Mac drivers ! I imagine existing 802.11 Lucent cards work just fine with Apple's AirPort... so for Windows it should be easy. For Linux I don't have a clue if the drivers exists. 802.11 is suppose to work across different vendors so other cards might work... the brave will try out !<p>

Apple went with the standard AND broke the price barrier... nice move !
