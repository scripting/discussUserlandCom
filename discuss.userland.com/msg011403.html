<ol>
<li>If this is interactive channel, also replace 'action' with our proxy script and put original 'action' in a hidden field (as James proposed).</li>
<li>User submits search, calling our proxy script which simply displays results on separate page - this would simplify the design and allow greater performance.

MyWebNews.com has a lot of caching.. E.g. all you see on MWN home page is generated from cache : module data (title,link,description,ratings etc.) is stored in DB but it's cached in ASP's Application object, headlines are also cached, results of more complex modules ( not RSS ) are also cached, HTTP retrievals are also cached etc.
