As has already been said, major OSes already include system-level anti-aliasing:<p>

<UL><p>

<LI>
Windows 95, via the Plus! Pack (which also included things like the Internet Setup Wizard)<p>

<LI>
Mac OS 8.5 and later<p>

<LI>
Windows 98 (and NT 4?)<p>

</UL><p>

For specific instructions on a Mac:<p>

<OL><p>

<LI>
Open the Appearance control panel.<p>

<LI>
Go to the "Fonts" tab in the control panel.<p>

<LI>
Turn on "Smooth all fonts on screen."<p>

<LI>
Set a minimum size for font smoothing (anti-aliasing); it must be 12 points or greater. Be aware that the normal system font sizes (for menus and other interface elements, but not window contents) are 12 point.<p>

</OL><p>

The anti-aliasing feature, as far as I can tell, is turned on by default on all new Macs (and has been, since Mac OS 8.5 came out more than a year ago) and by system upgrades from older versions to Mac OS 8.5+. Turning it off, or setting the minimum to a slightly larger size, can still improve screen redraw performance noticeably, particularly on slower Macs.<p>

<B>Note:</B> Because Macs assume a screen resolution of 72 dpi (vs. 96 dpi for Windows), Macs will use fewer pixels to render a 12 point font than a Windows computer will. That generally means that anti-aliasing is a little less effective, to my eye, on small fonts on a Mac screen. (It also means that Macs can display "more" at 1024x768 and other screen sizes than Windows computers can. Compare a Word document at the same zoom setting on a Mac vs. a Windows PC, for example.) But then again, I use Windows hardly ever.<p>

There are also alternative system-level anti-aliasing schemes for the Mac, too.<p>

One is Adobe Type Manager -- the ubiquitous ATM. ATM 4 (I think that's where they started it) and later can anti-alias type, but only do so with PostScript Type 1 fonts (not TrueType).<p>

Greg Landwebber's shareware SmoothType extension also does system-level anti-aliasing; it works on both PostScript and TrueType fonts. It has been out for many years and should easily be found via Versiontracker.com. I tend to find that its anti-aliasing is a little too blurry for my degenerating eyes. :)
