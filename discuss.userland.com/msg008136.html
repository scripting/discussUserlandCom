I  wanted to tell you about a few typos I noticed.  <p>

In the "Avoid changing types" box under the "Assigning Values to Variables" section you forgot the "to"<p>

<blockquote><i>"This is not a hard-and-fast rule, but it is something [to] remember.</blockquote></i><p>

also, in the third sentence of  "Your Fourth Macro" section, you're missing an "a"<p>

<blockquote><i>Imagine you have [a] macro that wants to know .....</blockquote></i><p>

These are very minor suggestions.  There are however, <b>two typos in the sample code on this same page that can cause problems.
</B><p>
In the 3rd to last line of the "insertByDirective" code you mistakenly refer to flProcesssMacros (one too many s's).<p>

Also, in the next paragraph in the code for the html new page, you refer to the directive #processMacrosInInsertFiles instead of #processMacrosInInsertedFiles  (notice the ed).<p>

Hope you find this suggestions helpful.  Thanks for the good docs.<p>

Micah
