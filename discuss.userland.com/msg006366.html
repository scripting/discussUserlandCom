For example say in prefs I wanted to have each website with description as a table entry and people to be able to add as many sites as they wanted.  Does the structure allow for people to add a new entry, with out having to define an <item> entry for all the possible entries that they might have. So that if Bill has two sites there are 3 text boxes (with one to add a new entry) and Ann has 10 sites there are 11 text boxes.
