Generally, they want to be able to make text changes to currently existing pages.  Sometimes they want to add new pages, but that's more rare.  Anyway, I need a solution that doesn't require the client to have frontier, or to know anything about it.  <p>

I guess Content Server is the closest i can come, but I really want a browser based solution.  I would love to give them the url to a "control panel" where they can see the current page and then edit the text below it.  But, as I understand it, that requires the user to use Frontier.<p>

I did a search for "console" and "control panel", but I'm still confused as to if this is functionality that already, or will exist within Frontier.<p>

I'd appreciate any ideas or pointers.  Has anyone else had such requests?<p>

Well, it looks like this is actually implemented to some extent in the discussion group.  This is the first time I've posted a message, so I hadn't run across it, but i'm editing this post as I type.  I'll just have to adapt it to static pages in a site, i guess.<p>
