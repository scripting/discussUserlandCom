I think Jeff Veen's <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7353">message</a> of a few days ago speaks of why an aggregation of headlines shouldn't matter in the long run.<p>

It seems that both formats have strengths and both have a place.  Personally, when I come to Scripting News, I come for more than just the links.  I look for the context that Dave puts his links into.  With the Scripting News format I can have the headlines aggregated and still have Dave's commentary.<p>

On the other hand, if I had a desktop app looking for headlines, I would only want the headlines so RSS would be perfect.<p>
