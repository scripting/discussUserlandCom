Still, they make enough to make it worth continuing. I find it hard to believe that the gov't *really* wants to stop people smoking. It's been a *very* good revenue source for them. On top of that, they're suing big tobacco for billions, and spending it on non-smoking-related items. (Sorry I don't have sources for that information, but I believe it to be correct.)<p>


I imagine that there are those who see taxing guns as a fairly lucrative business. I don't see it as doing anything to stop those who want the guns, though.<p>
