these are the words, thoughts, beliefs, etc. of my Polish, Communist Buddy, Marek J.  Being the Polak that he is, my name is on this.  Do I think it's cool?  YES! Check out this other thing he had to say at his own <a href="http://soapbox.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$4">weblog </a><p>

But guess what??  I found the error and didn't do anything about it for long enough to be initially seen as "the author" . . . about an hour . . . and there were enough hits that I am now coming clean - communicate with him @<a href="http://soapbox.weblogs.com">soapbox.weblogs.com</a>
