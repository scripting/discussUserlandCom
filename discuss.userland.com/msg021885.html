It now has support for wizzy styles, <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> and <u>underline</u>, and links. No more text-cluttering HTML codes for common formats and links. <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/wizzyRadioScreen.gif">Screen shot</a>. <br><br>No nice way to say this. The Mets lost game four, we're down 3-1 in the series. These are times when it helps to have a strong philosophy.<br><br>Tonight's Scripting News dinner was at <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/E/V/NYCNY/0000/89/39/">Katz's Deli</a>, 205 East Houston Street at Ludlow. 212-254-2246. 8PM. It was great, as usual. I'll write more about it tomorrow for sure.<br><br>Hey the cool thing about being in NY is that you don't have to act like you're not from NY. ";->"<br><br>Dan Gillmor's Groove <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg102400.htm">article</a>. Now, remembering that I like Groove, there are other points to consider. It's clearly not about the Web. The first feature requests, imho, will be about bringing it closer to the Web. We want to help with that, with connections to Manila. Also the demo apps are reminiscent of the early demo apps for Hypercard and Marimba's Castanet. Another platform where the apps are up to the users. Of course Frontier was there too at one time, and so was Notes (I hear). In the end it's not up to the users, it's up to the platform vendor to decide what it's used for, and then promote that as opposed to promoting the platform. There's a lot of thoughtful work in Groove, but there's still a lot of thoughtful work that remains. That's why being in it for the long haul is so important.<br><br>Hey I just got invited to join a Groove workspace. Yes, the <a href="http://static.userland.com/gems/scriptingNews/grooveInvite.xml">invitation</a> is in XML. Here's a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/grooveInviteXmlScreen.gif">screen shot</a> of the XML file in case your browser doesn't like XML. Lots of binary stuff.<br><br><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_44/b3705001.htm">The cover story</a> of the latest Business Week is about Microsoft Dot-Net. After reading the article I had a strong belief that Microsoft has absolutely no idea what they're doing. The reporter worked on the story for several months. I talked with him three times. He had access to everyone at Microsoft. In the end, there's still no clear two-sentence explanation of what the hell it is. How can a company as large as Microsoft pursue something so vague?<br><br>Here's my two-sentence description of Dot-Net, which also happens to be the value in P2P. The Web is great because it brought easy-to-use networking to desktop computer users, but desktop computers are capable of much more than browsing the Web, as are desktop computer users. The next step in the evolution of software is to re-integrate the capabilities of desktop computers with the ease-of-use of Web-based networking. That Microsoft plays an important role in this is obvious. (OK, it's three sentences.)<br><br>I had breakfast this morning with Clay Shirky. Smart guy.<br><br>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/25/sports/25VECS.html">Mets 4, Yankees 2</a>. "The Mets may have been helped by the return to their ballpark, but also to real baseball, rather than the bogus brand played in the American League. Like a rogue elephant, the designated hitter rule squats in the center of the World Series, leaving its odoriferous presence."<br><br>Basically if there were no designated hitter rule, guys like Roger Clemens would have to be more careful about where they throw the ball (and bats now too). If he had to step up to the plate, you can be sure his body would eventually (immediately) make contact with a 90+ mph fastball.<br><br>
