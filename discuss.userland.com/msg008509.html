And if they are not?  They get a file downloaded someplace that may or may not be auto-decompressed that they can then open by hand?  No thanks.  If you want people to read your stuff you need to make it accessible to them as long as they are using a reasonable(*) viewer.<p>

(*) We can't debate all day long what a reasonable viewer is.  I don't wish to.  But requring the most recent version of something that may not run on older, servicable hardware, is not reasonable IMO.
