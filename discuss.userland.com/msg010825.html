Why not have an 'exclude all' option, so that if there are three or four channels a user wants to view, they don't have to go through a long process of removal.<p>

Also, instead of listing stories by hour, it might be more flexible on the user end to have an option to list the last [X number of] stories. At least, this would make sense to those who do not subscribe to the majority of channels.<p>

How about a top 50 for channels?<p>

Is this the right way to suggest features? Also, are you accepting suggestions for features on m.u.c?<p>

cheers!
