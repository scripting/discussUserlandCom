Sure, it'd be nice (maybe) if they shipped with a Nameserver and maybe a few of the other standard services (Trader and Notifications, not to mention OTS), but for the level of app that things like XML-RPC and SOAP target, all you need is an IDL compiler and the appropriate libraries to link with.  Sun's JVM ships with these by default.  In fact, they should be in every copy of Netscape (look at the URL about: for the Visigenic logo).
