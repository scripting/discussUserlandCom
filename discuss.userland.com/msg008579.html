I assume you are or will be flooded with email
concerning Chris Nolan's situation. I'll be very direct.... only reason my
eyeballs ever see ads on your site is reading those columns. Do you really
want to loose my two very attentive eyeballs?<p>

Hopefully you will realize how easily something can slip by someone like me
on the web.  But the opportunity to email about this<p>

made me grab my keyboard and type.  I'm someone who is always too busy to
take time to email someone like you.  THINK about<p>

the dominant underground who avoids getting involved and gets it on with
their own world.  Please; I hate to loose things I like.  It<p>

hurts to see something screwed with that I didn't even once express my
appreciation for; but friend that time has come, you may<p>

see this email and many others just like it for that matter and feel "this
is a very ugly time for me" (I'm obviously guessing your<p>

feelings; I hope I'm wrong); of course I don't want this email to relay that
type of message.  Please for people like me... give it some<p>

thought.  You made me think today.  Think about me as a person... a person
who primarily would have never let you no I even<p>

existed.  I'm reaching; it's rare, but sometimes (you sense that maybe I
should help; maybe I should give away some of my<p>

feelings) I know it was worth doing.<p>


Peace to you and your loved ones....
