So donate some money to the
             foundation (big tax writeoff) and use it to train people in CS and particularly the ArsDigita
             Community System, and then hire those people.<p>

Oh, you're probably right, but they're up front about it.  There's a place on the web site that says that they need quality programmers and that's why they teach and offer their course materials for free.  If you can make it through and do the exercises they'll consider hiring you.<p>

The salaries make me sigh...maybe I should do an undergraduate degree in computer science, instead of a PhD in educational technology?<p>
