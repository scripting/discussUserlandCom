What they are calling the SOLID "Embedded Engine" is actually a very robust RDBMS, with support for pretty much everything you'd expect (SMP support, full transaction support, etc).<p>

The pricing (at least when I was researching this stuff a while back) is much more reasonable the MS or Oracle.<p>

BTW, this things is very-multiplatform (NT, Solaris, Linux, other Unices).<p>

Pretty nice package overall, and no I don't work for them or get any money from endorsing it.  I just went through a lot of trouble researching cheap database engines, and this was the best one we could find.<p>
