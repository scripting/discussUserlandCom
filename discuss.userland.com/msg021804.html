Speaking for myself, I read Scripting News almost everyday, & enjoy it alot. I like your writing. I don't always agree with it, but I like reading it because it hasn't been sanitized by a PR department. It's rough, raw, straight from the hip. It doesn't sound like it's been written by a committee of politicians.<p>

The web community will lose alot if you drop it.<p>

Here is what I would do in your situation, if that is any help. I would simply announce that I was no longer going to monitor or participate in the Discussion area. I would write the Daily News, & peek now & then in the Discussion area to see if something I said was grossly misunderstood. If I felt that there was a problem, I would address it in the News, not as a reply.<p>

I don't think there is any need to defend your positions in the Discussion area. If you get sucked into it, it can easily become a 24/7 job. I think your POV is well represented in your writings, & you could just leave the Discussion area for others to get their 2 cents in.<p>

Hope this helps!
