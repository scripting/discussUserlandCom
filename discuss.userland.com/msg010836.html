I started following this thread today when I discovered Jon's headline titling method for his articles.  My thought is that some sort of catagorization scheme would be great, but what about catagories + "content classifications"???<p>

His headlines start out with "Talk | ..." or "Review | ...".  I don't know if there is anything like this now, but I personally would love to see all articles carry a tag that told me what kind of an article it is.  If I was looking for a "Review |" of a PalmPilot, I could narrow down to those articles and block "News | PalmPilot" articles or even, like the poster channel that's on my.userland.com all the time, "VendorListings | PalmPilot".  Could make a lot of vertical portal's jobs easier.<p>

Just throwing it out there since we are getting started.  Any thoughts?<p>

Now I swear there was something I was looking for when I stopped here, what was it???  Man, I always get caught up in this site.
