Also there's tighter editorial control and better focus here, as Dave has pointed out on several occasions, so the general quality of postings tends to be higher. </i><p>

There may be tighter focus, but what I'm looking for are the 5's of the slashdot world. The posts that clearly answer a particular question that I'm having, especially when the documentation revealed by my search question doesn't have the answers.<p>

For example,  <p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$8553">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$8553</a><p>

Was the exact answer that I was looking for. I'd like to call that out as a useful article.<p>

<i>A logical question, then, is how to do this? Let anyone vote? Should these tags only be visible to the poster, or to others?</i><p>

Ideally, these tags would be reflected in the relevance in the search engine. If they're only visible to the poster, it's an ego stroking thing. If I'm looking for documentation, I don't typically need to search for the same thing more than once, since once I find the answer, I have sample code to work from for the next time. <p>

As for who votes?  Members. Maybe some reputation thing modifies the power of the vote. Maybe not. <p>

And I also think that having a clueserver.userland.com would be a cool and useful thing.<p>
