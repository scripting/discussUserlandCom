I get quite enough hate mail in my inbox these days for having built the site - I'm perfectly happy to not see it here.<p>

Besides, the issue I was bringing up has NOTHING to do with a discussion of the pros and cons of gun control. Rather, I'm trying to bring up the fact that the Internet was used as such a powerful tool to put this all together. The world is a changing...<p>

I also find it interesting that the media has all but ignored this part of the story - the mobilization of a massive grass roots political movement almost completely done through the Internet.<p>
