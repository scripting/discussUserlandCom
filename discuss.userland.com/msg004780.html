As the grass pops through the dirt, we see new types of tools changing the landscape of 'end-user' programming.  The trick is to get as much power into the hands of end-users as possible - and empower them with 'real' programmer type malleability, customization and object oriented adaptability.<p>

Chats, Discussion Groups and WebLogs will automatically be indexed into ODB's and accessed through Table of Contents, visual 'maps' or timelines.  On-line writing will merge with hypermedia authoring and find themselves in thevalley of the Portals.  Shared databases of 'knowledge' will be dynamically maintained - within certain, niche 'communities' or across a broad spectrum of users.<p>

A New Paradigm of Tools will provide incredible power and flexibility for free and change the landscape of creativity.<p>

As one of the fathers of multimedia, and of multimedia authoring specifically - let me tell you that Frontier is REALLY what Scalable Content is all about.<p>

I tell this story everyday. "Want to amortize your investment in Content, want to enable new types of adaptable interfaces - want to implement Tools to lower your production costs?"<p>

"Well then use FRONTIER!"<p>
