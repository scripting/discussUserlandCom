A press release from ARIBA on Feb 8th <a href="http://www.ariba.com/News/AribaArchive/cxml.htm">here</a>.<p>

It states "(cXML was) Developed in concert with more than 40 leading companies, cXML is a set of lightweight XML DTDs"<p>

Anyone have any info?  There are no links to additional info in release and my search through the Internet (Web, Usenet, etc) revealed a total sum of (0) documents with the word "cXML" in them.  _Shocking_ given the support and number of participants.<p>

Background:
You would think, with as much talk that's going on with words like "e-commerce", "xml", "application servers" that this stuff would be beyond the FUD stage.  As far as XML and e-commerce are concerned, it appears everyone has been rolling their own.<p>

I did find some info on XML-EDI.  I'm not in love there.<p>

We're using XML-RPC.  It's very easy, does the job.  However I want to tweak the XML a bit and can then could no longer state we're using a standard.  That seems counter productive.<p>

I don't feel like creating yet another standard so.. I'd love to look into cXML.  Any info would be much appreciated.  (Or other links to XML/RPC e-commerce type articles/info)<p>
