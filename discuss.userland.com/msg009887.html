When installing my cable-modem I had a similar thought!... My local cable company had warned me of their lack of support for the Mac and that something was wrong with OpenTransport (and yadda-da etc...)...<p>

So I brought along a NT laptop from work to test things out. It turns out that once the cable-modem was installed, all I had to do was to select an item (DHCP) in the Mac's TCP/IP Control Panel and <i>boom!</i>... on the net <b>without</b> rebooting!!!<p>

Whereas the NT box!... ha!... It took me a fair share of reboots before I remembered that we use a WinSock Proxy Client at work.... and there is no way I can toggle the think on and off without rebooting at least once!...
