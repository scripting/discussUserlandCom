I went to Fry's yesterday to get a wireless LAN, and came back with a 250-foot 10-base-T extension cord instead. So I'm writing this outside, where it's not 100 degrees as it is in my office. I wonder if I'll get used to working out here? We'll see. </i><p>

mmm... thats sounds great, Then again I'm writing this outside on a beautiful night... (well, on my fire escape that hangs over the din of the Brooklyn-Queen Expressway :-(,  at least I can also see the Bridge, and Battery Park, and smell the salt water :-)<p>

And if I've learned anything about long 10-Base-T cords is they don't like kinks, and LCD monitors don't like direct sunlight.<p>

Enjoy Dave, enjoy.
