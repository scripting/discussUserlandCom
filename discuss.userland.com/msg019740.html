Eric, ever since I was a child, I wanted to be a commercial artist. To me, the way I define success is creating something that a lot of people love and pay for. It's weird because I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about money, except around payroll time, or the end of months and then I try to keep the time to a minimum, so it isn't the money that's driving me, but I love the idea of being commercial and making products.<p>

I wish we could do without all the stupid trends. Certainly source code is a good thing. Being generous with source code is a good thing. But ultimately it has very little to do with the art of software. <p>
