I was having horrible problems logging into SF with IE5...finally found a bug report at SF regarding this. Apparently, SF's 128-bit certificate is making non-128-bit IE make SF barf...or something like that...(here's the link):<p>

Anyway, I upgraded my IE from 40-bit to 128-bit encryption, per the bug report suggestion, and things started working better. Don't know what you're using, but if you can perform the equivalent task, it might help...
