I've seen Cam's excellent <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11617"> report</a> on content management systems and was wondering if any other Scripting News readers had any recent experience, praise, or flames they'd like to share.  I know CNN is using their products and that it's written in Perl.  Thanks for the info.  I'll write up what I learn after talking to them.<p>
