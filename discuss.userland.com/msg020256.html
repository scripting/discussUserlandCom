Well, I feel you tried to change the topic by bringing up the enforcability of the GPL rather than the ethics of the DWPL, but it's clear you think that Dave's Wacky Public License is unethical as well.  That's fine.  I don't agree with you, but you've made your position clear.<p>

My next question is this: if you think the GPL is unenforceable, then why don't you go ahead and use whatever GPLed code you want!  Certainly you could make a killing by taking a mature product that isn't being developed much anymore and adding some amazing new features to it.  Just release the binary, wait for the FSF to sue you, and you'll be able to invalidate the GPL in court.  Then we won't have to argue anymore!<p>
