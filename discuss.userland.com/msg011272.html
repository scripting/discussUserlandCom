Yes, hps is hits per second, hpd is hits per day.<p>

Zope behind Apache is 10-15 hits per second, Zope alone is 40-50 hits per second.<p>

AOLServer stats were 5 million hits per day on a low-end box, and 500,000 a day on a mid-range box but using only 1-3 percent of the CPU.<p>

I think I suggested 10-15 thousand hits per second etc etc which is obviously too high.
