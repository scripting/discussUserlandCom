It took a long time to arrive at that. I debated whether or not I wanted to give that much power to a guest db, and now I think this approach has the safety I wanted. You have to specifically put a boolean in the user.databases table for the database to have the #startup script run. <p>

Basically, guest databases changed everything, for the better, by a lot. Now I think it's clear how to deploy this stuff. Very exciting!<p>
