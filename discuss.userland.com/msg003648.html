I already use NT, MacOS, BeOS, Linux, and Solaris. What (specifically) can Amiga offer me that they can't? Besides the fact that it runs on the Magical Mystery Chip (MicroUnity?), I don't see any real advantages to Amiga OS.<p>

(In case y'all aren't familiar with the rumors, the Magical Mystery Chip is cheap enough to power $500 computers, has more power than a Pentium III, and improves your sex life. We don't know who actually makes this MMC, and I'm not even sure Amiga has decided yet. But Amiga OS 5.0 will only run on it...)
