The pages only function properly when served dynamically to your web browser via mainResponder.<p>

This also means that the entries in the #urls table need to be http urls (not file urls). Assuming your GDB is named testpublish.root and located in the www sub-folder of your Guest Databases folder, the entries should look as follows:<p>

memberCheckMail <a href="http://localhost/testpublish/logon/checkYourMail">http://localhost/testpublish/logon/checkYourMail</a><p>

<i>#members = employees, which exists in my members.root table.</i><p>

What is the value of config.mainResponder.globals.defaultMembershipGroup? I take it to be "default"? That would not be a problem - but to prevent you from running into further problems, you should either rename the "logon" site to "public" or create a new top-level table named "public" in your GDB's top-level window and move the "logon" site into it. Either way remember to adapt the entries in the #urls table.<p>

Accessing any object contained in a table named "public" doesn't require membership - even if there is a #members directive. Obviously you can't require membership for the logon pages - because the client is not a member yet.<p>

<i>I see that responder.members.signupForm has the following line active: local (formaction = pta^.path) while responder.members.logonForm has that line commented out. Funny.</i><p>

Don't worry about this now. In responder.members.logonForm, the formaction url is generated by looking at pta^.responderattributes.urls^.memberHome.<p>

<i>I'm starting to get frustrated with how difficult it seems to be to add membership capability.</i><p>

Most of your problems are probably due to the misunderstanding that you would be able to publish dynymic pages to your local drive and they would function properly.
