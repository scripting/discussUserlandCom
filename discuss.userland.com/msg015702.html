Great time see you on the web tomorrow.<br><br>Here's the ManilaPalooza <a href="http://www.gilbert.org/.biapchat">chatroom</a>!<br><br>And the <a href="http://64.14.1.90/webcast2">webcast</a>.<br><br><a href="http://pikebeta.userland.com/whatIsThis">What is Pike?</a> "Pike is an outliner that's been custom-fitted to plug into Manila sites. You can create and edit stories with Pike. You can use it to edit your home page. And you can also use it to edit the myriad of templates that define how a Manila site is rendered. It's both a writing and design tool."<br><br>Of course there's a Pike-Beta <a href="http://pikebeta.userland.com/mail">mail list</a>. <br><br>Basic things about Pike. <b>1.</b>You must have a Manila site you can write for. Without a site, Pike is useless. It *only* works over the net. <b>2. </b>Pike is a free public beta. No need to grovel. Everyone gets one. (This list will be added to.)<br><br>Screen shots of Pike being used to edit a <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/pikeEditingScriptingNews.gif">weblog</a>, <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/pikeEditingATemplate.gif">template</a>, <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/pikeEditingAStory.gif">story</a>, <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/pikeEditingXml.gif">XML</a> and the <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/pikeHomePageEditing.gif">home page</a> of the Pike-beta site.<br><br>This <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/pikeEditingAStory.gif">screen shot</a> would probably mean the most to MORE and ThinkTank users.<br><br>Yes yes yes we're going to <a href="http://march25.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$290">webcast</a> ManilaPalooza.<br><br><a href="http://march25.editthispage.com/">ManilaPalooza</a> began for me last night. While Brent and Andre fixed bugs, did a security checkout and got the downloads and license agreement ready, Sheila and I went for a walk, and then did a little web work, and then drove to Palo Alto to get Spicy Noodles takeout (a first!) we talked about weblogs, community, outages. <br><br>I had some comments here about design vs cheese, but based on email I think I'll wait till next week to explore this stuff. <br><br>IP Law: <a href="http://www.lawnewsnetwork.com/practice/iplaw/news/A19011-2000Mar17.html">Bar Reacts To Bezos Patent Reform Plan</a>.<br><br>New channel: <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1802">Exploring XML</a> from Webreference.Com.<br><br>The NY Times <a href="http://search.nytimes.com/books/00/03/26/reviews/000326.26walkert.html">reviews</a> Cluetrain.

Whether the demo goes well or not, today is a day when writing for the web becomes easier than it's ever been. There will be many more of these days. <br><br>I want to change the tagline for Pike from <i>The first Web outliner</i> to <i>The Web's first outliner.</i> Subtle but important difference. We are part of the web, our success is the web's success. When we win the web wins. That's part of the Ask Not philosophy.<br><br>
