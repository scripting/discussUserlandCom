To the VARs: I'm not going to _never_ purchase 3rd party add-ons... but what I would buy would be peripheral to the core stuff I look to UserLand for.<p>

The "VA" in VAR is the important thing -- I would probably consider buying things like FTP servers or mail/list servers or DLLs that connected to wild and funky things that for one reason or another we could use -- because I don't look to UserLand to deliver those kinds of features.<p>

But like I said, when it has to do with core CMS on Frontier, I look to UserLand.<p>

Thanks for listening.... really, thanks!<p>

Jim
