If we can't make the refresh reliably fast (perhaps with the "two frames" technology described earlier by Stefan Kutzman <<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$4727">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$4727</a>>) a technographer-controlled push would be preferable to "automatic" because it would be easier for the technographer to direct the participants' attention to the update. The update, though, would still have to be within that 4-6 seconds window, I believe.
