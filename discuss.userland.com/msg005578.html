It's a very lightweight thing. Think of PHP3 as an "inline CGI" language. It's not quite like Frontier or Zope--it doesn't have a database or a huge procedural library built in.<p>

Imagine server side includes which don't suck, and you'll get the general idea. ;-)<p>

<I>how is the performance/stability/security aspects?</I><p>

Good enough. It's a mature GNU program, so it's generally quite stable and reliable. By itself, PHP3 is reasonably fast. But there's a replacement engine which makes it scream. I don't remember all the details.<p>

Cheers, Eric
