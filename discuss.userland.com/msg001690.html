You say "not so good."<p>

You then site your original expectations for the DG.  I am not arguing 
with your original premise.  There is nothing wrong with those.  However, you should consider this metafor.<p>

When my daughter was born 17 years ago, I expected a whole lot.  I wanted things for her that I did not have growing up.  I gave her a lot of experiences.  Took her places and told her things.<p>

Up to about age 15 she did me proud. She was meeting all of my original expectations.  Everyone gave me comments that made Dad's head swell and they were all feel goods.<p>

At home was another story.<p>

Then she decided to go her own way.  She was going to do what she wanted, when she wanted.<p>

The next year and a half were "HELLO"!<p>

I was embarrassed, I was upset!  She was not meeting my expectations.<p>

Then the lite came on, and my attitude changed.  <p>

I am once again proud of my daughter and what she is doing.  While she is not doing it the way I would, she is doing something.  Her head is going in a direction I like.  She is just driving a car I wouldn't be caught dead in.  (Of course I'm 48 and drive a Volvo, and she is 17 and drives a Cavalier)<p>

Just because the DG doesn't meet your original expectations, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.  As you know, I just found out about the DG and how to use it last Sunday.  Have you given it enough time to take hold?  Have you clearly communicated your expectations?  If you are getting posts that are rude and offensive,  where are the guidelines that tell us what is appropriate?<p>

This is the the ONLY website, including my own, that I have logged onto daily since I found it. <p>

I don't know where you (the creator) want it to head.  I'm not sure where I want it to head.  I thought, since I heard about it on the Frontier Users List that it was a scripting resource.  After reading a few posts, I find that there is more here than that.  I wondered if these types of posts were going to stay up.  <p>

Enough from me.<p>

Let's hear from some others<p>
