All WAP 1.1 compliant mobile phones also support the WMLscript (JavaScript like scripting language based on EcmaScript) scripting language. WMLscript is used to add intelligence to your WML decks in the same way that you use JavaScript to add local intelligence to HTML pages.<p>

Java is not available in any of the shipping WAP mobile phones. However Motorola have a new mobile phone called the Timeport 1088 that will ship here in the UK in April next year that is Java based and will support both WAP and ''full' HTML. Motorola admit however that the 1088 will not be a mass market product and is aimed more at the corporate market for vertical market applications etc.<p>

Bluetooth will deliver a low power wireless local area network around a device equipped with it. The first shipping product with Bluetooth in it will probably be a wireless handsfree headset (was shown at Comdex) from Ericsson - will be an add-on for existing mobile phones (T28, R320, R380 etc). Eventually you will see a large number of Bluetooth mobile phone 'peripherals' that will lead to products that break the mobile phone up into a number of networked components - that radio component might stay clipped to your belt or in your bag while your Bluetooth handsfree head set allows you to make receive and make calls and a separate credit card sized LCD tablet allows for intreracting with applications etc...all connected back to the the Radio component by Bluetooth.<p>

Yes there are a number of email services available - some use SMS to deliver the first 160 characters of an email to your phone and others are starting to use a combination of SMS alerts ('you have mail') and then use a WAP application to disply the email on the mobile phone. Check out www.mailandnews.com from Infinite technologies using their Intchange mail server with a WAP front end. SMTP mail is not directly supported by any of the current WAP mobile phones.<p>
