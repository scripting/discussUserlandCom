I followed the instructions on the "How to Serve .wsf Pages from IIS" page until step 4. I'm not sure what it means by "install FrontierGetsEverything.dll." How/where do I install the DLL? Does that mean register it? That doesn't seem to work. <p>

I'm also unsure about your step #4. In the ISAPI filter list, all I see is a place for a single name and dll for each filter. I'm not sure how to translate that to  "Setup to ISAPI filter (frontier.dll) with the 'frontierGetsEverything.dll'."<p>

So, I installed an ISAPI filter, called frontier, pointing to frontierGetsEverything.dll. That seems to do something, but now I just get 404s when I try to access the site.<p>

I notice iisFrontier.dll has not been used anywhere. The instructions just told me to copy it to my scripts directory. <p>

Thanks for your help.<p>
