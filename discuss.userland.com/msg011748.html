You can use the flow to implement a search engine, to include stories from sites like Wired, Red Herring, Salon or Motley Fool on your home page, or you could mail links to stories to people who subscribe to your service. There's already a rich flow of stories coming thru this channel."<p>

The next step is to release the Frontier 6 affiliate app. With luck Zope and Perl versions should be available at the same time.<p>

The My.UserLand XML <a href="http://backend.userland.com/stories/storyReader$10">archives</a> are back on-line after the aggregator-affiliate split. <i>Hard work!</i><p>

Last night I read the first couple of chapters in Tim Berners-Lee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062515861/ref%3Ded%5Foe%5Fh/002-5307651-5309448">autobiography</a>. First observation, I wish, when he was looking for a hypertext company to work with in the late 80s, he had talked to me! We missed each other by inches, it seems. Second, before he developed the worldwide web, he worked on RPC over the Internet. Wow. I'd like to meet him someday and show him how our <a href="http://www.outliners.com/">outliners</a> work. His writing makes me want to deeply integrate outlining and the web. I highly recommend this book to anyone who takes the web professionally. It's opening my eyes in a new way.<p>

BTW, TBL is a professor at MIT. <i>Synchronicity!</i><p>
