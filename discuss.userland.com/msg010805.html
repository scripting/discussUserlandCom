Of course you're right - a great example of this is the little piece of code which allows anyone to add the contents of a channel to a static page, that was posted here a few days ago (can't find the URL now).<p>

You said "but who's gonna make that magic bullet, that little bit of code that leads to EASY syndication?  I'd like to think it would be a bit of javascript that could parse XML"<p>

Can you be more specific?  I'd definitely like to explore some more what might constitute a magic bullet, and will put some thought into it today.<p>
