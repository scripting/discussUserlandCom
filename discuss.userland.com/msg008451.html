A thought:<p>

Allow for the copying of preferences from one account to another (with entering the appropriate passwords, etc.)<p>

Then add an AKA preference field to detail any other email addresses you have been known as. <p>

Old messages would remain with the previous email, new messages would be on the new email, but there would be an accessible mapping between the two and a relatively easy way to move preferences between accounts.<p>
