Let's get real. If I give you the source code, no matter what the license agreement says, you can do anything you want with it.<p>

This is the in-your-face reality. No one needed to have open source agreements for web pages. Why bother? I know you can view source. So can I. No secret remains undiscoverable. It's open source. Totally.<p>

I am reminded of a teacher, who starting a class discussion, said "When I ask you a question, you can either choose not to answer, tell the truth, or lie."<p>

I puzzled over that for hours. What kind of class is this where you have permission to lie.<p>

Then I realized what the teacher was saying. It was so true, that it's funny I didn't get it at first.<p>

Just to prove that I have a twinkle in my eye, I'm not going to explain, and leave it as an exercise for the reader.
