You can get it from <p>

<a href="http://www.vkamedia.com/downloads/when.root">http://www.vkamedia.com/downloads/when.root</a><p>

If you're using Windows, type this into the Address on IE (not Netscape). IE will ask you if you want to save it. Save it and then open it up in Frontier.<p>

If your using a Mac, use the same URL above, but then after it completely loads in the browser do a Save as... (choose source from the popup box) and then change the Type to TABL and the Creator to LAND. Open in Frontier.<p>

Bug fix:<p>

The calendar was not showing links to previous months that had events scheduled.<p>

Added feature:<p>

There is now a page called Group View that will let you view the schedule for 1 or more members of your group. If a member has something scheduled for that day at a certain time it will be colored red. You can see at a glance who is free and at what times. This is useful if you need to schedule a meeting with a someone or a group of people and want to see what they have available. Thanks to Robert Cassidy for suggesting this feature.<p>

I'm going to start working on a giving this app its own web page with better docs and some screenshots. In the meantime you can reach me at <a href="mailto:mike@vkamedia.com">mike@vkamedia.com</a> if you have any questions or suggestions.<p>

Thanks and enjoy!
