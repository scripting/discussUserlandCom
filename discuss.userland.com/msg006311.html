For the system administrator, there is some disagreement about what programs go in /bin vs /usr/bin vs /usr/local/bin.  There are two different arrangements of the system startup/runlevel changing code for loading and unloading services (IMHO everyone should use the Sys V method).  Basically, if you've used one then on another one you might find a few files in different places, but it's not so different that you get lost.
