<p>
Raymond explains to businessmen how using open-source products, or using an open-source development model, is in the businessmen's self-interest.  He acknowledges that in some cases, a closed-source license is <i>better</i> for the business than an open-source one.  He even <a href="http://lwn.net/2000/0803/a/big-lies.php3">condemned Napster</a>: "The real point is that by 'sharing' without the artist's consent, <i>you deprive him of the right to control and dispose of his work</i>.  Forget the record companies; for this issue they are just big bloated red herrings, a noxious excuse, a convenient distraction.  The real question is this: are you going to
support the artists, or steal away the few shreds of autonomy they might have left?"
<p>
Based on some of the comments in this forum, I suspect that some commercial developers have been flamed to cinders by open-source zealots, and see open source's growing popularity as a sign that the zealots are winning.  But even though Stallman's <i>license</i> may be more commonly used than it was, say, five years ago, I don't think Stallman's <i>philosophy</i> has made much headway.
