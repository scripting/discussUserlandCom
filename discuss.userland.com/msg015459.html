Of the people who voted on Prop 22, I'm sure that some of their other votes were cast for people or issues that also lost as well as some that won. How can they be called stupid?<p>

Some people have a real problem with accepting the consequences of their actions and like to lash out at others when events are not favorable to their efforts. Calling people stupid for voting one way or another is one such example.<p>

Californian's are a whole lot smarter than some people think. And most of them wouldn't think of someone else as being stupid because of the perceived way they voted. However, as you have read, not everyone has an open mind about how Democracy works.<p>

On the other hand, maybe Sante Fe is the best place to live and be free of any restraints and prejudices. Something tells me that it wouldn't stay that way for long. How would they settle their differences? Certainly not by voting because stupid people might vote! Ah, but how cool it would be before all that. :-)
