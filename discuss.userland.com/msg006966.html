  In scripting news for 2 June 99 you mentioned that you think the browser belongs in the OS.  Good idea.  Then you talked about how one needs built in system level HTML rendering in MacOS too.  Well, it's partially there.<p>

<a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1142/part07.html#helpViewer">http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1142/part07.html#helpViewer</a><p>

The help veiwer in 8.5 is a html renderer, but, <p>

"Apple recognizes many developers are interested in more information, but no further developer-level information is available at this time." <p>

it's not programmer accessable, nor can you replace it one assumes.<p>

In the 8.6 technote at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1163.html">http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1163.html</a><p>

there is mention under Help Viewer 1.2 about a SDK being available.  <p>

Of course, there always was Cyberdog's html renderer, which was replaceable :-(<p>

Since my Apple PPC systems won't run 8.5+ I can't tell you any more about them.<p>

cheers<p>
