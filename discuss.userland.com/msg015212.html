I'm also using <a href="http://TheUltimateCounter.com">http://TheUltimateCounter.com</a> on fieldtest.editthispage.com <p>

I really like it.  Been using their clock for awhile -- just added the counter today.  Lots of pretties.<p>

And it works nice except it seems to also count me.  That's a great feature of thecounter.com   <p>

If you can't tell the counter to exclude yourself, your stats are skewed.  Especially when you're doing heavy development.<p>


===============  hahahaha  I never appreciated being able to edit my own discussion message as much as I do at this moment.  Spelling errors can be quite embarrassing....but I'll leave that to your imagination.
