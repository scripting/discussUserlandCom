<ol>
<li> An rpc interface spec </li>
<li> A mail server (mail exchanger) capable of making an xmlrpc call to store incoming messages</li>
<li> A database implementing the xml-rpc interface </li>
<li> A web/email client/whatever implementing the message reading part of the spec </li>
</ol><p>

This can be collapsed to one program on one machine (frontier comes to mind), or it can be mail exchanger -> Big Honkin Database server -> Database Access Web interface.<p>

For ultra load, mail exchangers running unix+sendmail+procmail/some c implementation of xml-rpc as a local mailer would be my choice. Mail exchangers are common on larger sites (e.g. 50+k thousand edu accounts)<p>

Your database is whatever you want. Oracle/DB2/Sybase all seem to scale.<p>

Your web front end is once again whatever will scale and you can deal with as an envrionment.<p>

But it all comes down to the well defined xml-rpc interface spec. I'd bet that you could get a working version of this using frontier + mailserver running <i>very</i> quickly after getting an interface spec nailed down. <p>
