I think I might have figured it out.  The designers of Hotmail thought that since they were using frames nobody would ever figure out that HoTMaiL is distributed among several servers.  That is, "www.hotmail.com" <I>should</I> have remained in the browser's location field.  And the decay at the company that Dave mentioned lies at least partially between the designers and programmers.<p>

Could it be that simple?  As strange as it might seem, I think it's a possibility.
