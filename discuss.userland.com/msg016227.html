<p>Please include the "other" category as in the other survey with this invitation so that we can capture new categories for the future.</p>
<p>I believe that the designer category you have is aimed at artistic presentation design and not "geek" engineering design.</p>
<p>There are humans interested in information that are consumers of public information without being suits, geeks, or artists, I suggest the category "Reader". There are also some humans that are more interested in writing and publishing their words regardless of the tool used, I suggest the category "Author".</p>
