Perhaps. But here's why character conversion is not the straightforward issue you might think.<p>

A little background: WebEdit works by packing a Frontier object and sending it to the server. The server then unpacks the object in the proper location.<p>

WebEdit does <i>not</i> send plain text. If it did, a client-side callback might be appropriate: you could convert the text before sending it.<p>

The better way to convert text is on the server side, right after unpacking the object. With the new version of WebEdit, you already have a callback that will let you do this.<p>

But note -- there are times when you want to convert text and times when you don't. For instance, if you send a gif stored in the odb via WebEdit, you obviously don't want its data converted at the other end. But what if you're sending a string? It's easy to imagine times when conversion is appropriate, and times when it's not.<p>

The same goes for scripts: I might have a line in a script that reads "if ch < '&Egrave;'" on one platform and "if ch < '&eacute;'" on another -- but I don't want the character conversion, because the meaning is supposed to be "if ch < 233" in both places.<p>

Granted, much of the use of WebEdit is checking in and out wp-texts and outlines -- web page source -- but just because that's what most people do most of the time doesn't make the issue easier.<p>

I'm not ruling out client callbacks, but I'll need to hear more compelling reasons. Character conversion is do-able (in the new version) via server callbacks. And you can write a customized client that talks to a WebEdit server without much difficulty -- the client side of WebEdit is small and straightforward, there's not much code there.
