Does your news site have a #prefs.calendarRootUrl entry? If so, what is its value?<p>

If it doesn't exist, try creating it and setting its value to <a href="http://www.myserver.edu/news/nahenahe/">http://www.myserver.edu/news/nahenahe/</a> (or whatever your real server name might be)<p>

Does this help?
