I recently got hooked up with <a href="http://www.wabasoft.com/">Waba</a>. This is a very good Java virtual machine for PalmOS and WinCE devices. It runs actual Java bytecodes, compiled by the standard Java compiler on your desktop machine.<p>

But you must write to their API. It is a good API, though. Plenty of power and makes a lot of sense so far.<p>

The apps you create with it are cross-platform across PalmOS, WinCE, the standard JavaVM and web browsers, which is VERY attractive. And I mean <i>really</i> cross platform. No tweaking.<p>

I've been waiting for something like this for a long time. I've had my  Pilot for 18 months and never wrote code for it. I just can't deal with any more straight C non-OO code. I like classes.<p>
