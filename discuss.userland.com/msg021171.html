I'm just tired of hearing about the he said/she said/I meant. It sounds really tragic/urgent/exciting, when it's just a spec. (Jan Brady: "boring boring boring")</i><p>

Calvin, it matters to me, a lot.<p>

What you say here doesn't change that.<p>

The discussion is continuing. I'm going back-channel, finally someone from O'Reilly said something a little vulnerable, showing some flexibility, so I responded, privately.<p>

I hope that we can resolve this so you don't have to see a split at all. Things like this should never get so bad that they show up like this. I know it makes me look bad, but I think the other guys were counting on that. I don't like being bullied. I care that something that's good and right not be trampled. I won't stand by and say nothing. That's not me.<p>

You say you don't care about RSS. That's your right. But I do. <p>
