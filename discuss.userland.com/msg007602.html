I'm totally with you on making it easy to write.  I've worked with journalists on the web for four years and I know they don't want anything beyond the basic markup (those that do are prepared to learn, generally!).<p>

My ideal is a CMS suite that is quick and easy enough to use for writers and preserves more logical information (so us tool-writers and site producers can work all our transformations on it). There's a certain amount of logical activity that you want to do on a story as well as write it (add pictures, links, captions, headlines, bylines, datelines, references, sidebars) that is still too difficult/clunky without resorting to hacking HTML.  This is the sort of problem I'm keen to solve (of course with some effort this functionality can be developed - and I've done it in the past - but only in the specific, rather than reusable situation).<p>

On the second point, I agree that given the establishment of <scriptingNews&gt; this is not a good time to switch!  I had imagined that <scriptingNews&gt; might carry on just as it was.  I could envisage the full stories being referenced, perhaps in an <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xlink">XLink</A> like fashion, so the <scriptingNews&gt; files becomes an abstract with the option for the recipient software to either retrieve and integrate the content or to just present the abstract, as happens now.<p>

My concern really was that although it wouldn't complicate <scriptingNews&gt; too much at the moment to add some simple constructs for stories, if you didn't decide on a place to stop, it would rapidly want to expand to become something as expressive as XMLNews, for instance.  At the end you could end up with something similar.<p>

[A note about XMLNews: XMLNews is just one suggestion, from one group of people. It is an easier-to-use subset of the <I>News Industry Text Format</I> agreed by the European and US Newspaper/agency associations (IPTC and NAA).  It doesn't have too many <I>public</I> examples of roll-out at the moment (you can find them at <a href="http://www.xmlnews.org/users.html">http://www.xmlnews.org/users.html</a>) but one thing that's interesting is promised authoring support in the next generation of Corel's WordPerfect product.  I suspect that it will be under consideration by a lot of web producers coming from print media -- I know that at my (soon to be ex-)employer, the UK's <A href="http://www.pa.press.net/">Press Association</A>, it's actively under consideration for exporting content.]<p>

There's no reason why there oughtn't to be a <I><scriptingNewsStory&gt;</I> format, which supports directly those things that the Scripting News community needs, either.  As I said before I have no association with XMLNews and have had very little experience of using it.<p>

At the moment, although I author my raw content in XML, I have had to invent my own DTDs for it, which I only view as a temporary solution until there become some more accepted standards that are flexible enough for my needs. Maybe this discussion will be the start of one!<p>

I hope that has made some of my points clearer -- apologies for not being quite lucid enough the first time around.
