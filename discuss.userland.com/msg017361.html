In the terms of this particular discussion, security is only as good
as it's default settings. Eros may have the best security available,
but if one is not careful about permissions, etc, then the best
possible security won't help. That's why OpenBSD has such a good
reputation, they comb the code for problems and make sure the
permissions, etc, are properly set.<p>

(Correct me if I'm wrong, but, as far as I know, Eros is just barely
bootable, so it can't be used for anything practical at this point.)
