A reader, trying to read all of the messages in a thread, will eventually stumble upon these totally unrelated sub-threads, and burn brain cells determing they need to move on to the next message.<p>

I wonder what a usability expert or information architect would think about a site that didn't care about "where they put stuff", but instead relied on a search engine.<p>

Obviously, life goes on without a "new thread" feature, it'll be a neat experiment to see how/if this impacts usability as time goes on.<p>
