Who said that?<p>

What a time-waster. Now someone has to tell you that no one ever said that. <p>

FWIW, I had a peek behind the scenes at Netscape and they had a huge mess to clean up. Yes, it matters that they have a new code base. It must be horribly demoralizing to the team working on their product to have to put up with the kinds of pot-shots people take at them.<p>

I know how hard people can be on engineers. Do it somewhere else. Right now I'm getting pelted with messages just like the one you've posted here. I don't like it when it's done to me, and I like it no more when it's done to someone else. All those engineers at NS could quit and get new stock options elsewhere. We need a second and third and fourth browser if the web is going to be a market.
