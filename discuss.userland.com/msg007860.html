CS allows groups of writers, artists and designers to contribute to a Frontier-managed website using their favorite tools, thru email, FTP or file sharing. It's one of the earliest examples of web workflow in Frontier; CS 1.0 shipped in April 1997, the same month we started Scripting News.<p>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/catalog/display.asp?site=427&subid=22&pg=8">Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Pricing</a>. For a 25-client license, it's $1609. It's not clear if this means that the web server is limited to a certain number of threads. A page explaining the pricing for people wanting to use NT Server just as a web server would be helpful.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7875">William Crim says</a> "NT pricing is worse than you fear." Crim's bottom line, for a reasonable server with Microsoft's SQL database, software cost: $9126.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7866">Jim Flanagan</a>: "Deploying Linux in certain large-scale situations is a far cry from $free. Talented people must be employed making Linux do what you want. Linux is flexible. You can go where you want, provided you can understand the source, have the technical resources, and don't need to go there today."<p>

Microsoft's Ben Slivka writes in response to yesterday's DaveNet that they have a <a href="http://www.fmstocks.com/">benchmark dynamic site</a> implemented in VB, ASP and SQL running on NT. He suggests that this site be ported to other environments to compare scalability, time to develop, runtime characteristics. This is a positive step in the right direction. He says "Not an answer to your $1500 or even $5000 question, perhaps, but the
perf numbers look pretty good." To everyone else, think about it.<p>

Hey I tried to log into the site, but it didn't work. I guess they're <i>still diggin!</i><p>

<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/guns/gun-ethics.html">Eric Raymond</a>: "There is nothing like having your finger on the trigger of a gun to reveal who you really are. Life or death in one twitch -- ultimate decision, with the ultimate price for carelessness or bad choices." Yeah, here's what I learned, the one time in my life that I fired a gun. It scared the bejesus out of me. I don't want that kind of power in my hand. I don't trust myself with it.<p>

Upcoming DaveNet topic. Now that we have a <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain</a> for vendors, where's the Cluetrain for users? What responsibilities do users have when they have access to management and development staff of companies whose products they use? What can today's users do to help more companies come out from behind the firewall?</img>
