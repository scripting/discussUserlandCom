You still send them to the magazines, of course!<p>

There might be fewer, but in my experience, being mentioned in a magazine (electronic or paper) still gives you the biggest number of hits.<p>

In addition, you might want to try to seed educational facilities with free copies. My idea for my hosting service was to run a contest for the best concept for a site and then sponsor that site. Since everyone can get a free Weblogs or ETP site, this is probably not so efficient, but I am sure there is still something along those lines to be explored.<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
