One of the CDs I bought yesterday was Frank Zappa's Strictly Commercial, a greatest hits album. I thought this was appropriate, since Zappa, if he were alive, would probably be one of the biggest boosters of music on PCs. I don't know that for sure, obviously, just a guess.<br><br>	OK, next step. Here's what a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/rippedFolderStructure.gif">folder</a> produced by CDEX looks like.

I've said many of the same things about Mozilla. If there's to be an alternative to Microsoft's browser, it must behave exactly like it, the pain to transition to it must be absolutely at a minimum.<br><br><b>Software and the First Amendment<a name="softwareAndTheFirstAmendment">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/31#softwareAndTheFirstAmendment" title="Permanent link to 'Software and the First Amendment' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Dennis Wickham: "In 1999, Microsoft won a lawsuit here in San Diego because the Federal District Judge agreed with you that the First Amendment extends to choices made by developers in writing software. The case involved an inadvertent string of events that caused a user of Publisher 98 looking to images of 'monkeys' to pull up an African-American couple sitting on 'monkey bars.' The judge dismissed the lawsuit filed by a consumer ruling that the programing, even if it lead to unintended associations of ideas, were speech."<br><br><b>A time capsule<a name="aTimeCapsule">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/31#aTimeCapsule" title="Permanent link to 'A time capsule' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	In Web Techniques, <a href="http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/2000/08/redi/">Dale Dougherty reports</a> on the WWW9 conference in Amsterdam in May.<br><br>	"Given that publishing was in the title, and the fact that there were five other tracks available for the 500-plus developers, I wasn't expecting much interest.

In fact, chances are that you’re not a musician, so I’ll ask a different question: Do you expect to get paid for whatever work it is you do? Pardon me for presuming all of you aren’t socialists, but surely the answer must be yes."<br><br>	Considering that she already answered the question, let's back up and look at the assumptions she's made, and see where she took a wrong turn.<br><br>	If I was a musician I <i>would</i> want to get paid for my work. And she's right, I am not a musician. She's doing great so far.<br><br>	Now on to the next question. Do I expect to get paid for the work I do? The answer, sadly, is no. That's because I choose to be creative and honest, and writing software is even less appreciated an art than being a musician. I could take a job as the CEO or CTO of a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-201-2295320-0.html?tag=st.ne.1002.tgif.sf">slimy</a> dot-com startup and promote non-existent software and bribe reporters for good press coverage. I've had a few offers, but I turn them down with such gusto, the offers have stopped, which is OK with me. I choose to have integrity in the work I do. I also choose to write software. So money has to take a back seat. (She didn't ask if I'd <i>like</i> to get paid, the answer is an enthusiastic yes!)<br><br>	Most rock stars don't get paid very much, if anything, for the work they do, under the old system. That point has been made by quite a few artists, and hasn't been refuted by the music industry. Until they refute it, with facts that stand up to reasonable scrutiny, I'm going to believe the artists that have spoken publicly. So forget the bs about artists getting paid, when a reporter asks the question that way I wonder whose payroll they're on. Where are the  fact-checkers when you need one? Talk about music company execs getting paid, then the story has some basis in fact, afaik.<br><br>	Further, as I've said countless times but no one seems to hear, I pay for music. The stuff I download from Napster is stuff I've already paid for. How many times do I have to <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/06/19/whereDoISendTheMoney">pay</a> for it? <br><br>	(That's the question for Ms. Napoli.)<br><br><b>For Scripting News readers<a name="forScriptingNewsReaders">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/31#forScriptingNewsReaders" title="Permanent link to 'For Scripting News readers' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	It's time to lift the hood in a new way..<br><br>	I am personally net-negative on UserLand, to the tune of a few million dollars. During the flame war that resulted when Frontier went commercial in 1998, we computed that I had personally paid $3000 for every copy of Frontier in use. I paid for the priviledge of people using my software. (Which made the selfish flames all the more ridiculous.)<br><br>	The software distribution system forces developers to work for large companies, where there is diminished opportunity for artistic integrity. We learned in the early 90s that there was no way for a small company, even with a hot product, to net-out any money from software distribution. It was bad in the 80s, in the 90s it became impossible. It was cheaper to just give the software away, which is what we did in 1995.<br><br>	Privately, I urged Apple to revise the distribution system, since they were getting beat-up for having no software, and they were making good money in the early 90s. The pleas fell on deaf ears. I proposed a pool of five percent of revenue for the Macintosh, to be distributed to software developers based on usage ratings. The more your software got used, the more money you'd get. I still think this is a reasonable way to do it. Users want the software for free, so did the platform vendor, but it costs money to develop. Somehow this has to be resolved. No one has had the guts yet to do it. (This would be the equivalent of the artists having an equity stake in the studio.)<br><br>	Anyway, in twelve years I have never drawn a salary from UserLand. That's not true for the people who work here, who earn salaries and get stock options and benefits. In the above I carefully talk about me, not the company. We're not profitable, it would not make any sense for me to draw a salary. I'm not complaining, because since 1998 I haven't had to write any checks to UserLand. A lot of people assume we're rolling in dough, and we're not. That's one of the reasons I like that the music industry is bringing money into the discussion. Like the musicians, I want to be paid for giving people good stuff that does cool things, but only from honest people who like it.<br><br>	Like good music, good software is expensive to make. When you see something cool-but-free coming from UserLand, think about money, and the gift you're getting. You're not paying for it, but you're getting something that cost money to make.<br><br><b>Since it's disclosure time<a name="sinceItsDisclosureTime">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/31#sinceItsDisclosureTime" title="Permanent link to 'Since it's disclosure time' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	One more thing.<br><br>	At various times, we've had offers to sell Frontier.<br><br>	Each time, on investigation, we learned that the product would be dismembered, and pieces would be integrated with other products from the acquiring company.<br><br>	I always got angry at this point. "The beauty of Frontier is its integration. If you dismember it all its value goes away." <br><br>	If we had done any of these deals we would have sold out our users. They'd be left holding a piece of software that would never be updated, bugs never fixed, no new features released, new platforms not supported.<br><br>	I did that once, in the late 80s, the product died, and I hear from its users to this day, and it makes me angry and sad that the beautiful product died, for no good reason I could find. I decided that the art I do is far more important than money, and I resolved never to do it again.<br><br>	PS: This is <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$187">why</a> I do it.<br><br>
