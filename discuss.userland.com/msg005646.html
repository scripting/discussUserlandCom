It's requires a copy of each operating system you want to run. It's sort of like Apple's 68K emulator, but it emulates x86 hardware on top of x86 hardware.<p>

There's some slight-of-hand going on here. It doesn't emulate most instructions, it runs them on the real processor. But it does emulate other instructions.<p>

Like I said, a cool hack.<p>

Cheers, Eric
