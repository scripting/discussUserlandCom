That's interesting; my attitude is that when a Web site does a major change, it should be all at once; get the change over with, so people can get used to it as quickly as possible. If you draw out the transitional state, people don't know what's happening.</P>
<P>That having been said, I'm a big fan of iterative design -- aka endless tweaking.</P>
<P>Personally, I think the new Macintouch is worse - the wide columns of text with no right margin are hard to read.</p>
