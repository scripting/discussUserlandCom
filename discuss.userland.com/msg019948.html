It says two things - <p>

1) if you improve the enhydra code, you have to make the improvements available<p>

2) you might build something which uses enhydra as is - a "larger work", if you do this, just pass on the unmodified enhydra code and license your additions anyway you like.<p>

This "larger work" bit is the key thats missing from the GPL and it prevents a lot of folx who are trying to build larger systems from using GPL code.
