Say I post an xml-rpd (remote procedure definition) of a way to create tables via some argument. You get as a return via the xml-rpc call a nicely formatted table in html.  Then say joe at his ETP site saw this nice webdjet and used it in his own to create a calendar - built on top of it.  Then say sara decided to use this on her ETP site as her personal calendar, via some macro call.<p>

Then say travelocity, who is outside the framework, learns of this calendar and it's xml-rpc api. They set up a service where when you book tickets, it automatically sends an RPC call to your personal calendar and adds the plane trip dates.<p>

gee, someday ...
