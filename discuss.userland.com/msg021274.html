<p> <b>Dave -- I hope you'll reconsider. </b><p>

<p> I've been a longtime reader of Scripting News ( and DaveNet
by email long before that. ) but I don't read very deep in the 
discussions -- the browser interface is just to inefficient. <p>

<p> I posted a question in   <<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20963">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20963</a>>.
I didn't get a response there, but the question's been answered
in this thread and elsewhere. ( the info I wanted was the mapping of messages into the xml file namespace as 
<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader.xml$nnnn">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader.xml$nnnn</a> ) <p>

<p>As a user interface, discuss.userland.com stinks. 
I haven't griped about it before because it's not much worse than
other web based discussion formats.   ( See Jon Udell's article 
for detailed gripes. )  <p>

<p> I would think you would be happy to have someone else do
the work to make your forum more accessible.  <p>

I'm not going to demand a silly consistency  -- there's a lot of 
grey areas in all of this  -- but I suggest you meditate a moment
on your stand on this topic vs. your views on Napster,  "Data Captivity in WebApps",  Cluetrain ( marketing/managers obsession with control of information, like Apple's hunt for 
leakers who IMHO provide a service for Apple customers that
Apple doesn't seem to be able to provide. )  <p>
