How about a <a href="http://www.cddb.com/">CDDB</a> gateway?<p>

Normally I don't post business plans on the DG, but there's an hour until my next class and I'm bored, so...<p>

Amazon brought us the definitive site for books, but there's no such thing for music. (Music is the only thing I buy on a regular basis...)<p>

What I want is a site that has the information (including lyrics) for every song on every album in the last 20 years (if not the last 50). I also want to be able to listen to any song with one click. I also want to be able to buy any CD or a custom mix CD. Of course, if I was paying to access such a service I'd also want an XML-RPC interface. I don't want to go to multiple sites, I don't want ads, I don't want to download plug-ins or applications, and I don't want to hear about half-baked copy-protection schemes or the latest convoluted copyright law.<p>

Now back to your regularly-scheduled discussion of scripting, XML, and space aliens...
