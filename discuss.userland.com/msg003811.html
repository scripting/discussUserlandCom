I wanted to post this here in case anyone was interested - it might make a good exercise to create something in frontier that parses this every hour or so and creates a site. It's slashdot's back end view which it provides for others to use as a "thumbnail" view of it's site.  Sort of like how scripting.com has an xml view...<p>

Just an fyi and perhaps fodder for someone testing stuff in frontier 6.
