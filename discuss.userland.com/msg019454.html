If I buy with a credit card, I can stop payment if I don't get the merchandise. But if I already have the pattern (song, Stephen King chapter...) and I'm just contributing after the fact, I don't have to worry about that.<p>Since there's a chicken-and-egg problem with getting digital cash deployed, maybe voluntary payments will be the killer app that really kicks it off.
