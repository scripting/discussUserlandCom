He describes the various approaches to ad distribution/sharing and reviews commercial and free programs for same. He also has a number of articles and other reviews related to web advertising.<p>

There's a search engine (at bottom of the left or right column), so you can search for his evaluation and recommendation on a specific program, among other things.<p>

It's worth a look.<p>
