I want to create a new top-level discussion that shows up as a link in this discussion.<p>

It's easy to make a messaging system that lets lots of people post messages and replies and so on.  Its interesting to make a system where people can navigate through large numbers of messages to find what they want.  Its a killer app when the navigation and information management becomes an intuitive tool.<p>

I don't think that any product really nails this today (but I certainly haven't used them all :-)<p>
