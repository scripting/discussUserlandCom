The term "cross-platform UI" is somewhat misleading. UI designers will be able to create UI descriptions which
will work on multiple platforms. But proper UI descriptions which take into account various platforms' differing
ideas about proper placement of such things as dialog buttons will require some platform-specific work. A single
XUL specification can only cross-platform to a degree. UI designers and build engineers will need to maintain
separate, platform-specific versions of at least some XUL documents.

But at least it's just a text file, and not separate cpp files you have to recompile.  I wonder if they could make xul work for dumb ascii terminals as well?  That would be wierd.
