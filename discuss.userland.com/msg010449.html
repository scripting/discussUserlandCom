New channel: <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1271">FreshMeat.Net</a>. <i>Yaha!</i><p>

<a href="http://www.honeylocust.com/limon/xml/">HoneyLocust</a>: "Static web pages work fine with older browsers, and allow one to insulate oneself from the falling bombs and shells of the browser wars."<p>

I reorganized the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">home page</a> of the Frontier site, pulling up the summaries from the Tour pages, and linking to screen shots. For some reason I get inspired when I know a lot of people are looking at one of my sites!<p>

<a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/">42 new pages</a> on the Frontier site, and the night is still young. That must be some kind of record, and proof that the Frontier site is no longer read-only. <p>

2:22PM: Not to tempt anyone, but here we are many hours after rolling out the new pricing program, and no flames. <i>Thanks!</i><p>

<a href="http://www.lists.ic.ac.uk/hypermail/xml-dev/xml-dev-Sep-1999/0287.html">A message I posted</a> on the XML-DEV list announcing the XML-RPC interface for discussion groups. "For UserLand, this is the back-end for our editorial groupware system, and a new web writer's tool we have in development. But the interface can be used for all kinds of workflow and groupware. The more the merrier!"<p>

<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$314">Steven Livingstone</a> is leading a group who is wiring up MS-Word thru COM to be an editor for DG postings.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10450">Jeremy Bowers</a>: "Scraping may produce the same <i>information</i> as a hypothetical RSS file, it cannot produce the same <i>permission.</i>"<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10452">Dave Winer</a>: "From what I know about webmasters at big publishing companies (we're working with a few of them) -- their management will not understand the issue when it pops up to their level. When they learn about scraping, I believe their first response is going to be to sue, and it may be tough to talk them out of it."<p>

<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/306419.asp">MSNBC</a>: "As a matter of course, we don’t knowingly sell a company’s name to competitors," says Diane Hunt, a Yahoo spokeswoman, but she notes that some cases fall through the cracks."<p>

<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/21560.html">Wired</a>: "Two days after rival Sun Microsystems unveiled a plan to publish word processing and spreadsheet applications for free over the Web, Microsoft executives said they're considering a similar strategy."<p>

I got an email in response to this <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10222">post</a>, saying that HTML doesn't count because it is not a Turing Machine. Of course that's true, I'm not sure its Turing-ness matters, but then I had a thought this morning that the purpose of <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> is to turn the Internet into a Turing Machine. I liked that description because it is so concise, assuming you know <a href="http://obiwan.uvi.edu/computing/turing/work.htm">what a Turing Machine is</a>.<p>
