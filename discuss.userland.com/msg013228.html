If you purchase Frontier now, you will get 6.0, which does not contain Manila.<p>

We have been testing Manila both with Frontier users, and with people using sites hosted on UserLand.Com servers.<p>

We are also running a site and a mail list for Manila-Newbies, in preparation for the release of 6.1. We want to be ready with people able to answer questions and help find solutions to problems.<p>

We thought Manila would ship this week, but we wanted to take care of a couple of things that will be hard to fix once it's widely deployed.<p>

We're debating whether we should release next week, considering that it's one of the biggest US holidays next Thursday, and we weren't sure if many people would be able to use it over the holiday. No matter what we're going to get it out before December 1.
