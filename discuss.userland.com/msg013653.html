The direction I see those environments evolving will be assembling systems out of big components. So you use a system such as Documentum to handle versioning and workflow. Editors use XML editors like things from Arbor Text. Database use Oracle cartridges to get XML in and out. You serve off of Apache or ISS using off the shelf modules to do XML transforms on the server.<p>

You don't have to spend the money on the Vignete or Broadvisions, but you will probably bring in consultants to help you figure out which pieces to assemble and do the knowledge transfer to your IT staff.
