I found a screenshot in the <A HREF="http://www.scripting.com/contentServer/managingTemplates.html">ContentServer docs</A>, but nothing else.<p>

I suppose one would have to edit GoLive's web database so it wouldn't mess with #directives and &#123;macros()}.<p>

The screenshot seems to have #directives encapsulated in HTML comment; I guess this could be fixed at render time with a firstfilter.<p>

I love GoLive's approach to editing both layout and source, but moving templates manually into the odb is time-consuming.  I'd like to see Frontier streamline the visual template-editing process as it's done for page-writing.<p>

PS: I guess the energy now is going into XML-RPC implementations.  This is totally the way to go, but I'm hoping that I can get AppleEvents working for me in the very near future.
