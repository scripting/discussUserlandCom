There are <i>individuals on Slashdot</i> who provide useful information about Linux-related issues, without ranting or knee-jerking.  For someone who is new to Linux, it's probably easier to find such people on Slashdot than just about anywhere else -- and you can find them discussing these matters with each other, and you can see where they seem to have a consensus.  In that sense, I suppose you could treat Slashdot as authoritative.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/">Christopher B. Browne</a> has a site with a lot of computer-related information, essays, and links, including a sober and well-written <a href="http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/linux.html">Linux page</a>.  I don't know if this meets your criteria for a good Linux page, but try it.
<p>
Also, the <a href="http://lwn.net">Linux Weekly News</a> puts out a good digest of Linux-related news.</p></p>
