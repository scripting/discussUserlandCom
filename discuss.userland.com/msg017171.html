Clicked on the Pike button in the browser and the outline opened in Pike. Made a change. Saved. Refreshed in the browser. It works.<p>

Now the next step is to figure out how to get people the bits they need for Pike to enable the feature. A very small download, probably about 1K. But it's going to be totally overwritten by an official Pike update.<p>

It was pretty straightforward on the server. I do not do anything with custody nor do I bother to verify that username and password are valid. Also some opportunities to factor some code. This is just proof of concept.<p>

<b>The scripts that changed were:</b><p>

1. mainresponder.discuss.readmessage (new code is well isolated)<p>

2. manilasuite.rpchandlers.message.editinpike (a new handler)<p>

I have a 2PM meeting, so I'm going to try to get a test site ready asap.
