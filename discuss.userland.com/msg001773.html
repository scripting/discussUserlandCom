It was very logical. Once we had experience with the website framework #attributes, it made sense to do the same thing for the server. Just following the lay of the land, only later did I realize that they were come *at each other*, doing something very different. It's gratifying to know that the First Class designers got to the same place. I've never been to this place before, myself although this isn't the first time I've done a discussion group. Dave
