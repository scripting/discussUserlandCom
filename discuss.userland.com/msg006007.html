The major difference b/w now and then is that unlike Russia, before the embassy bombing, while the Chinese government opposed the air strikes, they were not seriously interested in putting a lot of effort into this. But they can no longer do that because of the internal pressure that they are getting from the public. Now they cannot back down w/o getting a reasonable compensation from US/NATO, if they do so, anger may turn to them instead.<p>

IMHO, unless the strike ends now, nothing is going to resolve the crisis. It must stop now and then the two countries can sit down and talk.
