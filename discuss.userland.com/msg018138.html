I guess I'm not clear on what you mean by a "standard garbage collector for VC++."  The nature of C++ (and C for that matter) does not lend itself to any generalized garbage collection mechanism.  The closest you could get is with a bolt-on library that could front-end a subset of memory management routines, such as overloading new(), but you'd still have to contend with a bunch of memory that was being allocated via different allocation methods.  There is no low hanging fruit here.  If there was, it would've been already done.<p>

In terms of standards conformance, the holiest of the C++ religious wars, VC++ is not so bad.  Version 6.0 scored 93% on Plum-Hall's C++ conformance suite. I've also found their STL implementation to be exceptionally strong.<p>

I think of C# as a "supercharged" Java.  Rather than continuing on in their pissing match with Sun, they chose to zig and add value where they know developers will appreciated it - performance and flexibility.<p>

As to your arguments in regards to "why bother switching", I generally agree.  I'm still rather puzzled by the legions of developers who jumped on the Java bandwagon.<p>

The area that I think C# will add the most value is in server based web applications.  Negotiating the treacherous COM threading models in C++ is tricky business, C# looks like it could be of some assistance here.<p>
