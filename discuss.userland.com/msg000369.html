About Apple getting in the loop, I spoke with Steve Zellers today, and he's interested. Steve is on the Java team, I've known him for many years, and he's totally up to writing a shared library for expat. <p>

I also emailed with the lead engineer for AppleScript, Rich Nygord, who I have also known for many years (he was at cc:mail, then Lotus) and he agreed that they should support XML.<p>

Something interesting is happening, people I like are starting to show up at Apple! Amazing..<p>

Also, to familiarize yourself with Microsoft's XML work, start by browsing their XML site:<p>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/xml/">http://www.microsoft.com/xml/</a><p>

And then continue your browsing at W3C and count the Microsoft names on all the specs. They've usually got at least one or two people in every group.<p>

<a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a><p>

This technique is called "swarming". ;-><p>
