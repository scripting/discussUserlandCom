That's what we just shipped today. A glue table for a scriptable app. No different, except that the app is on the web.<p>

XML-RPC is no different from Apple Events, it's too tacky not to hide with a glue script. <p>

And Don Box is doing the equivalent of 'aete's for web apps.<p>

Big wheel keep on turning.
