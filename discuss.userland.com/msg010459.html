<i>Scrapers -- don't know about profit, the content is published, but the present a significant quantity of the original, i.e. all the headlines from a single source, and they contribute positively to the market for the original.</i><p>

I've been thinking along much the same lines. The portion of the content scrapped probably affects the legality of scraping. For example, consider the daily updates page at Linux Weekly News:<p>

<a href="http://lwn.net/daily/">http://lwn.net/daily/</a><p>

This page is similar to the top-level Scripting News page. It has no headlines, just categories and one paragraph news items. Rumor also suggests that this page generates a healthy revenue stream (from the ads).<p>

Scraping this page would probably run afoul of copyright law. You'd probably end up taking 100% of their original content, and deprive them of their advertising revenue. Similarly, scraping Slashdot for the one-paragraph summaries (not just the headlines) would not be cool.<p>

Cheers,<br>
