We're trying to use the CHtmlView class to display HTML in Frontier. Since Frontier is not an MFC app, it's necessary to use this class from within an external DLL.<p>

Since Frontier can, and already does, load and call methods in external
DLLs written with MFC, this should be possible.<p>

Now, in a DLL I can get an hwnd to the Frontier window in which I want to display HTML, by using FindWindow.<p>

So, in the DLL code I have on one hand the hwnd, and on the other hand the CHtmlView class. How can I get the two to meet? I want to tell Windows: create an instance of the web browser control in the window whose hwnd I have.<p>

Or is there another approach that would make more sense?
