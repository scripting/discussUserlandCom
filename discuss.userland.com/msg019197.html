Find a used or indie record store. One that has interesting music, and that is less directly connected to the RIAA than the industry outlet stores.<p>

On the specified day, descend on the store, and buy their inventory. It would support an important and undervalued segment of the industry, it would put less money in the RIAA's pockets, and it would be a good publicity stunt.<p>
