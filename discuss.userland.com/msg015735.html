(Totally possible since I'm rather delusional due to my flu medicine..)<p>

If you compare the scriptingnews2.xml file from my weblogs.com site at <a href="http://mike.weblogs.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml">http://mike.weblogs.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml</a> to the .xml file over at <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml">http://scriptingnews.userland.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml</a> you'll notice that each item on the mike.weblogs.com site is registered as a single item entry with the appropriate markup for links, etc. The scriptingnews.userland.com file is representing the whole news page with one item entry and the paragraphs seperated by double breaks. <p>

Also, when you view the scriptingnews channel on my.userland.com it only is displaying on bullet for the whole shebang.<p>

Anyways, I'm thinking since Dave started using Pike on his site, things don't jive anymore?
