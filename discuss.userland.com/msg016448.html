The quality/type of writing is rarely influenced by the tools being used. That is, it's impossible to tell when reading a novel whether the author wrote is longhand, typed it, wordprocessed it, etc.<p>

Art is different. In many cases you look at a work of art and can tell immediately at least some of the tools involved (either traditional or computer based).<p>

Microsoft has never been sufficiently creative at a level that would have allowed them to satisfy the artistic market - and this will never, ever change, IMO. But for writing, the threshold is different - not because writers are less demanding than artists, but because the quality of work is influenced less by the tool they are using.
