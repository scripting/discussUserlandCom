Right now I would only advise using examples.getstatenames, because the applet is forcing you to call a script with 4 variables. You can change the server though, and the state numbers.<p>

You'll need the latest version of Shockwave (7), because it is the only one that supports XML parsing and has an http client. Also, since the shockwave applet is being served from designframe.com, while the rpc call is to userland.com, you should get a security alert.<p>

There is still alot of work to do on the client code, but this demo shows that it is workable.<p>
