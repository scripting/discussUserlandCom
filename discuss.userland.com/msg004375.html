A lot of sites have interfaces to let people submit information, but it's another question to how sites delete or remove your information form a database.<p>

One example which is not unique, Excite (<a href="http://www.excite.com/privacy_policy/#deleting">http://www.excite.com/privacy_policy/#deleting</a>):<p>

"Again, it is not currently possible for an Excite customer to delete or deactivate their information from the database. However, when we can offer you the ability to update your own personally identifiable information, we will also be able to allow you to deactivate this information, if you so desire."
