I don't really care if someone steals 5 cents from me, or at least not enough to make my computer into a fortress. Heck, I don't care if they steal $49.99, that's the limit on my potential loss today with credit cards. On the other hand, an artist depending on a steady stream of 5 cent deposits into her account does care about security. If it costs 1 cent to process a transaction with this assymetrical security constraints, the artist presumably would love the 4 cents deposited in her account just as much as a 5 cents deposit. Sounds to me like a great opportunity for an Internet based business, payment processing.</i><p>

I agree completely. The key insight behind Millicent IMO is its relative lack of security. By reducing the risk, they eliminated the need for elaborate security schemes. The semi-offline structure of the system also reduces overhead costs.<p>

I've often thought about starting a Millicent broker, but I've been busy, Sand Hill Road is a bit far from here";->", and I'm not sure if Compaq is willing to license their patent.
