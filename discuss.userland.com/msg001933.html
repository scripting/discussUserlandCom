My reason for wanting to talk with them was to promote the idea of cooperation on XML-RPC. I regularly check in at the alphaWorks site and think it's just a matter of time before some researchers at IBM come out with their own way to do distributed computing using XML and HTTP. Since it's so early in this technology, I wanted to see if we could be compatible.<p>

We had a great talk, and I sent a pointer to our XML-RPC spec into the IBM aether, so maybe something interesting will happen. I'm always surprised to find out who's reading Scripting News. Maybe it can be a force for good among the giants of our industry! We'll see..<p>
