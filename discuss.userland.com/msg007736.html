Right now it's mostly a framework: you can plug in various ODBs, but there isn't a finished ODB. There's some minimal support for running Python and Scheme scripts. There's a minimal GUI to browse the ODB, and the GUI talks to the engine (Cairo) over the network so that they can be on separate machines (possibly running different OSes because both parts are written in Java). However, you can't edit or run scripts in the GUI. There are Java, Python, and Perl versions of LDO, a simple binary RPC protocol.<p>

So far nobody is building any apps on Casbah yet.
