However, if my e-mail address ever changes, losing my stored preferences on Userland's sites are only going to be a very small part of the total aggravation that I will have to deal with as part of the changeover.  If this is of concern to you, there are at least a few companies which will provide permanent email aliases for a nominal fee.  I have three ( that I hardly use :-) and it cost me a total of $15/yr.  If I were to use them as my primary public addresses, and my actual email mailbox ever changed, the switchover would be transparent.<p>

Maybe you all think this is a problem that needs to be solved in the discussion group software.  Maybe it is.  But it isn't the only way to solve the problem.  And the alternate way of solving the problem is one that a) you can do today and b) will save you additional hassels if your email address ever changes.
