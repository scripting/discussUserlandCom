I've been thinking about this whole Napster-vs-Metallica thing, and it occurs to me that everyone seems to have squandered lots of opportunities. Opportunities to talk and listen instead of sue on Metallica's part, opportunities to listen, incorporate artists' concerns and accommodate on Napster's part.<p>

Metallica's Lars Ulrich self-admits to being not very well informed about the Internet and Napster. The only aspect he sees (according to his words) is how it is a pirating tool. How it drives a wedge between him and his fans. There's no recognition on his part of how this could be an awesome tool for his well established band to reach more, younger people and keep their music alive for another generation. There's no identification with his position eighteen years ago when him and Metallica were just a drifting band of talented musicians without a big-three recording contract. How many bands would love to use the same technique they used eighteen years ago, transliterated to the current Internet times, to land that notoriety and big contract, to generate that "buzz"? There's no admission on his part that there are artists whose only hope of recognition lies in tools like Napster.<p>

On Napster's part the squandering of opportunities is equally bad if not worse. Seeing what was coming down the line, they could have invited Lars or the whole band down to San Mateo, sat them down over latte and chocolate cookies in front of the monitors, and <i>shown</i> them what Napster can do. Yes, it allows pirating. Yes, its unprotected, unruly, scruffy and chaotic. But it also gives you access to audiences in a new way. There <i>are</i> ways to control the content, there will always be pirates, and we can work with you to make it happen. Then Napster should have listened to Lars when he worries aloud about loss of control, about protecting their livelihood and about their IP rights. And <i>acknowledge</i> that these are real problems and promise to work with him and other artists to accommodate their issues and concerns.<p>

Is it too late now? Are we doomed to see only more and more litigation? Will everyone just keep climbing higher and higher up their tree?<p>

Here's one for hoping it ain't so.
