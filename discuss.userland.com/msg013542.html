(Win is later, but it's lots bigger.)</i><p>

Actually, Mozilla is later. Win2K betas have shipped, but the Mozilla alpha hasn't shipped yet.<p>

MS has set a ship date of February for Win2K. At that date, it's probably going to be released before Mozilla goes beta.<p>

And speaking of vaporware--does anyone have a copy of "Microserfs" by Douglas Coupland? All my books are (1) packed, and (2) thousands of miles away. If you do, could you post the quote about "SeaMonkey" as a product code name? It's near the beginning, IIRC.
