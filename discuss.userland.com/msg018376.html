One problem with Napster is that it fights the marketing interests of the labels. Keep in mind that control of free music distribution is in the hands of very few people. Between TV and radio, only a few companies are involved.<p>

The labels are able to very closely control what gets released when. It's not unlike how movies are released - timing and exposure is everything. Napster blows all of these plans to hell.<p>

People can truly evaluate what they want to hear and every artist gets equal exposure. It's a marketing nightmare.
