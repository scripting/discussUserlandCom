You can test that out at <a href="http://www.chalcedony.com/scripts/userlandtest.html">http://www.chalcedony.com/scripts/userlandtest.html</a>, which uses the onkeyup handler without any Java.<p>

In terms of Java talking to JavaScript and vice versa, that's straightforward. Check out either Chapter 9 of "JavaScript for the World Wide Web: Visual QuickStart Guide, 2nd Edition" or Chapter 11 in "Java for the World Wide Web: Visual QuickStart Guide". The former discusses the JavaScript side and the latter the Java side of the equation. I'll admit up front that I'm biased and wrote both, but it's very useful and not difficult.<p>

You can find out more about the Java book at <a href="http://www.chalcedony.com/java/">http://www.chalcedony.com/java/</a> and more about the JavaScript book at <a href="http://www.chalcedony.com/javascript/">http://www.chalcedony.com/javascript/</a>.<p>
