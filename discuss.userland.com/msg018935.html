One had to fax/mail a copy of the manual page containing the serial number to the vendor you were purchasing the upgrade from, then you would be sent an upgrade CD/disk.<p>

One way around the <i>new</i> find it on your hard drive routine is the option that Adobe gives you to insert a floppy (I've got a USB Mac, so that's not an option) or a CD-ROM with an older version of the software. (This involves a CD-ROM swap like the old days of floppy swapping to install an app - kinda nostalgic.)The install/upgrade will go fine from there.
