Definitely not. They would lose business customers if that was the case.  But, if you sign your XUL, you will have greater  access and part of that access is changing the UI.<p>

What I dont want to happen though is going to far with that too so that some kind of UI is "hard wired" into the browser.  Id rather live iwth a little changeability than no changeability.<p>

Just another thought - I can easily see XUL extensions for Dreamweaver or Homesite or another UI authoring tool.  I think XUL is really empowering, and not bringing the web into the UI.  Once the "skins" fad plays out - I imagine seeing some really innovative stuff happening with UI / browser development.<p>
