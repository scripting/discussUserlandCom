I agree with Dave that it'd be nice to have a standard HTML rendering library built into MacOS; it's a shame Apple hasn't provided one.<p>

But isn't this what we call an opportunity?  Surely there's something to be gained from writing a good set of libraries or a plugin for HTML rendering on the Mac.<p>

Or, of course, we can just wait till Gecko's ready for prime time.
