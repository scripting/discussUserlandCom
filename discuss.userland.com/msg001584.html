Oh baby would I love that! <p>

I was hoping I'd hear from you on that! I was taking a stab in the dark, figuring that ASC was the same mechanism that IIS used to implement ASPs. I could be full of it, it wouldn't be the first time.<p>

Re your other comments, the times are very different. We shipped Frontier a couple of years before Apple shipped AppleScript. In the Windows market there are lots of people who know VB Script and JavaScript, Perl, Tcl, etc. <p>
