The signature element is there: 'please send this letter to as many people as you can.' It's like a virus hoax.<p>

I doubt it was developed by the Gore campaign, but I also would bet at stiff odds that it was started by a Gore supporter.<p>

<b><u>Analysis</u></b><p>
Granted, Cheney has proven not to be a big asset to the campaign. Granted, Powell or McCain would be a much more compelling ticket-mate. But if either of them had been available, interested and acceptable, they would have been the pick in the first place, and we wouldn't be sitting here discussing Cheney.<p>

What has changed that would make either of them interested in the nomination now? Yes, <b>party loyalty </b> is a minimally plausible answer, but still quite improbable.<p>

Quayle was a much more serious liability, and he didn't get dumped, not even the second time around (though I think there was real consideration within the party and Bush team of replacing him on the ticket the second time).<p>

<u><b>Tangent</b></u>
<p>I deplore urban legends. Many people seem to think they are harmless, even fun. I disagree. Tall tales (e.g., Paul Bunyan) ARE harmless fun. The difference is that everybody knows tall tales are just tales. Many people accept urban legends as truth.<p>

We are blessed to live in a safe, secure, rich, largely tolerant, diverse nation. So urban legends here don't tend to work too much mischief. However, I maintain that it is not such a great leap from urban legends such as this, to toxic mythology, such as:
<p>"The mark of Satan is upon Jews; they have horns under their curly hair"</p>
<p>"Croats eat Serbian children" and vice-versa</p>
<p>"International adoptions that bring children to the United States are a cover--those children are brought in so their organs can be harvested"</p>
<p>"These Salem women are witches"</p>
<p>Free vaccination problems are a plot by the government to kill poor children</p>
