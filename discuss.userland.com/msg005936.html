I've installed Caldera 1.1, RH 5.0, and RH 5.2 on several different machines, including an old Toshiba Laptop, and found it to be surprisingly painless. Getting X to work on the laptop was tricky, but eventually I found someone else who had done it and voila! Not having much of a unix background (and certainly not installing or maintaining unix), there were a lot of things to learn, and quite a few to unlearn.<p>

Things that helped me:<p>

<ol>
<li>Reading the installation guide. I successfully installed RH without the guide, which was a litmus test of sorts, but then I went back and did it again with the guide and picked up some important subleties.
<li>Doing a full install, so that all the software was installed. I did partial installs and found myself going back to the CD many times to get additional packages. The first time around it's much easier to install everything.
<li>Hitting the <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/mirrors.html">Linux Documentation Project</a> (LDP). The HOW-TO's provide an amazing level of technical details. Sometimes "more than I wanted to know", but the expertise here is phenomenal. Much more depth than similar docs I've seen from commercial products
<li>After mucking around for a few weeks, compiling software, making mistakes, and generally doing everything I could to destroy my system  --short of running rm -rf /* as root-- and finding that it continued to work, I wiped it all and started again. The second time around was less painful and I learned a lot more. 
<li>Biting the bullet and learning Emacs (I flipped a coin and Emacs won over vi). Initially I used PICO since it was brain dead easy, but it didn't take long to find out that I needed a more powerful editor. 
<li>Switching to a better window manager. I understand RH 6.0 comes with KDE and GNOME/Enlightenment, so this isn't as critical anymore. But the stuff that RH 5.2 ships with is awful. Afterstep is OK, but it wasn't configured the way I wanted it and I eventually switched to Window Maker.
</ol><p>

Things that did <i>not</i> help:<p>

<ol>
<li>Coming to Linux with an NT mentality. Unix has a fundamentally different design from NT and most other OSes, and while I understood that, I hadn't really come to grips with it until I had to install and administer my own Linux box. I had to unlearn the NT way of doing many things. Pros and cons on both sides.
<li>Thinking "this will be easy". There are so many different combinations of hardware that installing on some machines is much simpler than any other OS, and on others a complete nightmare. Not that easy to predict if it will work. If your attitude is "this will be hard", then at worst you'll meet expectations and have a good chance of being pleasantly surprised. In most cases installation is pretty easy, but I agree with Eric -- there is often one card that causes problems.
<li>Believing Linux is a replacement desktop system. Not yet. Reviews say that Caldera 2.2 and RH 6.0 are a monstrous step in the right direction thanks to KDE and GNOME. But I still find myself doing a lot of "desktop end user" type stuff on NT.
