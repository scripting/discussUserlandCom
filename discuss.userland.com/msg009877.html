I find that killfiles are the best way to make sure that messages (at least those you read) stay roughly on topic.<p>

So how hard would that be to do filtering with Frontier in this DG?  All that would be necessary would be a match by subject (e.g., filter everything that has "Marijuna" in the subject) or by thread (filter everything in this thread, for instance)...
