Frontier does implement Asynch RPC on the client end. <p>

Unfortunately SMTP does not have guaranteed delivery. </i><p>

UDP doesn't either, but it's still a useful constuct. In fact, it could be useful to have a udp based xml-rpc for tasks such as logging.<p>

It would be reasonably trivial to map an xml-rpc message to an SMTP message.  Path == username, the body of the message could be the method call. The sending machine would not get acknolegement except through side effects.<p>
