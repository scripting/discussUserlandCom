Such as most of Europe, where prices range somewhere between $4 and $5 a gallon. But that's by-the-bye. The US Energy Secretary summed it up: the world uses 36 million barrels of oil a day, but only 34 million are being "produced" each day, due primarily to OPEC's production quotas. Shortfall creates demand; demand increases prices. If you're a "hostage" to anything, it's capitalism.<p>

The reason I mention Europe, is that we've adapted to higher fuel prices. Smaller, more fuel-efficient cars make sense in that kind of economy: it's a maxim that could apply across the board. Cut the fat. Adapt.
