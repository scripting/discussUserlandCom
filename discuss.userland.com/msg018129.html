I was hoping, when I first saw reports of this, that C|Net's reporter had conflated new features of Visual Studio 7 with the old COOL rumors, and that the other reports were just cribbing off of C|Net. Unfortunately, that's not true.</i><p>

C# has a number of virtues (and some random oddities). To make a long story short, it's a slightly tweaked relative of Java, and it claims to play nicely with existing C code. It uses native compilation, of course.<p>

The manual doesn't mention SOAP or XML <i>at all</i> (although it talks about COM quite a bit). So I'm guessing the XML support must live in a standard library somewhere.<p>

So, if:<p>

<ul>
<li>Your application runs on Windows,</li>
<li>You need to work with COM,</li>
<li>and you'd like something vaguely like Java, but compiled...</li>
</ul><p>

...C# might be a good idea. You could probably modify an existing C/C++ compiler to support C# (using the same techniques Cygnus used to implement GCJ), and use the <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/">Boehm GC</a> to get garbage collection running.<p>

If Microsoft pushes hard enough, we'll probably see C# everywhere. Expect amazing amounts of hype, most of which will be even more misleading than Sun's. ;-)<p>
