     For our 1999 kick-off presentation, Dr. Rita Knox, Vice President and
     Research Director at the Gartner Group will offer her insights on the
     following:<p>

     Extensible Markup Language (XML) is talked about for applications that
     go well beyond what is heard for SGML. This talk describes the
     foundational XML "family of standards" that makes this ubiquity
     possible, and highlights emerging and potential applications including
     a few of special interest to publishers.<p>

     For our vendor presentation, Interleaf Inc. will demonstrate their
     groundbreaking XML application, BladeRunner.<p>

     "BladeRunner is an Enterprise Content Management application that
     encompasses the entire content lifecycle, including content creation,
     content repository and publishing. Based on an XML data model, it is
     designed to improve the flow of information across organizations and
     facilitate business transactions. BladeRunner contains an object
     oriented content repository that stores, maintains and manages XML
     content, DTD's, XSL stylesheets and related objects. XML documents are
     "burst" into discrete "chunks" when they are checked into the
     repository to facilitate reuse."
