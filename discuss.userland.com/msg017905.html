I'd like to send money directly to Buddy Miles. </i><p>

Does Buddy have the right to assign a future revenue stream to someone else in exchange for cash now? Or to have someone aggregate the pennies on his behalf? <p>

Does Buddy arrange to pay the other artists who played backup? <p>

There's gotta be some sort of intermediary that can let you act on your gratitude, let the artist focus on their craft, and take care of the artist's business (sans ripoff). <p>

I thought, for a while, that ASCAP was well positioned to do this. They do clearances and such. But they've been so quiet... <p>

This reminds me of the lyrics databases (lyricsdb.se?) that were raided after ASCAP sued (called them pirates) a few years' ago. They let you contribute lyrics, your transcription, to the database, the way <a href="http://imdb.com/">http://imdb.com/</a> let you add movies and reviews. <p>

On the other hand, today's <a href="http://www.lyrics.ch/">http://www.lyrics.ch/</a> and <a href="http://songfile.snap.com/">http://songfile.snap.com/</a> are centrally edited. They deliver a picture of the lyrics through a java applet so you don't copy them, print them, or really have time to read them. No deep linking, of course. And they have the chutzpah to charge for sheet music. <p>

btw, music publishers don't have a standard needledrop rate for web audio clips. don't know why when they have them for all kinds of other, less common uses. <a href="http://www.nmpa.org/hfa/ratecurrent.html">http://www.nmpa.org/hfa/ratecurrent.html</a><p>
