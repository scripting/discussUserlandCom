As this trend toward guest dbs continues, I'm wondering what becomes of the suites and user tables in the Frontier.root.<p>

I'd like to get to the point where I'm running a stock Frontier.root, and all my code is in guest dbs.  I think this is the general goal that Userland is encouraging also, no?<p>

I can certain create suites.root and user.root and work from that for my own purposes, but I'm wondering if we should try to generate a community consensus on what the proper storage locations for non-site-specific code should be.  It would make it a lot easier to share code down the line.<p>

I think it would be great to have a suites.root, and that Frontier should come with an empty one that is in the system.paths table.  I expect others have different opinions....<p>

Ideas?
