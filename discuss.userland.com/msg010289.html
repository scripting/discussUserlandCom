having said that, it appears to me that the security issue was completely poor/careless design of passport and not any weakness in nt.<p>

the unfortunate thing about email is that it is difficult to exert your consumer right to switch services because there's so much equity built up in an email address. all the forwarding features don't seem to work quite right if you were to try to switch email services.
