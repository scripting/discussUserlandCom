The answer is relatively simple: The Open Source movement has no feedback loop to end-users, and no imperative to create one. <p>

The majority of Open Source software is still written for programmer-users: the systems are made with flexibility - not usability - in mind. Enough hooks and parameters are included that the user can create features that don't exist in the default configuration. This is a great idea and a powerful paradigm for a target audience with the skills, the time, and the incentive to make the necessary changes.
