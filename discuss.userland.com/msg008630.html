A full Mac OS 8.6 eats up 16Mb (at least), it leaves very little amount of memory left for other applications, not to say memory-hungry apps like NS or IE. Also, for $1,600, it's not a consumer product! I have to admit, $1,600 for a 300Mhz G3 machine is a bargain, but I would rather see more bundled memory.
