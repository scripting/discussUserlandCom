The cheap hardware question isn't stupid. Considering the savings and the power you can get from a Celeron based system, you really wonder if you can't make  a nice server with a custom built machine and buy a second one with what you saved...<p>

I was really impressed by what I could do with a cheap Celeron with Frontier... really the best power/price ratio out there. And if you multiply the number of machines, well you multiply the power !<p>
