The journalist I was talking with is a smart guy so I let him in on a subtle but poignant bit I had been saving for just such an occasion."<br><br>This is not a gorilla, it's a <a href="http://formenmedia.ign.com/media/news/image/hardcore/karatechimp.mpeg">chimp</a>, who knows how to defend himself.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.heromachine.com/heromachine.html">Hero Machine</a> is very cool.<br><br>Northern California native <a href="http://www.goldbug.com/BarryStuff/CaliforniaFlowers.html">wildflowers</a>.<br><br>OK, speaking of the kinder gentler gorilla, I'm still reading the history book I mentioned yesterday. It gotten more interesting. Problem for Microsoft is, they got caught. They own the browser. The Web is this fantastic medium. Still. The last five years or so are kind of a blur. The book is more a timeline than anything. A way to review what happened. Channels, ActiveX, Active Desktop. It brings it back in focus. Here we are stuck with this gorilla, owning this thing they don't understand, and it's incredibly precious and important. All they want to do is sell Windows. Why couldn't they leave the Web alone, and sell Windows. Or if they <i>had</i> to get involved, why couldn't they make software that's good for the Web. I know I know I can hear them say "Well our software is better than Netscape's right?" Yeah but your software isn't better than the Netscape competitors that never had a chance. <br><br>Speaking of Netscape, they're scum too. I want to see what the new My.Netscape looks like (see below) but I can't <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/heldHostageByNetscape.gif">because</a> I use MSIE 6.0. Have I ever told you about my idea for the Corporate Death Penalty? First, let me be clear that I'm against capital punishment for people, strongly so, but curiously I would have no problem with the death penalty for corporations that behave recklessly with resources that don't belong to them. For example, I would have put <a href="http://www.exxon.com/index_flash.html">Exxon</a> to death for the <a href="http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/photos/exxon/19.html">Valdez disaster</a> to set an example for other would be rapers of the environment. And I would put AOL to death for holding the Web hostage to whatever stupid games they're playing. I told this idea to Scoble, in jest, talking about Microsoft, and he said "Dave then you'd have two Microsofts." I said "Scoble you don't get it, after the death penalty, there would be zero Microsofts, not two."<br><br>Craig Burton tutorial: <a href="http://www.craigburton.com/2001/04/27">Radio Remote Access</a>.
