Are you going to put any provision for time-zone adjustments (maybe a popup menu). Of course I missed the Pacific time note, sent to myself messages to get to class later this morning, and got them instantly. Hawai'i doesn't use Daylight Savings time, and I can never remember if we're 2 or 3 hours behind Pacific any given time of the year :-)<p>

As Micah said, a recurring events reminder might be cool too, send the message every Thursday at 12 noon or something.<p>

Looking real nice, mahalo.<p>
