There will be four webloggers here today, and Jake's mom, and Tori's dog Jake (neither of whom have weblogs as far as I know).

Scroll to the end. Yes, the P in P2P is <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/09/thePInP2p">people</a>. Dan says "Exactly." Thanks Dan. Looks like I've added a theme to Silicon Valley cyberculture. I like that. ";->"<br><br><a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$1965">Stan Krute</a> explains Radio UserLand to a newbie. I'd add that Radio UserLand not just about music, and then of course, neither is radio just about music. There are talk shows and news, baseball and football, contests, phone-in shows, and commercials. "It's the community, dummy." (I'm the dummy btw.) When you add the Internet to something, the thing it adds is community.<br><br><a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/fastpathtomusic">The Fast Path to Music</a> page has been updated.<br><br><a href="http://cabinet.editthispage.com/">Cabinet</a> continues to impress. The best weblogs are ones that reach outside the weblog world and bring me different ideas and points of view. Cabinet has a beautiful style and is always a great read.<br><br>InfoWorld: <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/00/09/14/000914hnwap.xml">WAP Forum moves to XHTML/TCP</a>. "The group, which has more than 580 member companies and hosted about 700 delegates here, is also making progress toward enabling additional services on WAP devices, according to Scott Goldman, chief executive officer of the WAP Forum."<br><br>Makes sense. My Netscape, My UserLand, <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$3524">My Marijuana</a>.<br><br>A List Apart has a new <a href="http://alistapart.zeldman.com/">URL</a>. (There's a <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/glamorous7.html">story</a> of course.)<br><br>In the <a href="http://www.flickfilosopher.com/oscars/bestpix/gandhi.html">Oscar-winning movie Gandhi</a>, he's talking to a Hindu who's crazed because he's going to hell for sure because he killed another man in the religious riots that were sweeping India. The man's son was killed in the riots too. Gandhi says the man doesn't have to go to hell if he adopts an orphaned Muslim child and raises him as a Muslim. So I'm going to adopt that philosophy. When someone reams me on the Web, instead of pointing to them, I'm going to find something commendable on the Web and point to it instead.<br><br>"gandhi"<br><br>
