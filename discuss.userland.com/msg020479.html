<p>
ESR bases his arguments on specific observations about the way the software market works.  If your observations conflict with his, I'd be very interested in knowing how.  If you can point out how ESR's conclusions do not follow logically from his observations, I'd be very interested in seeing the flaws.
<p>
If your best response to ESR is an <i>ad hominem</i> attack, I would account that as praise for him.
