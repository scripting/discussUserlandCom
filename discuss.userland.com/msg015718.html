It's the first app I've seen do something like that in years.<p>

It seems obvious that NetEvents is, at some level, incompatible with MacOS9, but I still need to ask: Has anyone else experienced this?<p>

If so, will there ever be an upgrade to NetEvents? It's quite old now, but hey, it was working until recently!<p>
