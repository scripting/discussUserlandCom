In both Opera 3.5 (my
              preferred browser) and MSIE 3, the page is not displayed until everything has loaded. When connected via
              modem, this makes a lot of finger twiddling before I can see the new content.</i><p>

I'm on a modem connection in New Zealand.  Doing "refresh" (which reloads *everything*) on www.scripting.com in Navigator 4.05 Mac takes less than five seconds before the text and calendar are displayed.<p>

To me, this isn't bad enough to qualify as "a lot of finger twiddling", or at least not compared to the average web site.
