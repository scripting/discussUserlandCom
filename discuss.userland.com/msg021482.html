That would be good.  However, to test my understanding of what you mean by "didn't change the file formats", I must ask some questions since some folks accidentally use slippery meanings.  (The questions are about forward and backward compatibility, but I won't use those terms, since some folks are bound to make those ambiguous as well.)<p>

Call an older version of a product A, and a newer version B.  Can a document be both read and written, by both A and B, in an interleaved fashion without either A or B getting confused even slightly?<p>

Can B always read and write documents created by A?  Can A always read and write documents created by B?  Is it necessary to install new software or convert any files during any of these steps?
