But we are aware of the rising number of portals built around RSS and Scipting News, and we wanted to offer users of those portals a way of navigating to their favorite channel before adding it to their personalized page.<p>

We were thinking of providing outgoing links (like the 'Add Netscape Channel' buttons) to these portals in a loose (and free) affiliation arrangement.  But the portals didn't want to send their users off to xmlTree (like Amazon affiliates do have to send their visitors to Amazon) - they wanted this channel search functionality in their own branding.<p>

So we are offering this, in two flavours:<p>

We offer the directory listing in raw XML, <p>

e.g. <a href="http://www.xmltree.com/export/container.cfm?DDC=005&L=3">http://www.xmltree.com/export/container.cfm?DDC=005&L=3</a><p>

where you can optionally specify your own stylesheet (requires IE5),<p>

e.g. <a href="http://www.xmltree.com/export/container.cfm?DDC=005&L=3&stylesheet=http://www.xmltree.com/myUserland.xsl">http://www.xmltree.com/export/container.cfm?DDC=005&L=3&stylesheet=http://www.xmltree.com/myUserland.xsl</a><p>

or, we will provide XSL transformation services on our server and provide the directory in HTML<p>

e.g. <a href="http://www.takepart.com/container.cfm?DDC=005&L=3&Stylesheet=http://www.xmltree.com/myUserland.xsl">http://www.takepart.com/container.cfm?DDC=005&L=3&Stylesheet=http://www.xmltree.com/myUserland.xsl</a><p>

This service is pre-everything and these URLs might change - but please use them over the next few days.  The use of My.Userland styling is just indicative - no arrangement has been reached with Userland (but I am trying to excite Dave!).  At the moment only news and weblog channels are being displayed - not forum-based ones.  By default, all channels on or under the selected subdirectory are displayed.  <p>

All feedback is welcome!<p>
