Question: why would you (or anybody) get a PIII over a Celeron?  All benchmarks that I've seen, "real world" based or otherwise, seem to put the Celerons at only a fraction behind the PII and PIIIs at comparable processor speed.  However, since Celerons are <i>so</i> much cheaper, you can easily get a faster Celeron for much much less money.<p>

Case in point: I just ordered a SMP motherboard with dual Celeron 366 overclocked to 550.  That's TWO 550Mhz Celerons for $350.  One PIII 500 is more than that.<p>

So where is the gap in my understanding?  Does a PIII have something that makes it significantly better for servers?
