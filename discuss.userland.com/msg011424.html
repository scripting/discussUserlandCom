We finally got <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1388">Red Herring</a>! What a long trip, but it has a happy ending. <i>Thanks!</i><p>

Unfortunately today's the day we did major surgery on the back-end of <a href="http://my.userland.com/default">My.UserLand.Com</a>. Lots of old stuff that it thinks is new. I guess that's the price of progress! With any luck things will settle down in the next hour. Thanks for your patience.<p>

Developmentor: <a href="http://209.110.197.27/cdl_fun/">Experiment with CDL and SOAP Marshaling</a>. Not sure what this is, but it's written in Perl and has something to do with SOAP.<p>

<a href="http://209.110.197.27/uuidcdl/">More Mystery CDL Stuff</a>. I wonder if this is what my experiments look like to Scripting News readers? I'll figure out what these CDL things are, for sure, and then I'll explain them!<p>

<a href="http://www.xmltp.org/">XMLTP.Org</a> is "an online community effort to standardize the transport mechanism for XML data. By taking cues from the Linux and Apache community, XMLTP.org is in the process of developing a standard way to send, receive, and execute upon XML data." Thanks to Wes Felter for that link.<p>

<a href="http://hack-the-planet.felter.org/">Wes</a> found another reinvented wheel on <a  href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=99/09/22/1249248&cid=5">SlashDot</a>.

This is some of the things that we will be looking at within the next year or so." <i>Wow!</i> "qbullet.sidesmiley"<p>
