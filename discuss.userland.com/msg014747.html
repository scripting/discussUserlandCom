Dan Gillmor, who you dismissed as 'getting breathless over silly things', is a writer (this isn't a silly thing to him). Many of my ideas in this area do come from professional writers and journalism professors. In the old hot metal days, most writers had no control over the typography so they didn't learn to use it, and only those that could express themselves in pure prose rose to the top.<p>

You also miss Jakob and others' points: (1) Watch readers, not writers. (2) Learning how to improve on-screen readability in today's world is very important.<p>
