The speaker was William Mitchell, a proffessor at the MIT School of Architecture.<p>

He made the arguement that in years past a computer's processing time was precious. Today we waste it - computers are sitting doing nothing a large part of the time. He claimed bandwidth was next, and said that soon we'd waste away bandwidth as well.<p>

He then then went on how this would radically change architecture... blah blah blah....<p>

I sure hope he's right (about the bandwidth, and his thoughts on our future abodes)<p>

He wrote a book about, call "City of Bits", here's the link at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262631768/qid%3D920583521/002-2144518-4689069 ">Amazon</a>
