There are actually a number of options, but you have to look at the enterprise market and products for process design, process re-engineering, functional design, database design, engineering requirements, et al.<p>

As a timely coincidence, I am doing some consulting with a Telco in this area (aka Meeting Facilitation and Shared Understanding for Project Groups), and have a couple of questions about Frontier's ability to support some of the things we are doing.<p>

- How easy is it to create relations between items in the Frontier database on the fly?<p>

For example, if I have 3 outline topic headings and the discussion is going fast and furious, how do I make sure that a sub-topic that appears under each heading is unique in the database (i.e. a single instance)? Cloning on a per-item basis? <p>

The reason is that I don't want to end up with 3 different versions of the subtopic in each of the three headings, I want just one sub-topic and I want it to be *related* to each topic heading, not copied nor just labeled identically. I also do NOT want to have to normalize the database by hand in order to achieve this, and I certainely don't want to be hand-managing a bunch of links on the fly.<p>

- I know I can represent that data collected during the meeting using XML, so the back-end out of Frontier for post-processing is covered, but it would be good to have a graphical input facility to allow one to create NODES and LINKS. Can Frontier use COM/VB or something similar to hook up to a product like Visio and in doing so provide the underlying data model for the graphics being displayed in Visio?<p>

As an example of what I am talking about, download a 1MB 30-day eval of a product called QuestMap (<a href="http://www.softbicycle.com/QMdemo.html">http://www.softbicycle.com/QMdemo.html</a>), which has a very fluid and completely graphical interface for entering in info in real-time during facilitation, and even has an integrated methodology called IBIS to use as a guideline when using the software.<p>

It's also worth checking out www.gdss.com for additional general information on this topic, as I think they actually own QuestMap at this time.<p>

Hope this helps.<p>
