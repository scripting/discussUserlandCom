I can imagine a scenario where a dozen connections come into Frontier within a second, and I'd hope for responses within 1 second.<p>

Protocols... I'm not too sure what the complete list is, but I know it supports TCP/IP.  I can program in Java or Objective-C, so I have the full Java and YB class libraries at my disposal.<p>

On NT it might even be able to talk to it with COM... that would require Frontier be on the same box as the WO appserver... which I doubt would ever happen, except during development.<p>

We're doing different types of applications over the next few months... data management and reporting, registration, database drill-down.<p>

For testing, XML-RPC would be a good start... I can use the Java XML-RPC library.  I'll measure the performance and determine if I need anything lighter than that.<p>

I'll let you know how things go.<p>
