Should one pull this table into a new DG table (like one does for the htmInterfaces.logon table)?  If one is a member of DGa and DGb and each has a different cookie name in members.root, then what?  <p>

With all of this cofusion as preamble, why would a DG called with <p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://myServer/htmlInterfaces/myGroup/public">http://myServer/htmlInterfaces/myGroup/public</a>

resolve to<p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://myServer/htmlInterfaces/myGroup/public?http://myServer/htmlInterfaces/myGroup/public/people/prefs/">http://myServer/htmlInterfaces/myGroup/public?http://myServer/htmlInterfaces/myGroup/public/people/prefs/</a>
</blockquote><p>

Notice that I have pulled htmlInterfaces.people into myGroup and changed #urls to point to it.  I think I could write a new doc for multiple DGs, if I could understand this part -- maybe ;-)
