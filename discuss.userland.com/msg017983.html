I also was looking at the qbullets (man, I've seen that same site 4 years ago!)  Here's my request: if you have a site at weblogs.com or ETP, or whatever manila site, you get also a url that points to a site-owner-defined gif which has two states : updated, not updated.  You access this gif via something like:<p>

[img src="http://webapps.editthispage.com/images/updated?hours=24"]<p>

Then when that image is queried, it checks to see if that weblog has been updated in the past 24 hrs and if so, it shows the updated gif, otherwise the not-updated gif.<p>

My thought is that there could be some qbullet-style tiny image you could place next to a site you refer to "anywhere" you refer to it and know immediately if it's been updated.  There could be an additional restriction of height and width so that folks dont put huge gifs in their settings.
