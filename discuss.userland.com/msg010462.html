With LinuxToday, they have set things up so that they get more hits on the individual summary page for each link.<p>

I have also been thinking about extending RSS to include full story text, so that there would be a way of giving permission to push a whole story around the net. For some kinds of news, this is the way it wants to work. For example, if you're running a channel containing news of product updates. Such an <item> would contain a one-two sentence description of the enhancement. Or a press release channel, could contain the full text of each press release. The intention of the sender is that it be disseminated far and wide.<p>

So there's lots of different kinds of content, not just the kind that has ads on it.
