Or is he in your "good" camp? Forget all the verbiage about the Internet focusing on the "bad" side of patents etc etc etc. The argument here is about Bezos's use of patents, patents about which I haven't heard anyone come out and say "this is a valid patent". Patents which I think personally should never have been granted.<p>

Why is it my lot, as a party being hurt by an invalid patent, to pay for the mistakes of the "system"? This doesn't seem right.<p>

Here's an idea: if a patent is overturned in court then the USPTO should pay the legal costs and damages incurred by the party or parties that caused the overturn. Why aren't they liable? Isnt that the missing link that would prevent all those bad patents from ever being issued in the first place?<p>

Just a $0.02 dreamin'...
