That's a far cry from sexual harrasment, much less rape. Such comparisons should be deeply offensive to victims of actual rape and sexual violence." --<p>

This is incorrect. What has brought Clinton to this point was misuse of the powers of his office, his willingness to lie under oath, and his continued legalistic squirming in the face of public outcry.<p>

As for the harrasment, if Clinton were the president of any corporation the board would have long ago fired him. There would be no question, no protracted hearings etc. In the US, at this time, having sex with a subordinate, in the work place, is the riskiest, most foolish, immature behaviour.<p>

That Clinton was willing to risk the global goals and economy of the US, wag his finger at the American public, tarnish the Office of the President, lie to his cabinet and other supporters, destroy his place in history and more all for some sexual gratification is intolerable. And frighteningly arrogant.<p>

People go to war and lay down their lives with things like "Duty, Honor, Country", "Freedom, Liberty, Courage" and so many other slogan's on their lips.<p>

Oh yeah, he wouldn't (and didn't).<p>

He couldn't even keep his pants zipped.<p>
