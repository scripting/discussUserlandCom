My server is a PowerMac G3 300 MHz.
Frontier v6
Mac OS v8.1<p>

I've noticed these errors in the inetd log.  One person told me they couldn't connect to my server.  I can see evidence that others are able to connect so it's not that no one can connect.<p>

If there is something I can tweak on my end, please let me know.  I can attempt to get more details if needed.  Point me in the right direction and I'll dig! :-)<p>

Thanks for any pointers...<p>

Toodle-looooooo.....
