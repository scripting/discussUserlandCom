For very small things I just use the Netscape textbox, which, as everyone knows, is horrid. For longer things I use the web browser built into XEmacs, w3, and it's textbox is just another Emacs buffer. Very cool.<p>

But, yes, if Emacs had a good Web-DAV client, we at Monkeyfist would be working a lot harder to add a Web-DAV interface to our CMS to go along with the CGI interface that we have now. We've talked about, and I even wrote a preliminary design document for, a Scarab interface -- <a href="http://casbah.org/Scarab">Scarab</a> is Ken MacLeod's answer to SOAP and XML-RPC; last I checked Scarab does SOAP, XML-RPC, and Casbah.org's LDO as well -- but there's nothing driving us to implement it since we right now a small group of contributors.<p>

I'm curious: why do you ask?<p>
