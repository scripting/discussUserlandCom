Switzerland and Austria are two small countries which are both legal neutrals. In the event of a war, any large European army could probably roll right over them</I><p>

As a former resident of Switzerland, I'd give the the Swiss better odds than you might think. ;-)<p>

Even today, the Alps are impassable, particularly in winter. The only ways to travel in Switzerland are tunnels, soaring bridges and narrow roads which literally <I>cling</I> to the sides of the mountains. Three days and a few tons of plastique would be sufficient to render ground forces useless to invaders.<p>

The Swiss can move through those mountains, though--I've seen little old Swiss ladies walk straight up grades that would leave an American athlete winded. So any occupying force would be fighting a long, bitter war against people hiding in the mountains. The invaders would be nearly immobilized, and the Swiss would be free to move and ambush as they pleased.<p>

Plus, having known the Swiss, I'd hate to be on the wrong end of their righteous indignation. I know how they feel about litter, shoplifting and loud noises after 10pm, and an invasion would probably qualify as all three.<p>

Cheers,
Eric
