The Desktop Printer Manager and the ColorSync extensions are of file type 'appe' and run as background applications.<p>

I managed to create a glue table for these, but when I try to speak to the extensions, Frontier gives me the message that the extension "..is not running or is not IAC-aware". The same script works in Apple's Script Editor...anyone know what's up?<p>
