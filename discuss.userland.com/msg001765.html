I've been using it for nearly six months and it works great.<p>

IPNetRouter is made on top of Open Transport and so is flexible and gains from recent OT performance enhancements, unlike its competition (whose name I've just forgotten ... aaarrrrggghhhhh) which builds its own IP stack from the hardware up).<p>

The downside is that IPNetRouter has to hack around one limitation in Opn Transport and you ned to do a slightly counter-intuiive setup in the TCP/IP control panel.
