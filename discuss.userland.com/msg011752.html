cannot really say that your comments make sense when
one reads the post you were replying to.  what did I
miss?<p>

(in case I didn't miss anything, the answer is yes,
that's exactly how copyright works.  the copyright
holder has the sole right to display his/her work,
and you're not allowed to redistribute a slightly
modified version of it, unless you have permission.
read the law.  it's available on line.)
