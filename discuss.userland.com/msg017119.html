Question: Pike uses ftp or http push to get it's info out to the server? Or something like FrontPage's (ack, pthhpt!) "Publish" functionaltiy?<p>

If yes, even this approach won't solve the firewall issue for all of us. There are administrators that won't allow outbound ftp or http push (or telnet any direction) through their firewall.<p>

If no, it uses a form-type PUT in the background, then just ignore me.<p>

Question: Pike only talks to Manila servers, yes?<p>

Thought (while in the shower this morn): if so, does (or could) Manila have smpt capability added?  In addition to ftp or http, could Pike e-mail changes to the server?  Have Manila put a special email address into a meta tag that Pike could use for posting changes.  SMOP, right? ;-)<p>

I havn't finished my first coffee yet, so this may not be completely coherant, but I figured I'd add to the brainstorming.
