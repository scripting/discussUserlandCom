At the very top of a page(or close by), could you provide a link(anchor) to the main content?  When I read Manila-ish sites with a text based browser, I have to scroll through several pages of sidebar text before I get to the main content.  It would be nice if there were a non-visible link(1x1 pixel transparent gif link with ALT="Main Content") that would only be visible if people were either using a text based browser or a screen reader for the blind. <p>

Perhaps this could be a configurable option?  I wouldn't ask normally, but I can't configure this myself since I can't get "outside the box" as it were. :-)<p>

Thanks.
