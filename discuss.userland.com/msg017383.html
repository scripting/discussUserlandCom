Much of the existing web pages have aged well beyond the brown banana stage and need active pruning.  Will you be encouraging your content providers to use a content aging tag?<p>

The next step will be predictive and shared searching.  We each have a doppelg&auml;nger and a twin online with opposing or similar search desires.  The power of XML tagged data sources like yours and connective technologies like XML-RPC will enable true realtime searching.  Even better it may open up real possibilities in effective web content creation.  The next 18 months will see much of this a reality and improve the web for millions.<p>

Best,<p>
