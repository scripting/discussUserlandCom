Well.  You might need one.  The Government could run it and it would simply list the DNS providers.  If the DNS providers didn't play by the rules, the Feds would take 'em off the list.  End of DNS provider problem.  Of course there would need to be rules about how long the DNS provider has to correct problems and all that.<p>
