This is pretty easy when you remember that a page like this:<p>

<html>
<body>
<&#172;ome script F
</body></html><p>

is the same as
print("<html>")
print("<body>")
com.callScript(...)
print ("</body></html>")<p>

Regardless of what language you use.<p>

PS
Typing HTML into web form is beyond hard.  I gave up.  Either Brent is far more patient than I or is editing directly inside Frontier.<p>

The Frontier side of this system should pre-parse all the text so that it is properly represented as HTML at the other end.
