a consistent user GUI has been a factor since, well, 1984 and the
introduction of MacOS.  Tog has some really good intro material on
this subject in his books.  You gotta give the user a consistent
experience.  (And this may have been one reason why HyperCard didn't
take over the world; no consistent UI.)<p>

So... what about broadband?  The broadband MTTF is gorgeous, but the
UI Marc developed is, as far as I know, just something he came up 
with.  What's going to stop the next person writing a DHTML app from
coming up with something else that's just as good but isn't consistent
with what Marc's done?  Is this lack of consistent UI a fatal flaw?
