Sounds very, very interesting.<p>

There's also a <a href="http://www.osopinion.com/Opinions/EliotLandrum-ThomasCharron%20/Eliot-Thomas1.html">review</a><p>

There's also a pretty good <a href="http://www.durlacher.co.uk/research/resrepdetail21.asp">Durlatcher report</a> about community building and the future:<p>

"However, we believe that to successfully capitalise on community the next generation of internet sites will deliver innovative integrated tools that fuse commerce, content and community."
<ul>
	<li>eComm layers within topic of discussion 
	<li>peer reviews and testimonies in real time
	<li>chat about same part of the transaction process
	<li>chat about same product types
	<li>chat with sales support people
</ul><p>

I've been developing a proposal for a community structure and this just tops it. So I'll eagerly be awaiting the connection to Manila and Jabber.
