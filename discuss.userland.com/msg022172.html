Nice work.<br><br><a href="http://www.betanews.com/article.php3?sid=988895859">Beta News</a>: "Microsoft's upcoming Windows XP will be the first step taken toward integrating Web services directly into the OS, a move that has AOL struggling to respond."<br><br><a href="http://www.bonnieraitt.com/">A Bonnie Raitt</a> song, I've only heard it three times. It's not very famous, but what a song. It's called "I just can't let go" or something like that. A beautiful bluesy beat so perfect for Bonnie. Looked on Google and fired up Napster, no luck. The music industry can produce such wonderful product but the distribution system sucks. Uhhh, the song is actually by <a href="http://www.lonestarwebstation.com/lucinda.html">Lucinda Willams</a>. This probably explains why I couldn't find it. Thanks to Tom Maddox for the clue. There's a demo of the song linked into this <a href="http://personal.inet.fi/koti/ismo.grondahl/page3.html">page</a>. Yeah, it's the same song. The one I heard on the radio was a lot cleaner. <i>It's still sweet.</i><br><br><a href="http://zopefish.weblogs.com/2001/05/06">David Brown</a>: "Well, I've kind of gotten hooked on ActiveState's ActivePython distributions.

The discussions have since shifted toward Napster using Microsoft's security technology. What Microsoft would get out of the deal is being hashed out, but could involve licensing fees or an equity stake in Napster."<br><br><a href="http://discuss.outliners.com/msgReader$1059">Jack Thompson</a>: "I currently use Inspiration as my primary outliner for writing purposes."<br><br><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/06/LV172443.DTL">SF Chronicle</a>: "In our disposable, Pentium-powered culture where nobody's got time for anything, speed dating has become phenomenally successful."<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/05/technology/05DOTC.html?pagewanted=all">NY Times</a>: "My dad's definitely got a different outlook," said Jeff S. Merrick, 25, who was laid off April 12 and recently left on a monthlong vacation to Costa Rica, stretching a 10-day trip he had planned. "When I said I was extending the trip, his first words were: 'A month? Don't you have to look for a job?'

It's not true that all moms and dads are kind to their kids. If a child says, even in a not too obvious way, that there are problems at home, please check it out. <br><br></a>
