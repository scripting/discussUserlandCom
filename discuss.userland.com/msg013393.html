Go to the top level site, and see a redesign with the words "Thank you for your patience while we are working to resolve site speed issues."<p>

Any Guess what www.foodtv.com is running? <p>

Figure that companies with 250k solutions would work like the plague to avoid the notion that it has a slow server solution.<p>

I still have not gotten the listing for Iron Chef... oops, here it is, now with abbreviated show titles. <p>

Hate to say it, but somebodies server software needs to go on a diet. This speed makes it seem like two fat ladies cook low cal.
