Using IP addresses instead of fully qualified domain names shouldn't be a problem. Also, I think it's unlikely that cookies are to blame here.<p>

What browser are you using to access the server? What version?<p>

Is Frontier serving directly or is it running behind a web server?<p>

Assuming you have logging enabled, does the error message show up in the inetd sub-table of the daily log GDB? Do you get an entry for the request in the mainResponder sub-table of the daily log GDB?<p>

What does the error message you get look like exactly?<p>

Does the error occur regardless of which page you try to access? Or have you actually been able to bring up a mainResponder-served page in your browser?<p>

If you prefer you can contact me directly at <a href="mailto:andre@userland.com">andre@userland.com</a> and we can continue the troubleshooting session in German...
