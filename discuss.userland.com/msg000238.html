While I'd like to learn scripting with Frontier as a hobby, it is most valuable to me as an outliner.  <p>

I absolutely LOVE the outlining capabilities of Frontier.  It's easy to use and produces great looking outlines that I can post to the web.<p>

However, not being a developer (I'm a marketer), it's hard to justify the purchase of Frontier to my company (or to my own wallet <grin>).<p>

I think an outliner with a lower cost price point would be ideal.  I'd buy two licenses in a snap!<p>
