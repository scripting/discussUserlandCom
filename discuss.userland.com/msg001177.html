Oh man. I found a big performance bug in the server this morning. One of the logs, user.log.outlines.inetd had 24000  lines in it. I did a select-all, and a cut, and the server performance problems went poof!<p>

In the NT Task Manager graph, no more flatlining at 100 percent. The display is just chattering nonstop while requests come in. On the user side of the fence, I get instant responses to every click in the Discussion Group.<p>

My fingers are crossed. I think we have this one nailed. It won't do for me to just put a Post-It on my screen. I have it tatooed on my forehead. Next time I complain about server performance please say "Dave, did you check the outlines?"<p>

Ohhhhhhhhhhh.<p>
