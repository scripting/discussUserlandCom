You are <I>too</I> kind.  That may have been the idea, but a quick survey of 'legacy media' is enough to shoot that idea down.  I am not sure what advantage legacy canned memes have over the new kind, besides the aesthetic benefits of informed posturing vs. the uninformed kind.  In fact, uninformed posturing by the unwashed masses is rather refreshing, don't you think?  (TMPFC:  "spam, spam, spam, spam!")<p>

And of course the 'can' is different, too.  Nice and shiny.<p>

The killer app. of XML?  I think it is more fruitful to ask a DOM question.
