A quote from the second link:

 In particular we are going after the higher end
technical information publishers, the kind of users that have been using SGML and XML already and have been
implementing linking systems, IETMs, document repositories, electronic review, document workflow, textual databases,
intelligent graphics systems and so forth - without all the benefits of standard Web technology. So we will address the wide
area of an application infrastructure on top of standard browser technology. AND we are going to have plenty of demos to
show how applications can be constructed on that infrastructure.<p>
