<b>RDF</b> is <i>lab coat slang </i>for Artificial Intelligence.<p>

It's really strange...  why is it that something as beneficial as AI could be to the web <u>has</u> to be morphed into the mangle of details found on the w3c site?  <p>

To make sense to "dumb machines" - <i>machines that are only capable of doing what they are told to do by us in the first place </i>- we have to feed them instructions that we ourselves don't even really understand!<p>

I know I'm over-simplifying, but it's like there's this cook who has added too much of a good thing to the soup.  <i>Now it tastes bad, but he has a table full of hungry guests.  </i>He has no solution but to keep adding other *things* to try and salvage the doomed soup.  And it's hot in the kitchen...<p>

Yuck.
