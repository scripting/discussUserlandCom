Here's another system that polls users and asks them for ratings/reviews... PlanetClick. <a href="http://www.planetclick.com">http://www.planetclick.com</a><p>

Having a transparent system without having to install something on every client is interesting.<p>

I guess it's another on the list of rating systems... directories, search engines, Alexa, PlanetClick, my bookmarks.<p>

One reverse lookup of interesting sites is to go to HotBot or a search engine that lets you do a search on links from one site to another and place the URL of a site that you are following and you might get dropped at a good site or a listing of related sites.
