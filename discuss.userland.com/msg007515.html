If you make a new list somewhere in the ODB, say at scratchpad.mylist, and then programatically change the list with a line of usertalk as follows:<p>

<pre>
	scratchpad.mylist[1] = 10
	scratchpad.mylist[2] = 20
</pre><p>

then save the ODB, quit frontier, and open it back up, the list will be empty. If, however, you do the following:<p>

<pre>
	local (mylist = scratchpad.mylist)
	mylist[1] = 10
	mylist[2] = 20
	scratchpad.mylist = mylist
</pre><p>

save, quit, and open, the changes are there. It seems as though changing elements of a list that lives in the ODB (as opposed to the stack) don't get properly saved and are somehow considered temporary.<p>

It took me quite a while to figure this out, so I thought I might as well save some others from the same frustration :-).
