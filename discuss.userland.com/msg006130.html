There's probably nothing technically preventing users from picking their own music streams song-by-song, but the money flows from broadcasters/netcasters to BMI/ASCAP to the artists; this is how artists make money on airplay.  The reporting process is very tightly prescribed, and letting multiple users pick their own tunes, I suppose, would be exponentially more difficult to track.
