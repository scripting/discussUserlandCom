Didn't you hear the big news??! <p>

Netscape announced they're supporting CORBA in a big way! 
OMG declared Open Doc to be the official user interface toolkit of CORBA, and Netscape even announced that they're doing Open Doc in a big way, too! 
Even bigger than Apple's CyberDog and IBM's OS/2 put together! 
And then they're going to rewrite the browser in Java!!!<p>

Oops. Oh, never mind. 
I just had a Y2K bug, and though the calendar jumped back a few years. 
We now return you to your regularly scheduled program.<p>
