Information is available at <a href="http://www.be.com/products/freebeos/">http://www.be.com/products/freebeos/</a><p>

It looks like they have devised a way to make the BeOS live in the Windows filesystem, so you don't need to partition your drives or anything to try out the OS. I'm still not clear on whether this will work with my NTFS filesystem.<p>

Personally, I think this is really cool! I ran one of the early beta preview versions of Be on my Mac a long time ago, but I haven't seen any of the released versions.
