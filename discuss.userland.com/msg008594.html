I know I'm very much in the minority on this, but no, Dave, it ain't.<p>

Equity is debt.  Pure and simple.<p>

Which means you <i>give up</i> power when you go public.<p>

I suppose it can be argued that equity is one of the instances where giving up power leads to more... To which I can only point out that many a founder of a company has been canned by shareholders.  [shrug]<p>

My own inclination is to say a company should only be taken public when the survival of the company is at stake... But, as I say, I know this is a minority view.<p>

But Jean-Louis will never again control Be the way he once did.  Unless he buys it back.  (Which should be a hint:  if one is genuinely in control, where would the necessity for buying back be, if you see what I mean.)<p>
