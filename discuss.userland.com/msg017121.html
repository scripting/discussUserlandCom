We're studying it now.<br><br>	We believe there is a way to work around it using the Referer attribute of an HTTP request. If you want to be safe, and you have a Manila site, either log off the site, or don't visit any sites that might not be friendly. I know that's not very helpful. We'll post more advice here as we figure it out.<br><br>	Second line of defense, in your Manila site, in the Editors Only menu, click on Prefs, then Legal Tags. Make sure the <script> tag is turned off. This prevents someone from using your site to compromise your site.<br><br>	Another way to defend. Use Pike to edit your site. If your home page gets overwritten, you will have a copy of the content on your workstation. Make a minor change and Save. Maybe the (so far imaginary) hacker will give up in frustration.<br><br><b>To EditThisPage.Com editors</b><br><br>	<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$644">Bulletin</a>: "It's clear to me that people in the EditThisPage community would prefer if we continue to host the site, so that's what we'll do."<br><br><b>Honoring the <i>excellence</i> of EditThisPage.Com</b><br><br>	<a href="http://stackframe.weblogs.com/">StackFrame</a>: Serving up information, opinion and hot-links about hard-core software development.<br><br>	<a href="http://saenz.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$165">May snow</a> in Teller County, Colorado.<br><br>	<a href="http://whatdidyouhaveforlunch.weblogs.com/">What</a> did <i>you</i> have for lunch?<br><br>	<a href="http://dhtmlmenus.editthispage.com/">Pulldowns</a> for Manila.<br><br>	<a href="http://ballin.editthispage.com/">Basketball</a>.<br><br>	<a href="http://drinkboy.editthispage.com/">Drinks</a>.<br><br>	<a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Wes</a>.<br><br>	<a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$109">Joel</a>.<br><br><b>UserLand's third press release</b><br><br>	Press release: <a href="http://news.excite.com/news/pr/000509/ca-userland-software">UserLand Submits SOAP 1.1 to W3C</a>.<br><br>	Of course it <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000509/ca_userlan_1.html">made</a> it onto Yahoo too. <i>Where else?</i><br><br>	Oooh they're poppin up: <a href="http://www.marketwatch.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CorEnqbWbu0zuvteYn">CBS MarketWatch</a>, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/stocks/fullstory.asp?id=1793500">CNBC</a>.<br><br>	<a href="http://soap.weblogs.com/soapQuotes">Full quotes</a> from Tim Bray, Paul Everitt, Fredrik Lundh, Jakob Nielsen, Tod Nielsen, Tim O'Reilly, Doc Searls, Kevin Werbach and myself.<br><br>	Interesting, all the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/stocksDownOnSoapAnnounce.gif">stocks</a> listed in the press release are going down today.
