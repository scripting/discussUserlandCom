<ul>
<li>they assume that everybody <i>inside</i> the firewall is loyal, whereas in fact the most serious security disasters are due to disgruntled members of your own staff
<li>they assume that everybody <i>outside</i> the firewall is hostile, whereas in the modern world most of your partners and collaborators work in other companies
</ul><p>

And as Dave said, firewalls don't even protect against many types of viruses and worms.
