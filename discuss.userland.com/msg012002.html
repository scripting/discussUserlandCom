We made a significant backend change yesterday -- we dumped our old proprietary backend architecture and moved to Vignette's Storyserver. After a couple of false starts, we feel pretty confident about the new system -- except for a couple of details here and there. And our RSS file (or, more accurately, the way our redirect server chokes on the commas in the new URLs) is one of those details...<p>

We're working on it now. I'll report back just as soon as everything is working again.<p>
