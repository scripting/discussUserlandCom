Can anyone create a Java applet that would be a replacement for the browser's built-in text editor? The assumption is that even a vanilla Java editor window is better than the browser's editor.<p>

Here's what the applet has to do:<p>

1) Present a text editing area -- but embedded in the page, not opening up in a new window.<p>

2) Get the text to edit via an XML-RPC call to a server (could be a server other than the one serving the console page, if possible).<p>

3) Provide a submit button that, when clicked, causes the browser to post the text to a specified URL. (This button doesn't have to be part of the applet, as long as when it's clicked the browser submits the edited text to a specified URL, as with a standard form.)<p>

4) Be cross-browser and cross-platform.<p>

In addition, it would be great, but not required, if the applet had a menu bar directly above the edit area. This menubar would be much like Frontier's HTML menu, a menu of HTML editing commands.
