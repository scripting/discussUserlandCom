The agent script must be selected in the about window popup. When you use thread.callScript to display a message, the msg verb is called from a different thread that is not an agent, so the message will show up.<p>

<i>What are the conditions under which an agent may fail?</i><p>

An agent should only stop running if it throws a scripterror. However, there was at least one kernel bug affecting the reliability of agents. Frontier 6.2 will be much more stable in this regard.
