Doesn't this strike you as an odd thing to do to support a writing tool?  <p>

A better solution is to make Pike use a Two-way protocol, rather than 2 one-way ones.  Then, Pike can attach to a server, and they can talk back and forth on that connection.  Many other programs do this, telnet, ftp, quake, etc.  <p>

If I make a car that can't fit down normal city streets, I don't tell my customers to call the highway department and complain.  Firewalls are a fact of internet life and an important part of ANY network security measure. NAT is a fact of internet life as well.
