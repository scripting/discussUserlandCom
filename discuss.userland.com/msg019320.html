Exactly.<p>

I took a look at the <a href="http://users.belgacom.net/gc247244/analysis.htm">this analysis of the encoders</a> you referred to. I see that N2MP3 only appears in one sweep test, in which is is rated the same as lame.<p>

I haven't done any objective, repeatable tests, but subjectively, I've been very pleased with N2MP3 for pop/soft-rock, folk, and Scottish dance music.<p>

Now if I could just find (or maybe write) a matched-filter deconvolver to remove clicks and pops! I've tried several apps, but they all affect the desired signal far too much.<p>
