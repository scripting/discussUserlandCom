This thought just popped into my head as I was reading the following paragraph in an article in Slate:<p>

>>The video poker industry finessed itself into existence. South
Carolina law clearly banned gambling. But in 1986, as a favor to a
big local businessman, a state senator stuck a tiny amendment in
the back of a gigantic budget bill. The amendment erased two
words--"or property"--from an obscure South Carolina law. It passed
without any debate--public or private--and without legislators
knowing what they had done. It legalized video gambling, allowing
game owners to pay jackpots to video poker winners. It wasn't until
1989 that the state even realized what had happened.>><p>

I'm just thinking off the top of my head. If the draft legislation were constructed and maintained as structured text, you could track all kinds of things, especially pertaining to change history, and authorship. It might be easier to notice seemingly trifling changes made secretively in the dark of night. I really haven't thought much about this one, it just sort of came to me.
