<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm going to disagree with you on this one.<p>

Why?<p>

Because Linux is just a UNIX clone, plus the hype of
4 million rabid anti-Microsoft bigots.  Apple doesn't
need the hype, and all that is left after that is a
UNIX clone.  At that point, what is the benefit of
going with Linux?  Consider:<p>

<OL>
<LI>Darwin has a real device driver interface.  Linus
doesn't believe in device driver interfaces.  On the
PC, with millions of users "able" to create device
drivers, the hardware support situation is abominable
anyway.  On the Mac it would be nonexistant - only
Apple would make peripherals.</LI><p>

<LI>Darwin is the product of 30 years of evolution and
understanding of what does and does not work in operating
systems.  Linux is a hobbyist hack that got popular.
Darwin is very close in code to some of the more secure
UNIX clones out there (the free BSD variants such as
OpenBSD).  Linux is known for being easy to break into.</LI><p>

<LI> Linux *specific* apps also tend to be i86 specific.
Apple doesn't get access to these by going with Linux
on PPC.  On the other hand, OpenBSD can already run
Linux binaries on the same platforms.  Darwin's
abstracted technical foundation (Mach 3, message
passing v. everything in-kernel) make developing
this sort of capability a lot easier.</LI><p>

<LI>Most of the software that makes up a typical Linux
distribution was available before Linux, and much of
is already in Darwin anyway (all the UNIX tools, the
GNU software, etc).</LI><p>

<LI>Linux apps are UNIX apps.  UNIX is a technical OS.
Linux is a technical OS.  The point of Mac OS X is to
use a good subsystem (Mach) as the underpinnings of a
modern graphical OS, not to force UNIX down the throats
of non-technical users.</LI><p>

<LI>The Linux development community tends to be extremely
immature, both in terms of personality and in terms of
understanding quality and the state of the art.  Apple
doesn't need this in their public relations or their
codebase.  I certainly don't need it in my codebase.</LI>
</OL><p>

With all due respect to the fantastic accomplishment
that Linux represents (both in terms of creating a new
operating system "from scratch" and in terms of creating
something significant and usable in Open Source), it's
not ready to be my client OS or my server OS for serious
work, and the Linux community needs to realize that the
leap required is more than a code fix.<p>

One of the reasons I'm excited about Mac OS X
is that Apple *didn't* choose to go with Linux.<p>
