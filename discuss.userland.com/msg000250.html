They have the big advantage of being simple, but for big sites, and even more for multisite referencing, I belive that we have to move on to something more robust, like rdf.<p>

So in my dreams, the next step for the Frontier search engine is to look for rdf-entries in the documents and make special indexes of them.<p>

This would make it possible to, when you make a new document building on or refering to an old, make a (rdf-formatted) reference to the old one. And the search enginge could present not just a hit-list, but also the relations between documents.<p>

P.S. There is proposals for replacing the URL-locators with URI-identifiers. I belive this also contains some document versions features. Maybe it has some relevance to your proposal.
