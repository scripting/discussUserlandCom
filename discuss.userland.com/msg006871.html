I can recommend www.jya.com/crypto.htm, it's a very active weblog.<p>

One question: jya has been visited daily almost since it started by a bot from the NSA (IP number 144.51); Dave, have you seen anyone from 144.51 on scripting.com? I wonder if they archive all of the web, or just some interesting weblogs?<p>

See <a href="http://jya.com/nsa-bot.htm">http://jya.com/nsa-bot.htm</a> for more info (and a whois search on 144.51).<p>
