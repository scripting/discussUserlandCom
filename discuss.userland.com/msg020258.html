I can see a developer who creates closed/proprietary extensions to TrulyFree licensed products doing the same thing.  But again, it's a measure of how much they contribute to OS/TF software that determines whether or not they are really "part" of the OS/TF community or just making money off of it.<p><p>

An excellent counter example is the vast number of developers who have used TrulyFree software, redistributed the enhanced-TF software, and contributed almost nothing, if anything at all, back to the community.
