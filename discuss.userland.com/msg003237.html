I know this can't be pinned down, "when it's ready, it'll ship" i'm sure is the stock answer...I just wanting to know if it's in the 2-3 month range, or farther off.<p>

I've been busy on other projects and was hoping to swoop up the nirvana learning curve once the docs were ready...but I have a project that I know will benefit from Nirvana's features and I'm wondering if I should dive in now or try to push this project into the future a bit...<p>

Is the end-game in sight?
