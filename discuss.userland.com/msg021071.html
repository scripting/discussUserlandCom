This is the polite way to handle these situations. Ask the author to fix the broken license. (I'm only aware of three developers who have <i>ever</i> said no.)<p>

<i>But why was such a conversation necessary in the first place?</i><p>

Because people insist on using the GPL for libraries, which is bogus. In my opinion, libraries shouldn't be pushy about application licenses. (And I've publicly criticized Stallman for suggesting otherwise.)<p>

Applications, though, are different from libraries. Would it be right to create a proprietary version of the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation Program</a> without the authors' permission?<p>
