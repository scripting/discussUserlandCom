<i>Here's a surprisingly <a href="http://www.dana.org/brainweek/">brain-dead site</a>. It's sole purpose, as I understand it, is to promote an annual event called "Brain Awareness Week". Now I know it's in March, but when in March?? Hello. It should be at the top of every page.</i><p>
There's a graphic in the top frame of every screen that shows "Brain Awareness Week" runs March 13-19. <p>
For those of you planning ahead, they also add (on their homepage): "Upcoming Brain Awareness Week Dates: March 12-18, 2001; March 11-17, 2002"<p>
I <i>like</i> their slogan about the brain: "Just use it." Tee hee.</p></p></p>
