Yes, you will be learning all about the back-end. ";->"<p>

Notice that the outline is in my member record. Any UserLand.Com member can create as many surveys as they want. I just have to finalize the XML format, and create a user interface that allows you to add a new survey by pasting in the XML text.<p>

And we'll release the source for surveys.root. It's a little obnoxious right now, I want to do some cleanup and add a few more features before committing.
