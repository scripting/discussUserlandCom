Rendering that to HTML via the website framework is no big deal. However, I also want to be able to serve a PDF file containing the same content, formatted according to some kind of "PDF template" that I control. Is this possible? Does anyone have any ideas about good ways to proceed?<p>

Thanks...<p>
