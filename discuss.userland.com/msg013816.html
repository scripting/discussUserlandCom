We added a "Cache-control:no-store" http header, which should have kept us out of their cache.<p>

What was weird was that it broke video playback (realserver) on our site- we would send down a RAM file, which is basically a pointer to the actual media we wanted to play. IE was deleting these pointer files before handing them off to realplayer... <p>

This suggests it may be the answer to your problem with IE. YOu may be able to do the same thing with an HTML META HTTP-Equiv tag- your mileage may vary.<p>

Hope this helps,<p>
