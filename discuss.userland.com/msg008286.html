I'm actually working with console.root, but whenever I try the preview, I get macro errors from the rpc calls to betty with mainresponder.new.getpreview. <p>

The error says "The server, localhost, returned error code 7: Can't find a sub-table named "Lukas:Applications:Scripting:Frontier 6.0fc1:Guest Databases:apps:mainResponder.root".<p>

Lukas, the drive, no longer exists. I can't find this path <i>anywhere</i> in frontier.root, and I can't figure out how to debug <b>betty.rpc.server</b> - it get's called outside the debug context when debugging the client. I want to step into the server so I can find where it's getting this path.<p>

Can anyone help me?<p>

UPDATE: user.betty.rpchandlers was the culprit. There were a couple bad paths in there. I still am wondering how I could step through betty.rpc.server if I needed to.
