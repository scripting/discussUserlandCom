I asked him of all the parterships that his companies announced, how many had any substance at all.<p>

He said 1 in 3. So figure it out, 2/3 of the articles you read on News.Com have absolutely no substance at all.<p>

I also believe I understand how the PR process works. I played the game pretty well, had articles written about me in every major pub, Fortune, New York Times, Business Week, all kinds of international publications. I even wrote for one of them for a couple of years, and got to see the workings on the other side of the line. For a year, Pointcast had a quote of mine in 100000 point font on their tradeshow booth. <p>

I've also sat in press conferences as obvious questions remained unasked, and sometimes they were asked, yet <i>none</i> of the pubs present reported on the questions that were raised. I saw one high tech CEO put up a set of meaningless numbers and have them be cited in the New York Times the next day.<p>

I also saw the Times stay silent as the CDA unconstitutionally attacked free speech on the Internet. <p>

So I'm not asking naive questions, I'm asking News.Com to explain how they work. I'll keep doing that. It's definitional. Either they start reporting news with substance, or I intend to help you and others route around them.<p>

This subject is also being discussed on the Syndication mail list. And in various off-line conversations. I belive the route-around is moving to the next level now, and I'm excited!!
