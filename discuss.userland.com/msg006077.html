I'm writing today to ask for some help with a project we're doing to embed Microsoft's HTML display control in Frontier 6. <p>

We have what we believe is an ease-of-use breakthru in management of news-oriented websites, and if we get this working the result will be better than on any other OS because of the integration of the HTML in the OS.<p>

The problem is that we're wanting to embed this in an app that's not written in C++. The expertise we need to tap into is someone who knows how to work with non C++ apps and ActiveX components. We have a DLL that implements our bridge. <p>

The engineer working on this is Brent Simmons. Brent is based in Seattle, so he could work closely with the right person at Microsoft.<p>

I'm hoping you can help us find the right person.<p>

For an explanation of the problem, see this <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5860">message</a>.<p>
