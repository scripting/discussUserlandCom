Right after a new release I like to ask <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$4756">How Are We Doing</a>?<p>

A note about docs. For this release they're more complete than for any previous release. However, there are still holes that must be filled. Brent and Andre will work with users over the next few weeks to add HowTos to the documentation site. Please ask questions on the mail lists or the DG, and they'll get answers on the website asap. We have a good CMS, and the guys know the product, so it's just a matter of (a small amount of) time before the gaps are filled. As always, <I>Still diggin!</i><p>
