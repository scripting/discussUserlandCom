It's also a good enabling technology and I think it is getting folks ready for something else: SVG.<p>

SVG is to Flash what HTML is to Microsoft's Blackbird language.<p>

SVG is an xml syntax for describing vector graphics.  Which means it's both text and graphic.  So you can search SVG files, zoom them, etc.
And they have a DOM so you can script them using javascript or VBscript.<p>

Flash is great, but SVG is going to really make waves.<p>

And I've seen implementations of SVG from several companies - it's as good as flash in many ways.  Plus, imagine if your UI was created using SVG as well - imagine the clean fast downloads and great interactivity.<p>


Given that manila talks xml already, I really think it will be a no-brainer for it to support SVG. <p>

Also, SVG supports forms - like Flash recently started supporting - so you can have form widgets using SVG like pulldowns, etc.  And it's all CSS styleable, so your UI can have the same look and feel as your page.<p>

Plus SVG is and open standard - supported by IBM, Adobe, Macromedia, etc. etc.<p>
