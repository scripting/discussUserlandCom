Got it. Got to think with less 'tight corners'.</i><p>

Yes yes. The tight corners are gone in Frontier 6. The website framework is now fully dynamic. With that, and guest databases, we were able to add a lot of new features, they all appear in your pagetable, just some new features.<p>

Also, when you're ready, learn about Server Attributes, which are the flipside of rendering attributes that you already use. There's another level of amplification there.<p>

This time we waited until the software was reasonably mature before rolling it out. We offered it to adventurous developers early on, so people like Jim Roepcke, Seth Dillingham and Matt Daw are already up the curve. <p>

Now it's going to get broader, Brent and Andre, UserLand people, are working on the next steps, and I'm getting to look at future stuff again, and at the same time figure out what needs to be explained in what order for new people. Pretty cool system we have here.
