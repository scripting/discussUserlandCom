I doubt it. The reason Apple is delaying the release of Mac OS X, purely based on tea-leave reading, is that it is not ready for users yet. The March release will certainly slip. Steve will say "There's no real reason to ship it to stores, people can download it over the Internet." And the July date will slip. It would be suicidal for Apple to put OS X in real users faces before it's exactly a clone of Mac OS 9, with a few minor improvements that aren't in your way. Unless they're stupid or very fast (it'll never happen) Mac OS X can not be pre-installed on anything other than servers for another couple of years. Software takes time. You can't hurry love. Look at the features they're bringing online now. Core stuff. (Until a couple of weeks ago the Apple logo was in the middle of the screen for crying out loud.) It might be a management technique. Keep the engineering team in 24-by-7 death-march mode. But that's probably already been going on for a couple of years. That was how Copland died, btw. Remember Copland?<br><br>What if Apple had done the deal with Be instead? Oy. They made the wrong friggin choice.

Bring on the rolling blackouts. I've been turning things off. Last night I turned off the VCR with the blinking clock. Since my cable TV is off, I don't think I'm going to be recording any shows.
