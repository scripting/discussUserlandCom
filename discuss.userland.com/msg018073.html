The plane leaves in less than 24 hours and the emails and phone calls I'm getting are amazing. I think I must stay closer to the backbone, and within a 2 hour plane trip to Seattle. I'll be reporting on some of the developments in real-time, but I'd say SOAP has gained traction now and is starting to boom. I've been trying to balance this against my desire to swim in the Atlantic and eat disgustingly greasy NY Jewish food. My thought is that I can go to NY in August, but right now the stuff I've wanted to happen is happening now, and it's here on the west coast, not in the east.
