As I go back to re-read this stuff I realize that the original content has been changed since I first read it.  In many ways this is a nice feature, but for those trying to follow a thread it may change their understanding of what it is all about.<p>

Perhaps you should allow the author to indicate whether he/she wishes to indicate that a change has been made or maybe retain a link to the original version, kind of like a version history for the comment. This capability may be a little overkill for a discussion forum but would be nice if it could be done easily.
