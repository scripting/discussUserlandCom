Thats news to me, here I am working in Java everyday, it seems pretty real to me.  I make a multimedia authoring system written in Java.  I choose Java because I think it's a better language, and because of the very real portability I gained from it.<p>

Right now I have more than 125+ CBT courses built with my system running in 200+ locations:
