"Nearly 13 years ago, investors stunned by the worst stock market week in memory spent the weekend pondering whether a great bull market was over. On the following Monday, so many of them decided to sell that the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 22.6 percent, or 508 points. Oct. 19, 1987, became known as Black Monday."<br><br>AP: <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20000416/bs/world_markets_4.html">Asian Markets Open Sharply Lower</a>.

There is an initial limit of one megabyte of gems per UserLand-hosted site. We want to get a feel for how this works. There aren't a lot of places on the net where you can get free hosting of arbitrary file types served through HTTP, for good reason. It costs money to store and serve the objects, and there's no obvious way to monetize the service, if it's free. There may be an opportunity for a for-pay service that hosts arbitrary file types in Manila. We're releasing the software to all Frontier customers, that's the most important thing, esp for private internal sites where this is not a big issue.<br><br>BTW, our use of the term "gems" dates back to 1995. It was one of the menus in <a href="http://www.scripting.com/clay/">Clay Basket</a>. It's also a repository of patent prior art.<br><br>Jakob Nielsen: <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000416.html">Reset and Cancel Buttons</a>.

If you go there, you'll come away believing that Oracle is great, that Larry Ellison is god, that no one actually uses Windows, and Davos is a circle-jerk, no one cares about fonts and that undergrads can implement an object database in a relational DB as a first semester project. <i>But your education *will* be free.</i><br><br>I learned all these things in a public discussion at the Seybold/Boston show in February. (I didn't pay for the education.) After Greenspun said it was silly to use fonts in web pages I asked for a show of hands. How many people care about fonts? Every hand went up. Of course if you learn how to develop web apps from Greenspun, you might have trouble selling your services to the kinds of people who go to Seybold. (People who develop websites, mostly.)<br><br><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$210">Greenspun</a> drinking coffee. <br><br>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000416mag-foundation.html">Bill Gates's Money</a>.
