We must help Napster get their Mac version working. Think of all the musicians that use Macs. They don't know how cool it is."<p>

Macster's problem is well noted and AFAIK only affects the preview release (which is what the company uses as a download). After experiencing the same issues Woz did I went and downloaded Rapster. I tried downloading one song with it but was unsucessful (the connection on the other end was 56K).<p>

Thats my only experience with Napster clones. I don't listen to MP3s, having only wanted to see what all the fuss was about last night.
