<i>Linux.Com survey on scripting languages. </i><p>

According to one of the comments, PHP now has a standard database API. Kudos to the PHP developers--all those inconsistent database interfaces in earlier releases made PHP unnecessarily cumbersome. It's still easier to do database work in Zope, but at least PHP is on the right planet.<p>

I've also been playing with another server-side scripting system recently: Apache and mod_perl. It turns out that Apache is highly modular and provides many extension hooks. Using mod_perl, I can access these hooks from Perl scripts. (As usual, there's an O'Reilly book: <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wrapmod/">Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C</a>.)<p>

Some benefits: Apache is really flexible. I can build smart proxy servers, database interfaces, content generators and custom authentication methods. If I'm careful, the resulting code will run under Linux/Unix and Windows NT. Some drawbacks: This only works if you control the Apache server in question, and you need to have mod_perl installed.<p>

At least one popular site uses Apache, mod_perl and MySQL to build a complicated content app: <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot.org</a>. So this combination can clearly scale.<p>

Dave would argue, though, that these back-end systems are becoming less interesting. There's only a certain number of people who want to hack around in the guts of their servers, and a lot more who simply want to develop content.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
