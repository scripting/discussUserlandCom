But I stand by my comment.  <p>

In your mail to me, you said: 
<blockquote>
"You respond as if when I'm talking about "open source leaders" I'm always talking about you. Sometimes I am, and other times not. You're not the only one Tim. An important thing to appreciate. Unless I clearly say I'm talking about you, it's not reasonable to respond as if I were. Thanks for considering this alternate point of view."
</blockquote>
A flame that's directed at a group of people is still a flame.  In fact, in some ways, it's worse, since it's a flame hiding behind the facade of generality.  No one can respond, because it can always be disclaimed--"I wasn't talking about you."  In other contexts, this argument can be used to cover racism and prejudice of all kinds.  It's at the root of attack politics and smear campaigns.  <p>

I'm not a big fan of political correctness or shilly-shallying around when there's something to say.  But inflammatory generalities are just that.<p>

I don't want to continue this discussion; I like the information in scripting news and davenet, so I won't unsubscribe, but I will just ignore your off-color comments from now on, unless they are directed specifically at me or at situations I know something about, in which case I will respond with specifics.<p>

If you want to keep flaming, but hide behind generalities, you can do so, but you won't get me to bless it as anything but a flame.<p>

BTW, this isn't about you or your personality.  It's about rules of politeness in internet forums.
