Let me focus. OK. <p>

I want to be friends with Brian.<p>

I want our communities to help each other.<p>

Yes, I want to see open source software at both ends of the pipe. On the server and on the workstation. I also want to see commercial software at both ends of the pipe. And I want it on Mac and Windows and Unix. <p>

I want to create a cloud of compatible software that lifts the web to the next level.<p>

I will put some commercial software into that cloud and some open source software. What's the mix? TBD. I will not be the only one, or else the whole idea is a failure. I have to have lots of competition for it to work.<p>

Apache should not try to meet the needs of writers, designers, graphics people. <p>

I'm asking for a public relations milestone, like the opening of embassies in each others' capitals. <p>

There's still a lot of crap floating around from the blustery days. I saw it myself on a Knight-Ridder website the other day, but that masks the real issue, opportunity is here. Microsoft is going to sweep this one. If I let everyone lecture me on how stupid I am, then I let them miss the friggin opportunity to get our respective acts togeher and upgrade people who use our servers and editing tools.<p>

There you go, that about summarizes my POV as of 9:17AM Pacific today.
