Now that a light bulb is shining brightly above me on this one, I have an envisioned idea.<p>

First step: a basic Frontier proxy server, simply sits on port X (probably 80, since that way, it would be firewall-friendly) and acts like a proxy.<p>

Second step: callbacks in the proxy server to allow:
<ul>
<li>authentication (by username, IP address, cookie, etc.)</li>
<li>modification of the stream sent back to the client (to add the bookmark functionality, for instance)</li>
<li>preprocessing of the outgoing data stream (to do something with the data, like add every URL visited to a history, or to do Paul's transfer of credit card purchases into Quicken, for instance)</li>
<li>caching</li>
<li>anything else anyone thinks of!</li>
</ul><p>

Third step: bask in the glory of an awesome community project.<p>

How does this sound?</p></p></p></p>
