Monday through Thursday are spoken for. Monday is a travel day, and Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are the Rising Tide conference.<p>

Then comes the July 4 weekend. I could do a dinner in NY on Friday, but I am concerned that most people will be gone. I remember summer weekends in NY, the city gets pretty empty. <p>

So my thinking is that I'll rent a car in Tarrytown, and tour around NY and the Berkshires, and find a beach somewhere, maybe New Jersey, and swim, read and hike, and then resume the business part of the trip in the middle of the following week.<p>

That would get me into NYC on Wednesday, July 5. I'd probably spend one or two nights in NY, then go to Boston for one day/night, then leave it fairly open with the possibility of going to Philadelphia and/or Washington. There are people I want to meet with in all these places.<p>

It's confusing and problematic because of the very long holiday weekend right in the middle.
