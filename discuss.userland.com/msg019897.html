This is an excellent point, of course; many people take an active interest in, and make an active contribution to, the foundation of encoding semantics.<p>

<i>I do not and have not claimed credit for RDF. Some of the ideas in MCF provided input into RDF. Even the MCF ideas were simply concepts borrowed from Knowledge Representation.</i><p>

The evolution seems clear to me, and for good reasons or ill, you seem to be the most visible person associated with that evolution. I have to say that I'm curious, given the background in Knowledge Representation, why there's no commitment to inferencing connected with RDF?<p>

Having asked that, perhaps impertinently given your apparent desire to dillute what you seem to perceive as an overidentification of RDF with R.V.Guha :-), let me just say that I appreciate whatever your contribution to RDF may have been, and your efforts on MCF and Cyc as well.
