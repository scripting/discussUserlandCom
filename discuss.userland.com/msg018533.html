It's very hard for a newbie (me!) to figure out which of the sites in the Userland box do what and where to discuss which pieces of the enterprise.  I'm <b>still</b> trying to figure out where to ask questions about the <b>htmlFavorites.js</b> script, for example, not to mention which <b>prefs</b> page does what.  Do I list the  weblogs I don't want to see on the <a href="http://www.userland.com/updates">http://www.userland.com/updates</a> page on my prefs for weblogs.com or userland.com?  Why does <a href="http://www.scripting.com/discuss">http://www.scripting.com/discuss</a> give me a 404 instead of the discussion group for Scripting News?  Where's the documentation for Frontier?  Who's "Dr. Matt" and is his stuff official and current?  <p>

I'm starting to worry about this for my internal Manila project; I can't point people at the Userland sites for help if I can't figure out which ones are appropriate myself.  <p>

So I think part of the problem is providing a Baedecker for the mass of stuff you've already got on the Web so that people can find what they want instead of hitting dead-ends.  Marginal notes are most useful for the owner of a book, not someone who picks it up later.  Just ask <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/">Andrew Wiles</a>!
