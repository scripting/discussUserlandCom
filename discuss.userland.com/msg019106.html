Xaudio is cross platform (Windows, Mac, various unix) and they distribute a SDK with a free licence even for commercial use. <p>

They claim to be "the fastest commercial MP3 decoding library in the world, up to twice or three times faster than some other implementations", which I haven't been able to test yet, but the API seems excellent on first look.
