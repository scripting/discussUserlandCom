The applications can range from personal email, to mailing list archives, to XML-RPC interaction. This is simply one more way to get information in and out of a Frontier ODB."<p>

I spent much of today developing a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/gifs/controlPanel1.gif">new control panel</a> for editing the Scripting News home page. As it develops I'll show you the screen shots. I'm really excited about this, now that a pattern has developed the thing is practically designing itself. <p>

<a href="http://www.humansource.com/">humansource.com</a> looks a lot like Jakob Nielsen's <a href="http://www.useit.com/">useit.com</a>. Cameron Barrett spotted the similarity, and <a href="http://www.camworld.com/ripoffs/useit/nielsen.txt">Nielsen</a> responded.<p>

I have a script that opens a web page in my browser, how can I force it to refresh the page from the server? It must work on Mac and Windows and in all popular web browsers. <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$2917">Answer</a>.<p>

I'm looking for a website that shows how various congressmen voted on the Communication Decency Act. Specifically, I'm interested in knowing how <a href="http://legislators.com/cgi-bin/member.pl?dir=rollcall&_member=il06&state=X">Henry Hyde</a> voted on it.<p>

This is actually a very hard question to answer. The CDA was embedded in the Telecommunications Reform Act, which did a lot of other things. Hyde voted Aye to the TCR act. If we want to get to the bottom of this, we're going to have to dig a little deeper. Hyde may have made a mistake. He taught us how impeachment works. We may now be able to turn the gun on him, and the rest of Congress and the President. Who's going to blink first? The net is much more powerful now and it's only getting more powerful.<p>
