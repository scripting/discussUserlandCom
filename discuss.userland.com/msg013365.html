The introduction reads:<p>

Many organizations use a mix of scripting languages as well as traditional language choices for a wide variety of projects. Other companies prefer to exclusively leverage scripting languages for all projects due to a scripting language's ease of use, power, and flexibility.<p>

Among other things, scripting languages are ideal for automating repetitive tasks and for quickly building server-side processes that can handle a wide variety of application needs. But are there instances when a scripting language is not the right choice? Are there certain application requirements that can best be fulfilled with traditional languages?
