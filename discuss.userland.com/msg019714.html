such a big deal, nor did their term seem unduly long.  Now,
obviously, things have changed.  (Especially since the scope
of what the USPTO says can be patented has widened considerably.)<p>

But take your pick -- do you want it to be fast, or slow?  The
faster it is, the sooner the public gets to see the ideas.
I'm not sure where it is between suggestion and implementation,
but I understand that there will be disclosure of US patent
applications, 18 (?) months after they're submitted, as there
are now for European and Japanese patents.<p>

In my experience, it seems to give the lawyers a head start in
wrangling, but in at least one instance, it did provide the
means to obviate a rather large-scale dispute by prompting
early negotiation with the applicant.<p>

<i>There have been (claims of) cases apparently of companies
working on open standards bodies, patenting the work of the working
group.</i><p>

Who did what, when, and with whom on a standards body is always
a dicey matter, I expect.  There is a tremendous opportunity for
dragging one's feet while pursuing patents (et al.) behind the
scenes, taking advantage of the "insider information."  After you've
been in a standards body, the wisdom of <i>de facto</i> standards
becomes plain.<p>

I know of a case from first-hand experience where a 3rd party that
was privy to a standards body deliberation (it should have been
under NDA) applied for a slew of patents on others' work -- some
of it <i>my</i> work.  I'll just let you imagine the expletives
that I used, and where that company now sits in my esteem.  They
acted under the Japanese patent system, however.  Different rules
there, most especially that it's not the "first to invent," but
"first to <i>file</i>" who wins protection.<p>

You want an opportunity for abuse?!<p>

Here's my points in all this:
<br><b>. The multiple patent systems in the world need reconciliation
and reform, most definitely.</b>
<br><b>. I don't see how companies can say "yes" to a call for unilateral disarmament.</b><p>

Choosing who to do business with on the basis of who applies for or
wins patents is a bad idea, imho.  But choosing who to do business with on the basis of who <i>behaves</i> themselves with their patent portfolio, and who works for reform seems like a good idea (and
I do it myself).<p>

I haven't made up my mind on Amazon.  From my direct experience,
I know that most people are not going to be aware of who the worst abusers of the system are.<p>
