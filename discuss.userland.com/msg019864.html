I read it the same way.<p>

<i>And I rather thought that the unethical people of open source were the ones who claim that GPL is the *only* right way to release  software.</i><p>

Those people are unethical.  If what I said sounded that way, I appologize.  You should have control over what you produce, and I have no business telling you what to do with it.  If you don't feel the need to release source for your software, then don't.  I do feel that "need", so I release my minor tidbits for others to use.  I'm quite glad just to get a little note saying "Oh, this is so cool!"<p>

<i>I'd be really surprised to find that someone as rational as Dave was saying it's unethical to use free software without writing free software in return.</i><p>

He didn't (that I recall).  One thing he said was <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/08/19">"Our users will be reminded that if you love someone else's creativity, you must support it, in meaningful ways."</a> And <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/31">"When you see
                        something cool-but-free coming
                        from UserLand, think about
                        money, and the gift you're getting.
                        You're not paying for it, but you're
                        getting something that cost money
                        to make."</a><p>

It is these statements that I'm refering to.  I can empathize with this.<p>

<i>If you give it away for free, doesn't that mean you don't expect anything in return?</i><p>

If I GPL a piece of software, my primary intent is not to provide it to you at no charge.  That may be some people's intent, but it isn't mine.  If all I want to do is provide you with software at no cost, I'll put it in the public domain.<p>

By putting it under the GPL, I'm saying "Here's something I've done and I hope you can use.  I care very much about this and don't want to lose it.  Please enjoy it and make what you can of it, but share what you make."<p>

So, by GPLing it, I'm saying I care a whole lot about the software and I'm willing to let others have it and contribute to it and help me mold it in many ways.  But I don't want them to take advantage of me.  That is what <i>I'm</i> saying, but it's probably totally different than what rms is saying.<p>

<i>If you really felt that your efforts should be repaid with like efforts, why not stipulate that in the license.</i><p>

I think the GPL does a good job of approximating this stipulation.  If I released an end-user piece of software under the GPL (unlikely, since I don't do end user software), I'd want non-programmers to feel free using it without feeling guilty about not being able to code up some masterpiece.  However, if a programmer comes along and sees what I've done, I'd like him to contribute back.  The GPL handles both of these situations in a way I feel good about.<p>

In either case, I'd expect the person to recognise the effort that I put forth and realize that software doesn't just pop effortlessly into being.  I'm selfish that way.  I want to be recognised.<p>

Mark.
