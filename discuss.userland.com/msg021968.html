Before you answer the question, remember what Jerry says. "I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years, it's even worse than it appears." Now answer the question. ";->"<br><br>This afternoon I ran into a friend who's one of the people Al Gore visits when he comes to Silicon Valley. Of course we talked about the situation in Florida. My friend said he was upset with the way the candidates were dealing with it. I was surprised. I imagined that partisanship would rule. This person has raised a lot of money for the Gore campaign. I imagine Gore would return his phone call. I said I was hopeful our country would emerge stronger for this experience. My friend wasn't so sure. I'm going to make a phone call right now to tell him why he has to just look inside himself to see why I'm right.<br><br>What a year it's been. The dot-com collapse. Napster. A Subway Series. And now the US political system is shaken to the core. Murphy and Y2K, all the way. <i>Do we have a philosophy?</i><br><br>The Tampa Tribune has a county-by-county <a href="http://election2000.tbo.com/election2000/flacounty.htm">table</a> of Florida recount data. "With votes in 65 of 67 counties recounted, the tally collected by The Associated Press shows Republican George W. Bush leading Democrat Al Gore by 225 votes."<br><br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/09/election.president/index.html">CNN</a>: "However, the Associated Press, which has stationed reporters in every Florida county, put Bush's advantage over Gore at only 362 votes, a number drawn from results in 64 counties."<br><br><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001109/pl/election_carter_dc_1.html">Jimmy Carter</a>: "The American people should be patient."<br><br>Here comes an opinion. The time to be partisan is past. If the recount says Gore won, he won. If the recount says Bush won, same deal. Elections always have flaws. Our first responsibility is to support the republic and the Constitution, but stay politically interested, informed and active. That would be a true revolution, and totally legal, and totally powerful. The system of powerlessness is the one worth unraveling.<br><br>The user interface issue is fine for computer scientists (such as myself) to debate and learn from. But there are probably thousands of flaws similar to the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/westPalmBeachBallot.jpg">one</a> in West Palm Beach. We'll wait a decade to get all the glitches out (we should do it). In the meantime, the <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20001109/el/eln_florida_ballot_protest_1.html">call for a revote</a> is ridiculous. If it were done in West Palm Beach, to be fair, the whole country would have to have a chance to change their vote. When will the demands stop?

Are professional news people prepared for this? There are lessons here for the tech press, whose appreciation and understanding of technology is just as weak as that of the political reporters. It's inescapable, technology is part of every story from now on. Do we question what the technologists tell us? It's time to stop believing everything everyone with a <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=propeller">propeller</a> on his hat says. In other words, Murphy is running everything now.
