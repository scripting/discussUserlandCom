I actually choose a font in my C++ editor that is antialiased.  It is just a lot easier on the eyes.<p>

Also, VC (and the Windows SDK, I think) come with a cool tool called ZoomIn that lets you drag a window around and look at a magnified view of the screen.  W2K actually comes with an accessiblity tool that does much the same thing -- there is a frame at the top of the window that magnifies whatever the cursor is over.  If you move that around (and you have the right option set) you'll see lots of anti-aliased text.
