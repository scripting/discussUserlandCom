As for knowing the self of others, forget it. Know what they do and judge them by their works."<p>

<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/citation/wc991021.htm">Atlantic Unbound</a>: "Epinions could be called a 'productlog' -- a focused, for-profit version of what blogs have been doing for a couple years now."<p>

<a href="http://weblog.creedon.net/">Thomas Creedon's weblog</a> has all the features a weblog needs. A news page with an easy to remember URL, a calendar interface for back-issues (no linkrot when you point to his site), a discussion group, a search engine and an XML back-end. <p>

Peter Merholz runs the PeterMe <a href="http://www.peterme.com/">website</a>. He's a good designer, in fact he just landed a job at Epinions, as their creative director. I bet he gets some good stock options. Here's a <a href="http://www.peterme.com/webtech.html">picture</a> of Peter playing some kind of board game with Carl Steadman, Justin Hall and Taylor, all of whom I know from Wired. Peter will certainly do well at Epinions, he has no problem clearly <a href="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/petermequote.gif">expressing</a> his own opinion! <p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$12214">Eva Torrington on Sash</a>: "Have you actually downloaded and tried Sash? I did and it is very cool."<p>

Dennis Chao: <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~dlchao/flake/doom/">Doom as a tool for system administration</a>. "People frequently talk about 'blowing processes away', and the Unix command to destroy a process is Kill. This suggests a metaphor for process management. Each process can be a monster, and the machines can be represented by a series of rooms." <p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$12215">Listening to NPR</a>, an interview with some man, I'm thinking "This guy is pretty smart!" and guess what, it turns out to be Dan Quayle!<p>

<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,31830,00.html">Wired interviews</a> Tim Berners-Lee. "People keep asking me what I think of it now that it's done. Hence my protest: The Web is not done!" <i>Yes! But..</i><p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7696">6/23/99</a>: "Who would ever use two programs, one to read and one to write? Why isn't the web browser a writing environment *and* a reading environment? Because none of the engineers on MSIE at Microsoft use Hotmail for email. I can only infer that, because if they did, it would be usable as a writing environment, even in a rudimentary way."<p>

WSJ: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/325843.asp">WhereDoYouDrawTheLine.Com</a>? "With the surge in day trading, is it OK for employees to log on to make a quick stock deal? How about sending out e-mail messages from work supporting a politician? Or using office computers to hunt for a new job? And if any of this is permissible occasionally, just when does it cross into excess?"<p>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/10/circuits/articles/21pete.html">NY Times</a>: "The born-again iMacs are, dollar for dollar, the best computers Apple has produced in many years. Other PC makers will be racing to match the iMac's blend of high-tech features and simplicity."<p>

<a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/1999/10/17/osxing.html">MacWEEK</a>: "Can Apple be simultaneously revolutionary and maintain the status quo?" <p>
