What an interesting comment. There is a very large school of thought which says that the whole idea of objective journalism has led to a very stale, boring, and <i>inaccurate</i> style of journalism. Many believe that it is impossible to "leave your bias at home" and that the best thing one can do is acknowledge that.<p>

I read Scripting News even when I thoroughly disagree with Dave because I know his bias, because he's taken the time to explain where he's coming from, and because he is passionate about his beliefs.<p>

While I don't always like what he says, or how, I find it valuable precisely because he has not left his bias at home. <p>

This is not to say all journalists should do this. There is a place for traditional objective journalism, but "journalism" comes in many flavors.
