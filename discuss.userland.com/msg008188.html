<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/01/microsoftXmlRpc">1/29/99</a>: "I was surprised, my impression was that Microsoft moves in lockstep, that they execute quickly, but I found that this is not true. They interfere with each other, second-guessing and FUDing, internally, much more than they do with the outside world. As someone outside Microsoft I was much more empowered to move quickly than any of my collaborators at Microsoft."<p>

InfoWorld.Com's archives work again, here's a <a href="http://archive.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980710.whsoap.htm">pointer</a> to a story about Microsoft and XML-RPC from July 1998, but as Lawrence Lee <a href="http://news.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$8183">points out</a>, the story is horribly formatted. "It's impossible to imagine anyone that would be able to get past a few sentences without getting an immense knot in their brain." <i>Thanks to Lawrence for staying on top of this. Lots of good stuff in InfoWorld's archives.</i><p>
