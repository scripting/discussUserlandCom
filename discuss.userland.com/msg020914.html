Ya know, its all that monetization and capitalization that allows the Olympics to function.  More events, more participants, it all adds up.<p>

Those TV rights are worth alot of money to the Olympics, they have every right to protect them. <p>

Don't judge them too harshly, they have 2-3 weeks to earn enough money to last 4 years to plan and run the largest sporting event in the history of the world.  I can forgive them for not wanting to jepordize future Olympics with experiments in different revenue models.
