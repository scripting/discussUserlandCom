can evaluate any scalar in a string context and get a string out of
it.  For example, this Perl code:<p>

my $x = &#123;'a' => 'b'};<p>

my $y = &#123;$x => 'asdf'};<p>

print keys %$y;<p>

$y&#123;$x} = 'asdfw';<p>

print keys %$y;<p>

will compile and run.  But the output will be<p>

HASH(0x22850)HASH(0x22850)<p>

So you could use hash refs as hash keys if you wanted to, but it's
not likely you'll have a use for this.  (Two hashes with the same
contents will, of course, have different addresses, and the same hash
will continue to have the same address as its contents change.)<p>

Technically, you can't really have a hash as a value in a hash, either, but you can have a *reference* to a hash there.  (You can't even
have a reference to a hash as a hash key -- just its string representation.  If you extract that hash key later with 'keys', you can't dereference it.)  And you can have a reference to an array, or 
a scalar, or any of the other various arcane data types Perl has.
