and Microsoft don't support it.  I for one am tired of fussing with
providing navigational buttons -- browsers using <LINK> could do a
much better job than I can by hand (because each browser user could
set up their navigation buttons the way they want, instead of being
forced into my arrangement).<p>

While we're at it, regular expressions in Edit -> Find in Page would
be nice (and not exactly rocket science, as I coded a version of
regular expression matching for my own use in the early 1980's)...
