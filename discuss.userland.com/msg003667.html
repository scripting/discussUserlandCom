I think Dave Winer had some useful insights in <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$648">msg 648</a> regarding having all your documents indexed and available to be recalled by entering a search string.<p>

I think that insight applies to much more than just URL's and ought to be an integral part of any PIM.<p>
