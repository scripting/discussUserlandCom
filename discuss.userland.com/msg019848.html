Designers and writers almost never comment. Therefore all XML formats tend to evolve to please dedicated gutsy XML programmers, and freak out other folk, which imho defeats the purpose of XML, as a low-tech interchange format between applications written by programmers on all platforms, at all skill levels. <br><br>	One more thing, as a busy programmer, I also appreciate simple formats with simple docs. I read so many specs that I don't have time to understand. Unfortunately for most of the specs, the subtleties come right at the beginning, before I have a chance to get hooked.<br><br><b>A little bird<a name="aLittleBird">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/20#aLittleBird" title="Permanent link to 'A little bird' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	A little bird whispered in my ear that Disney and Yahoo are working on a merger. At the same time CNET and Yahoo are pretty close to merger agreement. <br><br><b>Cluetrain and (we)blogs merge too?<a name="cluetrainAndWeblogsMergeToo">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/20#cluetrainAndWeblogsMergeToo" title="Permanent link to 'Cluetrain and (we)blogs merge too?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.evhead.com/">Evan Williams</a> pointed to <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a>, a Cluetrain author who uses "Manila". Now I'd like to point to <a href="http://www.rageboy.com/blogger.html">Chris Locke</a>, a Cluetrain author who uses <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>. <br><br>	<a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/cluetrainArmadillo.gif"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/cluetrainArmadilloThumb.gif" height="69" width="50" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></a> I think weblogs are the flipside of the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>. Same philosophy. Empowering everyday people to say what they see. Let the cream rise to the top based on the quality of thinking, not based on whether or not, for some stupid reason, their opinions are "important". (How many idiotic Forrester quotes do you want to read?)<br><br>	I read Blogger sites and I read Manila sites. (I'd like to think) I read a site independent of what software they use, but I don't always live up to that. That's where I turn to the Cluetrain philosophy. Why should I hold myself back? Why shouldn't I learn from all people who have good ideas? <br><br>	I got a wonderful email from Chris yesterday. He found Weblogs.Com and discovered that <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/stats/findinweblogs?q=rageboy">he can ask</a> which weblogs are pointing to him. I hadn't used that feature in a while.<br><br>	Since he's sure to read this, Chris, also check out the "Hotlist", the most pointed-to pages in the Weblogs.Com database. <br><br>	(Ooops, I notice that it hasn't updated since 8/14.)<br><br>	To people who criticize weblogs, yeah it's a great big circle jerk, and it feels great!<br><br><b>Way down south<a name="wayDownSouth">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/20#wayDownSouth" title="Permanent link to 'Way down south' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Chris tuned into the tagline on Weblogs.Com, "Way down south in the land of cotton."<br><br>	If you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=way+down+south+in+the+land+of+cotton&hl=en&safe=off">search for that phrase</a> in Google, a page on Weblogs.Com comes up number two.
