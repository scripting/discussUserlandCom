I am speaking here in a very local community sense. I think people have traditionally received local news hoping that their particular interests have been covered. News will soon be presented by the makers. An example: Take a small non profit org in Anytown such as The Blueberry Figure Skaters of about a hundred members.  They will have a half dozen different programs for various skill levels. They will also have training events, competitions and fun events. RSS will provide a great opportunity for training and information exchange. A small town has at least a hundred clubs like the Blueberry Figure Skaters. What is needed - For presentation of scores and improvment levels. Very easy to use tables with auto linking of cells and calendars. How will it pay for itself? - Advertising (local) of coarse - Best to all - Ed
