I always believed that the US are a telecom heaven. My believes are shattered. <p>

My 2 Mbit line never goes down. I can be reached using my GSM mobile phone all over Europe and in more than 50 countries all over the world (except USA). Admittedly, I can&#180;t use my modem 120 miles south of here, because in Italy, they have a different phone jack and I&#180;d need a different power cable for my PowerBook . Still, this seems to be a minor inconvinience compared to the outages Userland experiences with their T1 line.<p>

May I ask how much you pay for the line? How much more would a T3 line be?<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
