People are raving about the new <a href="http://www.icab.de/index.html">iCab browser</a> for the Mac. Hey, does anyone know any of the developers of iCab? If so, I'd love to get this message to them. Microsoft supports an embeddable web browser control on Windows. The Mac needs this too. Microsoft said they aren't going to do it for the Mac. How about a DLL we can link to from Frontier?<p>

Tim Bray: "I moderated a presentation they did at XTech'99. It's Microsoft-driven, they're trying to build a protocol so that all the computer systems you need to run a school can talk to each other. When the kid signs in, he gets his library card auto-magically. It's all done with XML, loosely-coupled message interchange.  Reason it might work is that it's not hard to cook up a vocabulary that describes everything you need to know about elementary school students.  They claimed, loudly and repeatedly, that it was completely vendor-agnostic and not tied to Windows. Reasonable people will be suspicious, but the concept seemed sound."<p>
