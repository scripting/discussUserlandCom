Now on the Scripting News <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">home page</a> there's a box down the right edge containing the most recent dozen stories from Salon, Red Herring, Wired and Motley Fool. <p>

This is an unusual kind of syndication because it's aggregated. I chose four channels out of the hundreds on My.UserLand because they're well-known brands that are identified with the Internet, and they're not widely syndicated, and I like to stay up to date on them.<p>

It's an interesting and useful demo, but just one of many that are possible with the new power of syndicated content flow.<p>

<b>Screen shot</b><p>

Following is a screen shot showing what the box looks like right now. It recalcs every time I update the home page.<p>

This is the first time that story flow from My.UserLand has appeared off the My.UserLand home page.<p>

We will be distributing easy to set up software that will make it possible for any site to produce a box like this on their home page. It's now in testing with our core users.
