I have a great deal of respect for you, but reading these stories by Tony Perkins regarding Bill Joy does not lead me to the same conclusion.  Tony said Bill "introduced Java" in 1995, a true statement. Note that he is equating Bill Joy with Sun in these articles.  I don't see a direct statement saying Bill Joy single-handedly invented Java.<p>

You are not being fair, Bill Joy is not taking credit for things he didn't do.  Yes, Sun's PR dept, as of late, is building Joy's reputation as a 'do anything' man wrt computing; however, Bill himself is not overtly grabbing credit.  However, he is often the man with the vision.<p>

As I've heard it explained, Joy and Gosling came up with the idea of Java, together.  Other folks deserve and get credit too. Gosling did the early protos and his team did the heavy lifting.  Gosling is usually credited as the main inventor, even by Joy. But look at the Java Language Spec, you'll see three authors - one is Bill Joy.<p>

Joy also had a hand in getting the MAJC processor conceived and running.  Yet he still gives credit to his cohort(s).<p>

Did Joy invent Jini?  Yes - it is right out of his lab in Aspen.  Does he credit his team too?  Yes.<p>

That's just the way it works at Sun - Bill Joy helps formulate most of the big technical ideas - people come to him for advice and guidance.  No credit-taking there.<p>

As you so aptly put it, whatever.
