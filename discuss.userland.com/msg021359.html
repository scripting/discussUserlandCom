David, now that I feel that I've tackled the What is Open
Source question, I'm looking for the next challenge.</i><p>

Okay, and this is interesting to me since I've wondered
what to do about the problem.  I haven't said a whole lot
about Microsoft before, and it's largely because it's
complex, and not because I don't care.<p>

Dave Winer: <i>
When you say: "I think anti-Microsoft sentiment is one of the few
sentiments that nearly the entire computing industry agrees on" I'd
like to double-click on this phrase: "anti-Microsoft sentiment".</i><p>

That's a good focus.  Anti-anything sentiments are typically
corrosive and destructive.  But it's hard to stop a
Hatfield vs McCoys style blood feud.  It's one of the reasons
playing for blood is so taboo, because you can't stop it.
Except maybe if you have a sacrificial Romeo and Juliet
couple handy, or something.<p>

Doc Searls has written before on the mixed metaphors used by
competing folks, where some folks were sports based but others 
were war based.  (Maybe someone will link Doc's piece.)  The common
consensus is that Microsoft was playing for blood, and this
breaks the social contract that we don't play for keeps.<p>

The social contract can be fixed, but it requires that the
fixing become common knowledge (in the sense that Paul Snively
<a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$1859">
described common knowledge</a> to me recently).  Everyone has
to know the feud is over, and know that everyone knows it's over.
This requires creeping up on it in steps.<p>

It's possible to arrange that everyone meet in the same
ideological frame of mind by having discussions just like this
one, where folks discuss the status we want to target.<p>

Dave Winer: <i>
I'm not in interested in knowing why people have anti-Microsoft
sentiment, I just wonder if it could be expressed in words, what
is it that they would want Microsoft to do differently?</i><p>

I don't care about the causes for the sentiments either.  I'm
only interested in cooking up a set of memes that fixes whatever
needs fixing.  Everybody needs a new set of matching ideas,
with individual variations for Microsoft and the rest of us.
Does this require we describe the nature of the sentiment first?
Maybe, if it characterizes what problems need correction.<p>

It's perfectly right that we should state what we want
Microsoft to do.  This is what I want when someone criticizes
me.  I want to know what someone wants me to do.  (Sometimes
my wife tells me about something I did wrong, and all I can
do then is ask, "What do you want me to do?")<p>

Everyone thinks Microsoft might still play for blood, and they
might be afraid to stop out of fear of retaliation.  Of course,
the retaliation aspect is something Microsoft has played up in it's
official propaganda, when claiming it could be subverted any
minute now (glancing nervously at a watch).<p>

It would help if Microsoft took steps to increase the trust
others in the industry might invest in them.  But the absence of
any contrition in the aftermath of the justice department trial 
has tended to subvert any appearance of trustworthiness.  It's
necessary to establish that one will be predictably honest in
some contexts that affect folks from whom one wants trust.<p>

Microsoft need not be contrite about being a monopoly (even
though that would be easiest), but something must be done to
establish a track record of honesty.  This is a problem for them,
and they should give it some serious attention.  Lying all the
time (except behind closed doors with trusted developers) is
not going to work very well.<p>

Okay, let me see if I can summarize some of the sentiment in
few words.  Note brevity can cause some distortion.  All of the
following points are reasons why the computing industry might
continue to look negatively at Microsoft until these perceptions
are addressed.  I'm sure I've left some out, so don't treat this
list as definitive.<p>

Also, many of these are stated so strongly they might seem
like exaggeration to some folks.  (But to other folks, they
might all sound on target.)  In case anyone wonders, I largely
agree with all these.  However, I only voice them because
Dave Winer asks, and I hope that doing so can be turned to
a constructive purpose.  Please don't whack me in retaliation.<p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft doesn't share, and they have dibs on everything.
<li>Any competition is targeted with a scorched earth strategy.
<li>Only Microsoft has power, and negotiation is all defense.
<li>Microsoft downplays all software values from any other source.
<li>Bill Gates is portrayed as smart in proportion to richness.
<li>Microsoft's charitable donations aim to increase monopoly.
<li>Microsoft plans version obsolescence to drive recurring sales.
<li>Microsoft aims to hold cost of entry high for development.
<li>Microsoft encourages artificial scarcity to increase price.
<li>Microsoft designs to maximize dependence on their technology.
<li>Microsoft tells you anything to control your behavior.
<li>Most employees are forbidden to work openly in public forums.
<li>Microsoft continually crafts disinformation (FUD) propaganda.
<li>Microsoft enjoys a widespread network of 'objective' shills.
<li>Microsoft shareholders permeate computing media and analysis.
</ul><p>

Ugh, enumerating all this is making my brain numb.  I might think
of more later, but those are the first things that came to mind.<p>

Dave Winer: <i>
I myself have mixed feelings about Microsoft. Based on publicly
available info, and tea-leave reading, most of the time they
went against other products I think the Microsoft products were
better in some meaningful way to users. I competed against
Microsoft a couple of times, and always felt they were a lot more
fair to me than my other larger competitors were. I wonder
sometimes if the people who are "anti-Microsoft" understand how
cut-throat the software business really is.</i><p>

Yes, many Microsoft products have been fine ones.  And yes, the
software business is really cut-throat.  But even so, I think
folks could manage a smile sometimes despite the cut-throat
competition.  It's the threat of annihilation that makes it
hard to smile.  The aggressive pursuit of such a goal is quite
unnerving.<p>

Dave Winer: <i>
I just wonder what the substance behind anti-Microsoft
sentiment is.</i><p>

I know Microsoft has many employees every bit as smart as me,
and many others even smarter.  And all of them have marching
orders that say my place in the world is not useful to them
unless I work for Microsoft.  There is no sentiment of
"the more the merrier."  The game is played as if it is zero
sum most of the time, when it most obviously is not.<p>

Recently folks have talked about how unpleasant it is to be
ignored.  Even worse than this is to be hunted with prejudice.
