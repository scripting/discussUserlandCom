Are you having trouble because of the number of your users? Are you having trouble extending the framework in ways that UserLand may not have considered or planned for? What specific functions are causing you most trouble and why?<p>

All of this would be extremely useful input for Dave and Co, I am sure.<p>

Having said that, all of this stuff is very new and needs to be shaken out. Don't throw out the baby with the washwater. You'd be somewhat naive to expect *everything* to work right away out of the box without tweaking -- trouble is to be expected and looked on as an opportunity! :)
