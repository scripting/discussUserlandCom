I want to have all kinds of powerful tools, and I want them to work well together. Frontier's always been good about this--it speaks AppleScript and COM and XML/RPC and even strange new things like RSS. (It looks like Dave implemented that protocol in about half an hour, tops. Score one for Frontier and the glue layer.)<p>

Combining tools is powerful. Unfortunately, the mainstream press doesn't always grasp this--it's so much easier to write stories about Tool X "killing" Tool Y. Yuck.
