That Jini is targeted the way it is may be less political than simply strategic: Which is easier, to get everybody to throw over Windows for a distributed OS, or to slide a little distributed technology into those markets which will accept it?</i><p>

It won't work because it's a zig to Microsoft's zig.<p>

The only approach that can counter Microsoft is one that is inclusive, not exclusive. Microsoft already owns the high-ground in proprietary systems. That's why Java/Jini can't go anywhere until they let them out of the Sun container.<p>

Smart people at Sun tell me that the best way to understand them is as a hardware company. If they're promoting something it's only purpose is to sell hardware. They were a really poor choice as the flag-carrier for the "Outside Microsoft" cartel. They're even more limited than Microsoft.<p>

The problem with Sun's pitch, as it always has been, is that they require us to convert to Java to play their game. When you read the license agreement you realize quickly that they are really insisting that you slit your throat before working with them. Nothing has changed, that's still what they're struggling with.
