I'm using F6b4 now... how can I try this out? I presume I have to run some kind of script from Frontier... or is it an application of WebEdit?	-- IanAddendum from Frontier Edit	P.S. 2:41 PM: I did what Dave said to do in his response to this post, and it works! This addendum was added via outline on my copy of F6. Scary...<p><p>
