The built-in search engine totally failed in this area. The main problem is because there is no delimiter (a space in English) in these languages, so the search engine cannot even index a "word" (it took me many days to figure out a way to workaround it). I am just afraid that when going forward, as Userland develops more and more goodies into Frontier, yet having a non-international friendly foundation, it will make internationalization more difficult.<p>
