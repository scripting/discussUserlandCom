Why is that so freakin' hard to understand?  <p>

It's about lying.  Lying.  Lying.  Not telling the truth.  Taking an oath in a court of law and lying.  That's *bad". It's VERY bad if you are the President.<p>

It doesn't matter if it's about sex, peanut butter, what car you drive, or how much money you make -- it's still lying under oath and doing so repeatedly.  And encouraging others to do it for you.<p>

UNDERSTAND????<p>

Sheesh,<p>
