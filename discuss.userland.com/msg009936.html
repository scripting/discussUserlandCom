He's putting the book online freely available
for people to download both while he works
on it and after it's published (He's done this
before, with his Java book). According to him this
hasn't hurt the sales of the book (I printed his Java
 book and can testify that 500+ pages
of printout are no threat to the sales of an actual
book).<p>

His business model, making money off seminars rather than
books, is quite remeniscent of the open source business model
where the software is free and the programmer(s) earn their living
through consulting and support.
