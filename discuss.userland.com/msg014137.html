You only see the most recent day so you are not overwhelmed with information.  Other DG interfaces that have heirarchcial thread displays and such can be too much for a new DG member.  In fact a board I use that has such an interface, the owners decided to dump all messages older than 2 months because new users were having a hard time dealing.<p>

I'd like to put my plug in that the current daily display always be an option.
