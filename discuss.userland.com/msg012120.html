Thanks. That is the main reason I released it. I've used Frontier on and off since version 2, but was never inclined to write scripts to control the MacOS. That all changed with 6. I love building dynamic websites, and on top of that it isn't difficult if you have examples to learn from.<p>

Btw, I've found a few bugs and I'm almost done documenting the scripts so look for an update soon.
