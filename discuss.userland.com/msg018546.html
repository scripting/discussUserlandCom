When people buy Frontier, presumably the people at UserLand actually get paid.</i><p>

The problem with this is that, if artists <i>are </i>publishing their own CDs (such as in the case of Ani Difranco or Jane Siberry) Napster is even *worse*.<p>

Take away the labels, and you've still got a culture of copyright violation, which hurts the artists. I doubt that self-distributed artists are cut any slack on Napster.<p>

I suspect we'll eventually see more artists taking Siberry's approach, and reducing concert appearances to very expensive and exclusive affairs. A few dozen people paying $200+ each for an intimate concert.
