He suggests a synopsis is okay, but I'm hesitant about doing that.<p>

And attribution is very important, which is why Moreover.com's RSS feeds include the original source of each story in the description tag. <p>

I'd actually add three other rules of etiquette.<p>

1. headline links should spawn a new window.<p>

2. the source name should link to the publisher's home page, giving users the choice of a deep link direct to the article, or navigation as the publisher intended<p>

3. no direct links to audio or video, because that denies the publisher the opportunity to deliver an ad banner to the visitor, while increasing the load on their servers<p>

This is what we've done at our mothership site - at www.moreover.com. Question: how should we encourage users of our RSS feeds to follow those rules?<p>
