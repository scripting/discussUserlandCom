Apparently the Patent Office is jammed with applications for patents of genetic sequences. Once a company runs a sequence on a part of the genome, they can receive a patent, and anyone who does research on that segment must have permission, and any medical treatments they might develop will presumably have to pay a cut to the sequencing companies. If people start to wake up and realize what this means, the whole patent system may indeed be in for a major overhaul.
