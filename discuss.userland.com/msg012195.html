In the software biz, according to the conventional wisdom, the advantage of having a high market share is so great that a runner-up, even a runner-up with superior technology, is very likely to go out of business.  I don't know if this is entirely true, but it seems to be the conventional wisdom, and if VCs believe it to be true, then it's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
