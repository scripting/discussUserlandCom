My first reply to this was pretty vague and hard to implement in the short term, but a simpler starting place would be just a database of webzine sites, with publication schedule, archives url, and search url for each.<p>

If someone wants to write a Frontier script that can access such a database, I'll plug in the values I've figured out (various dailies, weeklies, and monthlies, mainly).<p>

A Frontier user would indicate which sites were of interest (ie, 
'subscribe'), and the script would wake up when a new issue was due.<p>

Maybe the Scripts menu could have "Go to archive page" and "Go to search page" items, too, that recognised the currently-displayed site.<p>

"Rearrange URL sub-elements into archived-page format" or "Extract persistent URL from local frame for bookmarking" are other possibilities, eventually.<p>

And if the individual's local database can be updated via a shared remote database, then it could also offer newly added zines: "Would you like to subscribe to Brill's Content today?"
