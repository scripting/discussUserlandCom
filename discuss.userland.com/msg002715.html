object in IE Beta 5 build 1309 and Frontier XML-RPC handlers.<p>

What's happening is we are getting Permission Denied errors when 
using the open method in many scenarios.<p>

The funny thing is on some scenarios it works perfectly.<p>

I say scenarios because there's not much ryhme or reason 
to why it works, but we suspect it's IE's security settings
differing from machine to machine.<p>

On my Win98 machine:
   Works perfect from a folder, but not from my local web server,
   intranet web server, or server on the internet.
  
On another intranet machine with Win98:
   Fails from a folder, but works from local web server, intranet
   web server, or server on the internet.<p>

NT4 yields similar results, some scenarios work, some 
(maybe I should say most) don't work.<p>

Playing with security settings yields moderate results 
like all of sudden it'll run OK ONCE, then fails ever after.<p>

Of course even if it worked perfectly, tweaking security isn't
the answer, as it should work with default security settings.<p>

Does anyone know what we're doing wrong with the control 
to make it act like this?  Microsoft???  <p>

Here's how you can check it out for yourself:<p>

  You must be running IE5 Beta 2<p>

  Surf to <a href="http://www.venuemedia.com/xmltest">http://www.venuemedia.com/xmltest</a> <p>

  Click Get Number of Messages <p>

  Should respond with a number > 0 or null that's OK.<p>

  Otherwise you'll get error on line 50 Permission Denied.<p>

  Try copying it to your desktop and running it local.<p>

You can also check out the messages, and add your own
by going to <a href="http://www.mailtothefuture.com">http://www.mailtothefuture.com</a> and logging in
as <a href="mailto:xmltest@yahoo.com">xmltest@yahoo.com</a>  the password is DUPIFDSCYJKV
and if you want to see the mail the Yahoo Mail password 
is xmltester.<p>

Thank you for in advance for any light you can shed! <p>
