The judge apparently thought otherwise, no idea why he ruled that way. Does anyone know the basis for his ruling out the use of DeCSS for non-infringing purposes? Wasn't that demonstrated at the trial? Didn't this argument get raised by the defendants?<p>

By the way, is there a DVD player for Linux that demonstrates this fair non-infringing use based on the DeCSS code? That would make the argument that much stronger, wouldn't it?
