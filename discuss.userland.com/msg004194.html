But does it really do garbage collection and manage
swap space?  In the old days (Mach/NeXT), if you
were a standalone user, printing/faxing all day long, you
would eventually have to stop or re-boot the system to
reclaim/reset the swap space.  Maybe they killed that
legacy but my big issue is with robustness.  Show me
the bullet-proof garbage collection and I'll start getting
interested.
