This paticular version is not meant to deal with hundereds of categories.  I made it simply because it was easier for the nontechnical people here to use a web interface than to figure out how their bookmarks and address books work.  And they wanted access on the road. <p>

The public/private/protected feature is actually on its way.  Professors here want to share their links, and we want it as an easy interface to keep a faculty list by department.<p>

I'm also working on a much bigger version to make a cool portal-ish thing.  <p>

Thanks for the feedback.
