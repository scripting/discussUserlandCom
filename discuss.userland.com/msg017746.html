	He did pretty well. And that was the period for doing that kind of thing. I think however, the war-to-end-all intruded pretty much on that particular spin of the 'revision thing' - and relativity made that simple fall of finding something seem - I don't know - a little slower that light. <p>

	If you were to look at the 'drug thing' from that particular perspective, it would seem inevitable. But it always is, I guess. <p>
