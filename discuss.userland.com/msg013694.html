Eliminates ISP lock-in. You own your content, you can move your site at any time. Also helps bootstrap a Manila ISP community.<p>

<a href="http://manila.userland.com/changes/611">Full list</a> of all post 6.1 changes.<p>

BTW, we chose a new codename for Frontier 7 today. <a href="http://www.pikespeakcam.com/template/camtop10zoom.cfm?IMAGE=011597a.jpg&ImageDate=02-14-97&ImageDescription=Early+morning+sunrise">Pike</a>. After Pike's Peak. A quick search on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pike%27s+peak">Google</a> reveals nothing controversial. I like it because it's one syllable, simple, and it connotes elevation, a breath-taking top-level view, and competitive performance. <p>

Why not keep Corazon? Too many people say <a href="http://www.tv.cbc.ca/healthshow/pastitem/cortison.html">Cortisone</a>.<p>

A bunch of people ask "What would Pike be?" <a href="http://www.outliners.com/">A hint</a>. ";->"<p>

<a href="http://wap.editthispage.com/1999/12/16">WAP Today</a> notes that Allaire and Phone.Com did a deal, and they ask "What are other CMS vendors doing?" Good question. What should we do? What's the quickest easiest way for me to get a WAP device so I can play with ideas?<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13701">Jason Levine</a> likes all the customizations he can do with Manila.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13702">Jeff Cheney</a> reports that you can get excellent donuts at the top of Pike's Peak. That's my kind of mountain!<p>

<a href="http://headlineviewerstatus.editthispage.com/">Carmen</a> started a Headline Viewer Status site. Good use of technology!<p>

<a href="http://geeknews.net/index.shtml#945525225">GeekNews</a>: "Well if you want to start your own personal web log for free you may want to check out Pitas, Blogger and Groksoup. But if you don't like free you can check out Manila for a free 60 day period, but it's $899 after that." <i>That's not correct. Hosting a site is different from having a license to run the software to host Manila sites on your server. UserLand doesn't currently have a price for hosting, we're thinking about it.</i><p>

<a href="http://www.flutterby.com/archives/1999_Dec/18_XMLforCalendars.html">Dan Lyke</a> has a proposal for XML for calendars.<p>

<a href="http://www.bump.net/">Bump</a>: "I have two redesigns of this site to choose from now. I built one in Manila and another with Blogger. They are really similar in some ways, but way apart in others." <i>Robert, it would be great to get a written comparison of the two. I've been emailing with Evan about projects we could do to facilitate connections between Blogger and Manila, and we gave a free Frontier 6.1 license to Pyra to help open this door.</i><p>

Postscript -- Robert took me up on the invite and <a href="http://www.bump.net/">posted</a> an extensive comparison between Blogger and Manila, including <a href="http://www.bump.net/screen/manialedit.gif">screen</a> <a href="http://www.bump.net/screen/bloggeredit.gif">shots</a> of both writing environments. <p>

Postscript #2 -- <a href="http://www.evhead.com/">Evan</a> is taking a long shower today!<p>

<a href="http://www.zymm.com/raster/">RasterWeb</a>: "There was a scare in an Oshkosh sk&uuml;le yesterday, someone had scrawled on a bathroom wall last week, 'This school will blow up on 12/13/99'. I'm disgusted by that. It's sickening really, I mean, these kids today.."<p>

<a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/discuss/msgReader$167">We reset</a> the categories on Weblog Monitor and archived the old category structure in an XML file. Now we're focusing on building out the <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/categories/Geography">geography</a> branch because that seems easiest and most straightforward.<p>

This morning I <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/discuss/msgReader$166">did some work</a> to streamline the processing of weblog ads. They're working much better now.<p>

Here's a <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/allads">page showing</a> all the ads that have been registered.
