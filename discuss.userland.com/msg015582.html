(our channel is at <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1598">http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1598</a> )<p>

This passes the netscape challenge (is displayed OK at my.netscape.com) and displays without problem in XML notepad, but my.userland.com shows "table: 2 items" where the description would be. <p>

Any ideas as to what would be causing this? would there be a way to use comments in our RSS file that wouldn't cause this phenomenon? <p>

Thanks for any input -- we are really happy with what RSS syndicating is doing for us.<p>
