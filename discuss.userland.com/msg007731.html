It's less important to see innovation within the browser market and FAR more important to see the innovation happening in the standards organizations and the tools to utilize those standards.<p>

Most of the focus is shifting towards XML, DOM, CSS, and other related web technologies.  A browser vendor isn't playing catch-up to other browsers anymore, they're playing catch-up to the standards.<p>

Take a look at the work being done at <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla.org</A>, not only are they fully implementing the standards, they are <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/ElevatorTouchyFeely.html">innovating</A> in the process.  Mozilla won't win because it's a better "browser", it will win because it implements a completely open next-generation platform.
