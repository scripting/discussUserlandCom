One of the things that probably escaped mention last night is that I can save incoming messages into a discussion group. There is a post delivery filter that does the minor parsing required, then shoves it into a DG. I'm not sure if anyone is using that code right now, but it does work to the point of being able to email images into a discussion group.<p>

I'd also like to add that at least for the time being, I've got the ScriptMeridian list availiable for people to check out the web<->mail interface. <p>

<i> That link is long gone... Sorry.</i><p>

Thanks<p>
