How are you going to mirror content? How are you going to admin all your machines? If these things are running NT, you are going to want to have a keyboard and mouse attached, though ideally though a Keyboard, Video, Mouse switch.  <p>

How much does disk I/O matter, how much memory do you need?  How well does frontier make use of >1 processor.<p>

I would say the sweet-spot, processor wise, is a 450 MHz PII or PIII.  The next step up costs you significantly more.  (Actually, for a single processor machine, I would go with a Celeron)<p>

Similarly, among multiprocessor machines, dual CPUs are your best bet price/performance wise.  (You can use a Celeron in a dual processor configuration, but I wouldn't mess around with that on a server).<p>

I just quoted out some 2U (3" high) rackmounts from dcginc.com.
For under $3000 I can get Dual PIII 450 MHz CPUs, 256 MB ECC RAM, 9 GB 7200 RPM UW-SCSI hard disk, dual 10/100 ethernet ports, 2 MB video 300 W powersupply.  This provides a reasonably well balanced machine that doesn't take up too much rack space for a good price.  It doens't include the OS (another $550 or so for NT server)
