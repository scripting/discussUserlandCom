Because this looks like developing into a major opportunity I would feel more comfortable (as would my partners) if I knew of other developers that could be called on to assist, if the need arises.<p>

If you are interested, please email me at <a href="mailto:aduncan@webwerks.co.nz">aduncan@webwerks.co.nz</a>, or reply to this post.<p>

Thanks,<p>
