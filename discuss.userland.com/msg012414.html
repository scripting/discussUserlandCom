<I>Huh? All four of these sites have excellent well-deserved substantial brand identities. They've all been around for years and years, and are pioneers in the net. Salon did a humble IPO, Herring just covers the IPOs, and Fool just took their first round of VC after many years of operating. You couldn't have picked a worse example to rant about vaccuous brands, these brands are notable for their substance.</I><p>

My apologies for the lack of clarity; I wasn't pointing the finger at any of the participants in this specific syndication effort (which, given that they've all provided RSS, really <I>would</I> be silly), but rather that there seems to be almost a pre-emptive concern, on the part of third parties, that these organizations <I>might</I> find the URL to encroach upon their brands. It's really the (IMHO) specious concern I'm reacting to; what I tried to do was extrapolate the concern to instances in which the concern might be well-founded, which led me to the weakly-based brand idea. It was not my intention to attach the idea to any of the four examples here--although if any of them <I>do</I> complain about the URL, I'll start to wonder...<p>
