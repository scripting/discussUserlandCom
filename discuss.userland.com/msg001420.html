This URL freezes Netscape.  Here are my specs.  I've tried this URL on 3 different systems.<p>

Mac OS v8.5.1
G3 desktop 300 Mhz
Navigator v4.0.8<p>

Mac OS v8.1
G3 minitower 300 Mhz
Navigator v4.0.5<p>

Mac OS v8.1
9500/150 150 Mhz.
Navigator v4.0.5<p>

The page partially loads and then blammo!  It just stops loading.  I can force-quit Netscape and the rest of the system seems fine.<p>

I'm a bit confused.  I don't see a way to generate a new topic, other than responding to someone elses message.  If I go to <<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/">http://discuss.userland.com/</a>> there is no start a new thread link that I can see.<p>

Several times, I've loaded the topics page, come back later and it's blank.  I try a super reload and that doesn't fill it up.<p>

How can I force a line break in this message?  The server is taking out line breaks I've put in.<p>

Any thoughts anyone has on these matters would be appreciated.<p>

Thanks,<p>

Toodle-loooooooo.......
