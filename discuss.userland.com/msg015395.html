Hello Dave,
<p>
I think there's a difference between pre-emptive offensive strikes through patent warfare, and desperate survival tactics like opening up the browser to forestall a looming all MS client side environment.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft had already eliminated the ability to charge for a modern, feature packed web browser by subsidizing the development costs with profits from cash cow os and application products.  Netscape tried a similar strategy, funding client development with a web site and server products, and in retrospect seriously whiffed vs. yahoo and microsoft.
</p>
<p>
So, strapped of cash to fund a loss leading product, they dropped back and punted (to paraphrase Mike McCue).  I can't see how this was misguided or anti-competive in any fashion.  What am I missing?  A full featured, standards compliant, and open source browser seems to be "ask what you can do for the internet" exemplified!
</p>

ps: I read Tim's follow up and he seemed to be more skeptical towards Jeff than you portray him to be, plus he had some constructive non-patent ideas for Amazon. I don't think he drank the kool aid yet.</p>
