Because Mosaic and Netscape came out of X Windows development, no-one really thought about whether it'd be possible to implement an alternative to those two options. Opera uses MDI, which is fairly nasty; but the Windows browser I currently like is Netcaptor:<p>

<a href="http://www.netcaptor.com">http://www.netcaptor.com</a><p>

which allows you to tab between browsers in a single window, all using the IE5 browser control. And infinitely preferable to designs which try to implement the tab metaphor within sites themselves.
