You can enter a domain name and get back the name of the organization that owns the domain.<p>

But there are a large number of other things that one can do with this  search engine.  For example, begin a line with "DO" followed by the name of an organization, for example "DO ABC Corp" and you find all the domains registered by ABC Corp.  <p>

Add a period following "Corp" and the engine returns all the registrations beginning with "ABC Corp."  Turns out there are six hits without a period and eleven hits if the period is supplied.<p>

There is just one problem with the Whois search, the search stops returning results after it finds fifty matches.  And displays a message, "Aborting search 50 records found ....."<p>

And since some companies have far more that fifty domains registered it would be very helpful to know all the domains they have registered.<p>

If anyone knows how to tell this engine to bring back all the matches please post the solution.
