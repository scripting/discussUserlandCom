You've taken time from your lives to enrich mine. You're too kind.<p>

I'd especially like to thank (in no particular order) Brent Simmons, Seth Dillingham, Matt Neuburg, Andre Radke, Leonard Rosenthal, Jim Roepcke, Dave Winer, and Alan German.<p>

You have all answered questions I didn't know I should be asking, and truly are the "crux of the biscuit".<p>

Many thanks,<p>

Daniel
