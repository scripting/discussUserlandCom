<P>
                      1.The author is not responsible for the
                         consequences of use of this software, no
                         matter how awful, even if they arise
                         from flaws in it. 
<P> 
                     2.The origin of this software must not be
                         misrepresented, either by explicit claim
                         or by omission. Since few users ever
                         read sources, credits must appear in the
                         documentation. 
<P> 
                     3.Altered versions must be plainly marked
                         as such, and must not be misrepresented
                         as being the original software. Since few
                         users ever read sources, credits must
                         appear in the documentation.
