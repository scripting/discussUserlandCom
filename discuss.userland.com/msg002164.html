The first thing I'd like to consider is recordsets. I believe they can be mapped onto <struct>s, but I'll address that in a separate message. In the meantime, for Frontier people, here's an example of a recordset:<p>

About special characters, we use entity encoding. Like &amp;lt; and &amp;amp;. There must be a list of all the mappings. I'll go look for them, if anyone finds them, please chime in.<p>

About XML-RPC to WDDX, I'm going to ask for help from the Frontier community. Josh? Seth? Jim? Matt? Henri? Deke? Brian? Anyone else? Hellllp! I'm working on editors now, when I dug into WDDX this morning I realized quickly that it's going to take me too far off my current course to be quick. If I have to do the work, I will, but this one of those times when I could use help from community members.<p>

PS: I never have figured out why plusses don't make it thru in the DG software, there must be some code in there somewhere that's stripping them out. A virtual golden keychain to any mainResponder tester who figures this one out.
