Does Gosling think Linux and Solaris are realistic alternatives? He should meet a real Windows user and stop blaming him or her for not caring that much about computers to get to know the beauty and elegance of Unix. Some people just like to use email and the web, take a few pictures, play some games. We can't all be Unix geeks.

Exactly.  If GNOME or KDE bring real ease of use to Linux and other Unix systems, virii like these are only less likely to show up because of the smaller number of users.
