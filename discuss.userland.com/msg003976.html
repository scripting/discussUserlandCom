Collected ideas produces lists of individual input that reflect just that, individual input. The fact that this is done in the group helps assure that everybody is getting heard, which is key to building consensus, but it is not until the ideas are structured that the consesnsus begins to be reflected. Because nothing gets moved without the explicit approval of the group.<p>

In the individual idea processing process, just as in the group process, it's important to keep these steps separate, because the intentions are different. If you start connecting while you're collecting, every idea has to get filtered before it gets recorded. ....Oh, let's see, this goes here. And this idea, well, I guess it should go there. And could you put this idea under there?...It introduces noise, and also makes the technographer's job a lot harder.<p>

On the other hand, the connecting part of the C-cycle is crucial to the development of a complete work. You can't write an article in lists. You can't make a plan without structure. The key is keeping those phases of idea processing distinct, in not trying to do both at the same time.
