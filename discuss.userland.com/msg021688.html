I haven't followed Notes for almost a decade; all my experience with it was after I shipped MORE 3.1 and we stopped developing MORE at Symantec. I had set up a Notes server and played with it, but kept thinking "wouldn't it be cool if we were networking MORE like this?"<p>

The biggest thing stopping Notes from being an RU-type product would not have been the lack of a <i>practical</i> Internet. Nor the lack of MP3. Nor pricing. At that time the world was just too caught up in WYSIWYG, something Notes wasn't. And RU plays a little closer to the edge, somewhere Lotus wasn't.
