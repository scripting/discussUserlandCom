"But the difficulty of the task quickly becomes apparent when we look at attempts to solve similar problems. The most obvious place to turn - library science - turns out to be of almost no help. For one thing, even librarians admit that the schemes used today are antiquated and inadequate: the phrase "classification in crisis" has become a clich&eacute; in the library community. The most common systems in the US - the Dewey Decimal System and Library of Congress Classification - were developed during the close of the 19th century. Unsurprisingly, they are poor at classifying knowledge in "newly" established fields like genetics or electrical engineering. More important, library classification is bound by restrictions that the digital world is not. While a physical book can be shelved in only one place, a digital document can be placed in several categories at the cost of only a few bytes."
