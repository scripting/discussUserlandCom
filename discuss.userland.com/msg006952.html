In relational database terms, if you delete a record from a database, you usually want to do a cascading delete (deleting record in other tables that refer to the primary key just deleted).<p>

It might be that deleting an account in UserLand's membership database would require they delete all the messages that account wrote.  This is just speculation of course, since I don't know the members.root/discuss.root structure very well. (I wish I did)<p>

One rule I learned early in database (schema) design was to never use meaningful information (such as SSN) as a primary or foreign key.  This is exactly the situation that that rule tries to help people avoid.<p>

If you applied that rule to members.root, a meaningless number would become the primary key for the record (which is the name of the account table), and the e-mail address would become an attribute of the record.<p>

An index could easily be maintained that allowed easy translation between the meaningless number key and the e-mail address, so that the e-mail address could be used to lookup records.<p>

(This is not a reccommendation, suggestion, or request, just conversation)<p>

Short answer -- it might not be as easy as it sounds to rename or remove a member record.<p>
