(better late than never?)<p>

I had some xml tables and all I did was (#renderTableWith xml.compile). cool beans, easy to publish xml.<p>

Unfortunaltly Frontier continued to publish all of the tables within the table I was rendering... and the glossary indexed all of them. Ugh. <p>

my solution was not use the renderTableWith directive, although I still think this would be a nice feature.
