"Come one and all" says Kate. "Come flame me so I can learn from it." I'm sure you'll get flames. They will find something about you that you don't like and pound it into you. You'll struggle to convince them that you're not really like that, but they won't hear you. My guess is that afer a few years of doing that you'll have learned all you need or want to learn.
