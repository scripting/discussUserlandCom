The session on Zope, led by Paul Everitt from Digital Creations was very productive. He plugged Frontier with a few compliments, after he had identified a Frontier user in the crowd. He even asked me  a few questions, for the sake of comparison, about the Frontier ODB and how Frontier handled inheritance during his talk. He explained and promoted XML-RPC. Paul gave a high energy, very informative presentation on Zope. <p>

I spoke with several of the other participants, and the general consesis was 'WOW!'<p>

I was asked about the Python track by some folks who were attending the Perl conference at lunch time. I did my best to extole the virtues of an object oriented application server tied to an object oriented database. They seemed to be a little curious, but mostly sniffed that there must be a 'performance hit' by using an application server, and Perl can do all that 'object-stuff' anyway. Oh well, you can't win them all!<p>

Anyway, it was a well attended conference and alot of fun, I would recommend it to any Linux developer or webmaster.<p>
