He was paid in stock options. <br><br>	A couple of years later the company IPO'd, one of the most spectacular IPOs during the frenzy. His options ballooned in value, when they vested last year his stock was worth <i>$10 million. </i>All his friends, myself included, were impressed. "Bob is very rich now," we all said. <br><br>	Of course he exercised the options. This is known at the IRS as a "taxable event." At that point you owe the government taxes on the value of the stock at the moment you exercised the options. Bob must have been confident in the value of the stock because he didn't sell any to pay the taxes.<br><br>	<img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/dotComBustStockGraph.gif" height="67" width="157" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="8" align="right">Now as the end of Y2K approaches, his $10 million in stock is worth less than $1 million. Unfortunately (this is the nightmare part) he has to pay taxes on income of $10 million. Figure it out. My formerly middle-class friend has to come up with approx $4 million to pay Uncle Sam and Governor Davis. Like most ordinary people this is an impossibly large number. Bankruptcy looms. <br><br>	I hear this is happening a lot in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. In the next cycle, watch out for irrational exuberance. Sell the stock to pay the taxes. <br><br>	PS: For most people, $6 million is <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney">transcendental</a>.<br><br>	Bill Seitz: <a href="http://webseitz.homepage.com/stock-options.html">Stock Options and the AMT</a>.<br><br>	Motley Fool: <a href="http://www.fool.com/portfolios/rulebreaker/2000/rulebreaker001121.htm">Meltdowns Always Happen</a>.<br><br><b>Yes she is!<a name="yesSheIs">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/21#yesSheIs" title="Permanent link to 'Yes she is!' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.amihotornot.com/r/?eid=S8OLG&key=SQNAF"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/kathleenHarrisThumb.gif" height="46" width="45" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></a><a href="http://www.amihotornot.com/r/?eid=S8OLG&key=SQNAF">Katherine Harris</a> is on AmIHotOrNot. BTW, I think she's <i>very</i> hot, I think it's curious that others don't, and of course when I was younger I wouldn't have. It scared me that women mature. Now I love mature women. Seriously. No sarcasm. This might be an optimistic thing for younger heterosexual men. No need to be so scared. Why do you think she's getting all those flowers? (BTW, she's four years <i>younger</i> than me.)<br><br>
