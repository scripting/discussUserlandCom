I just have to share this with someone :-)<p>

I tried to go to <a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a> this morning for some research, and I received a "Sorry, Forbidden" message on the main page. Weird, 'cause the guy at the workstation next to me could get in no problem...<p>

Anyway, at the bottom of the error page is a link that says "Webmaster", so I clicked through so I could drop a note. That's when the fun began!<p>

They basically dare you to find an email address to contact the webmaster. It's a tricky (and aggravating) game of hide and seek. If you've never experienced this before, try this URL:<p>

<a href="http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/FAQ.pl">http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/FAQ.pl</a><p>

and see how long it takes to find the webmaster's address.<p>

I guess I really can't blame them; they must have been getting crushed with mail asking bad questions. But I think their solution seems a bit convoluted.<p>

BTW, I still can't get to their main page from my workstation. Does anyone else have this problem? Curious...<p>

Happy Hunting!<p>
