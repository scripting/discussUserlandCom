He's very good at outlining the intricate and abstract approaches that were needed in the early days of Emacs and GCC. Again, I think there's an ideological gap here: RMS comes out of the Platonic idealism of MIT and the Lisp machine, where things have to be done <b>the right way</b> from the top down. (Philip Greenspun has a similar mindset, and he's proved that the combination of open-source tools with commercial technologies can be bloody successful.) On the other hand, ESR is more of an Aristotelian bricoleur, as can be seen by fetchmail, the quintessential bottom-up hack.<p>

But this week's discussion has been depressingly <i>ad hominem</i>, so I'll shut up now.
