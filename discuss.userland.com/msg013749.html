It is a language very much like JavaScript.  Currently, WMLScript offers rudimentary access to device information through the WMLBrowser library.  There is no graphics library supplied (a la Java AWT/Swing) for building a GUI.<p>

Java is not included in the WAP spec and is not supported by WAP phones.  One handheld OS (Symbian) supports Java and Sun has also developed what is known as the K Virtual Machine for handheld devices (such as Palm).  Java brings its own set of runtime performance issues to the table which may explain why WAP is divergent from it.  ...That and the telecoms not-invented-here complex...<p>

Jini is still lurking around and is the perpetual Next Big Thing.  Bluetooth is a personal area wireless networking standard, which is a low-power, short-range, wireless technology designed for local area voice and data communications.  Jini is a Java-only technology (surprise!) that defines a standard set of interfaces that devices can use to interact.  <p>

In other words, Bluetooth defines the communications layer...Jini defines the application layer.  The Motorola Piano project actually combined these two technologies however links to that page now simply take you to the Motorola Bluetooth home.<p>

Anyone care to explain Piano in more detail?
