I'm trying to track down some weirdness that I thought some of you might be interested in...<p>

I've got an RSS 0.91 file on our server at:<p>

<a href="http://www.fool.com/xml/foolnews_rss091.xml"><a href="http://www.fool.com/xml/foolnews_rss091.xml">http://www.fool.com/xml/foolnews_rss091.xml</a></a><p>

If you try to hit that URL with IE5, nothing happens; it doesn't load, no error occurs, nothing. I can't tell if the browser is not sending the request, or if the server is failing to send the file, or what. Now, if you hit the above URL with Netscape or another client (like a PERL script), the file comes across fine.<p>

I've looked at everything trying to figger out what's wrong here. The actual xml file is well-formed and parses fine by IE5 locally, and I know the file is on the server because other clients can hit it. I've changed the filename, the path, etc. but no matter what I do IE5 will not load the file! Grrr...<p>

This really doesn't matter, since RSS files aren't read by a browser anyway, but I'm still perplexed. Can anyone offer any insights or thoughts?<p>

BTW, the server is IIS4.0.<p>

Thanks!<p>
