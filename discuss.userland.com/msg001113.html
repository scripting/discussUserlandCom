DSL I've discovered is available in my area from US West. This will take me from 128K to 512K or higher, depending on what I choose.<p>

But I'm only just starting to research DSL, I don't know much about it.<p>

If you have experience with DSL, can you tell me:<p>

1) How long it took to get installed?<p>

2) Is your ISP responsive to service requests?<p>

3) Is it as fast as advertised?<p>

4) Is it reliable?<p>

5) If you had an existing LAN, was it easy to connect?<p>

6) Are there any gotchas to watch out for?<p>

Any other comments you might have are totally appreciated.
