After having problems with flaunch, the facesless app which appeared a couple of weeks ago, I decided to write my own. (For NT and 95/98 only.  Sorry Mac users, but you can Applescript this function very easily).<p>

You can ftp it from here:<p>

<a href="ftp://guest:guest@195.188.246.44/frelaunch.exe">ftp://guest:guest@195.188.246.44/frelaunch.exe</a><p>

When first run, it will ask you to select the path to Frontier.exe.  After this it will check every 3.5 seconds for Frontier's window class (called 'frontierframe', if you are interested.).<p>

You can Disable and Enable it by clicking on the 'Enable/Disable' button, so that you can do any housekeeping you need without quitting and restarting the app.<p>

Why 3.5 seconds?  Just to give yield time to any processor intensive tasks you may have running on your server.  To check every second, for example would slow things down, such as Frontier save scripts etc.<p>

Any questions, don't post them here as this is not the groups purpose, but email me: <a href="mailto:neil@netmedia-uk.com">neil@netmedia-uk.com</a>.  If any of you are programmers and wish to enhance frelaunch, modify it or whatever, drop me an email and I will return it with the source code (Delphi).<p>

Hope it helps,<p>

Keep pushing!<p>
