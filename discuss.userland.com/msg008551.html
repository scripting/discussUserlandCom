Just enclose your perl script in the "script" tag with runat set to server.  So if you have a perl sub Foo that you want to ouput to your page you can just Response.write(Foo).  There are some pretty good examples <a href="http://www.activestate.com/reference/aspSamples/index.htm">here</a>.  <p>

If your company develops components to run in ASP, you should also check out the Perl Developement Kit.  Version 1.2 beta has just been released.  You can get it from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/pdk">ActiveState</a>.  You can create ActiveX Controls with perl using this.  I haven't played around with it much yet, but it sure looks cool.
