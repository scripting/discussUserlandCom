This way every template/page and row in the table assigned to this template gets a unique physical page.<p>

StoryServer caches pages by first letting the webserver look for the document, if it doesnt exist the webserver "complains" to StoryServer that renders the page (with database content and all) and finally saves it in the filesystem. Next time the same page and unique id from the assigned table is requested the webserver finds the page and serves it without any StoryServer intervention needed.<p>

This doesnt always work ofcourse but for e.g. newspapers with articles this is optimal.<p>

Hope this sheds some light...<p>
