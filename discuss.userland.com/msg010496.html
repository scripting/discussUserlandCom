Play nice dude. We are trying to explain it to you. Saying that we're using "weak logic" is not furthering an intelligent discussion. <p>

I'll give it one more try. If InfoWorld says "Don't do it" I will respect that. I may think it's silly, but it's their content and their website, and if they don't want outside links, I won't link.<p>

Same with their aggregation flow. If they don't proactively say they want it, I won't scrape their site to synthesize it. Why? Because there's a copyright notice on their home page, and in my opinion, if I grab all the links off their home page, with a robot, I would be violating their copyright, again in my opinion.<p>

Lawrence provided a pointer to a pair of companies who believe there's value in a collection of links. Presumably, if the MarketWatch home page were being scraped and repurposed they would object. I will find a way to ask them that question. <p>

In the meantime, are any of the scrapers scraping MarketWatch? Links would be appreciated. Let's air this issue at a high level, with a real-world example. Thanks for listening.
