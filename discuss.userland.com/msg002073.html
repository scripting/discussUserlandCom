for Python (the language), get Zope (an application platform) (*).<p>

I haven't used Frontier or Zope's object database enough
judge if one is radically better than the other, but Zope
looks pretty competent to me.  And it's definitely tightly
integrated with Python.<p>

Maybe you can come up with a more detailed comparision
than "they think they have it but they haven't"?<p>

*) background: Python is extremely modular, making it
easy to mix and match components from different sources.
Saying that "Python doesn't have this or that" is usually
misleading -- chances are that there are components available
that does exactly that, and that these components will work
just fine with any already existing Python application.  Need
to access an Oracle database from your application? Fine, get
the Oracle module.  It's compatible with the Informix module,
would you decide to switch.  Or if you're doing a low-volume
site, use Gadfly instead.   Need to generate graphics and
images on the fly?  Fine, get the Python Imaging Library.
Want to serve FTP and NNTP from the same database?  Fine,
plug in Medusa.  And so on.
