If you read Scripting News in one browser window while reading my Web site in another, that's pretty clearly legal.<p>

If you put Scripting News in one frame of your browser, while putting my Web site in another, that's pretty clearly legal.<p>

If I write a JavaScript hack so that the commentary frame keeps pace with the Scripting News frame... I bet that's legal too.  I'm not modifying anything, or changing anything; I'm just making it easier for the user to read the commentary.<p>

(This is irrelevant to Dave's objections, of course.  I'm just commenting on the licensing idea above.)
