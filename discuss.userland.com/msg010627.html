By your COM statement, I'm guessing Win95.  Check this out:<p>

The <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/MAC/OE/oefeatures.htm">OE features page for the Macintosh version</A> refers to the ability to use Applescript.<p>

The <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/oe/features/default.asp">OE features page for the Windows version</A> makes no reference to scripting, nor can I find any mention of OE scripting.  Outlook alone, yes, but not Express.<p>

I can't speak for Eudora, but it looks like OE is not scriptable in Windows.  (Wow!)
