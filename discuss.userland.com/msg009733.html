I had occasion to work for Compaq technical support for a few months between
jobs and can fill you in a bit on them. <p>

First of all when you call Compaq
you are not talking to Compaq at all. Oh they will say they are Compaq but
who they really are is <a href="http://www.sykes.com/co_index.html">Sykes Enterprises Inc</a>. Sykes has a contract with
Compaq to do technical and other types of support (I worked technical
support) Sykes hires just about anyone that walks through the door for these
jobs and gives them about 2 weeks worth of training. In the group I trained
with only I and one other person had any computer background at all some had
never even used a computer.<p>

How to deal with Sykes Enterprises.<ul><p>

<li>Ask then what site they are at. They will give you a site number. Sykes
has various sites around the world. For Compaq technical support most call
are taken from the Hays, Kansas site.<p>

<li>Ask them how they like working for Sykes. There is no better way to get
your case moved up to a supervisor than to mention the name Sykes
Enterprises to Compaq technical support. Sykes employee are under threat of
termination for revealing to a customer that they are not really on the
phone with Compaq. They will move you to a supervisor quick to get you off
their phone.<p>

<li>If you have a problem which is not getting solved ask for the escalation
desk. If all else fails ask to speak to the site supervisor, one is always
on duty. Tell him/her that you know you are speaking to Sykes enterprises
and not Compaq. You should at that point be taken care of.<p>

<li>Sykes could lose their contract with Compaq if Compaq ever feels that
Sykes is not keeping the public from finding our that when they call Compaq
they are not really talking to Compaq. So any mention of the Sykes
Enterprises name tends to freak them out.
