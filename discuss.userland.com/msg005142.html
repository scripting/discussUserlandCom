What I'm hoping to hear is that it's minimal, with the ODB carrying most of the load. In our production-oriented corporate setting (a newspaper) installing "unofficial" software is something we do carefully. I'd set up a test machine first, in any case, before futzing with the one I rely on. But I'd appreciate a read from folks who've gone down this road already.
