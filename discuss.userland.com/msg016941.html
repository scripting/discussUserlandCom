I have a CGI program (an EXE file) which runs behind IIS4 (in /scripts/) and Apache (in /cgi-bin/) on NT4.  Everything works great <B>except basic authentication!</B><p>

Both web servers INSIST on doing the authorization itself, but my CGI program needs to be allowed do <I>it's own</I> authorization -- ie: let the CGI program determine if the user/password is correct, and react accordingly.<p>

IIS4 hijacks the username and password sent by the browser and doesn't let the CGI see it, and tries to authenticate it using the NT user database.<p>

Apache insists that if I set AuthType to "basic" for /cgi-bin/ that I specify AuthUserFile and/or AuthGroupFile as well, meaning that Apache will do the user/password check against some password files.<p>

If you know how to disable this interference by either web server, I'd be so so grateful if you could share that information with me!<p>

Thanks!<p>
