I looked at your site, and even though Scripting News has been updated several times this morning, it doesn't show up in your list. <p>

Ooops, on second glance, there it is, at 1:30, far down the list. Now I wonder if LinkWatcher has a bug, or if there's a bug in my understanding of how it works.<p>

Another question, is the list of weblogs you watch open or proprietary? In other words, if I wanted to compete, would I be able to build on your list or whould I have to reinvent the wheel?<p>

BTW, this is my complaint with Jorn's weblog FAQ. I already have so much work to do, I'd rather just point to his FAQ, but he doesn't point to Scripting News.
