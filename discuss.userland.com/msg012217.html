This sounds somewhat reminiscent of things I have heard discussed here, such as outlining integrated with code editing. Any thoughts?<p>

>>From the docs/howto.xml file in my literate programming package:<p>

    <p>Literate programming is a technique for combining computer
    program source code with commentary about how the program works,
    in such a way that both compilable program source and a easily
    understood human-readable version of the program can both be
    generated.  Literate programming systems allow the flexibility to
    structure the program text in an order that makes sense for
    explaining the program, rather than paying attention only to
    the needs of the compiler.  They also provide the facilities to make
    the human-readable output more visually attractive than a simple
    program listing, often including things such as diagrams, mathematical
    equations, a detailed index, and (in some systems) pretty-printed
    program listings. </p><p>

    <p>Donald Knuth invented literate programming while designing his
    TeX typesetting system.  The TeX and METAFONT programs are written
    using the <cmd>WEB</cmd> system, which combines Pascal program
    text with commentary written using the TeX typesetting language.
    Since then many other systems have been built, supporting
    programming languages other than Pascal, and publishing systems
    other than TeX.  The most popular of these are <cmd>CWEB</cmd>,
    <cmd>noweb</cmd>, and <cmd>nuweb</cmd>.</p>
