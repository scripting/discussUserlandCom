I like this idea a lot. How or what should I do to make my site better for cloning? <p>

Yes, I know I need to clean up the validating - which I'll do.<p>

But, I'm concerned about a moreover.com storybox. This is a gem stored as a bit of javascript. I also have a Userland storybox and both are contained within a bit of javascript that only allows them to appear on the front page.<p>

And, I have an AIM remote control thing...<p>

And what about the settings? For instance my site is not syndicated. Others will have news items enabled, will all these setting 'go' with the clone?<p>

And are you saying we can have a button on our site that says 'clone me' ? That would be cool.
