I want to be able to say, in HTML, "this link goes to this page, unless the viewer has/has not yet seen this other page/pages (either this session or ever), in which case, send them over to this other page."<p>

This can be done in CGI, and some feel it takes too much control away from the user. But CGI is hard, and doing it in CGI takes away more control from the user than doing it in HTML would.<p>

The real Holy Grail is, of course, reverse links. Netscape may be trying to get to this with their Alexa alliance.<p>

And I concur about the outliner stuff.
