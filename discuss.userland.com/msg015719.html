ManilaPalooza was great. Even though I'm kind of embarrased that my demo of Sam Reynold's Filer plugin didn't work, it wasn't enough to prevent me from still having a total blast! (I still don't know why my password kept getting rejected, it worked this morning at my friend's place in La Honda.)<p>

It was great to put faces with names. Does anyone else think that Matt looks like a cross between an Impressionist painter and a 30's Hollywood swashbuckling movie star? Of course I knew what Dave looked like, and Brent, Sheila and Andre too. But hey, <a href="http://march25.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$296">Ken Dow</a>, Bob Bierman, Eric Soroos, Erin Clerico, Tom Clifton, Andrew Woolridge, Susan Kitchen, Phil Suh, Kate Adams and many more, what a gas. Ya'll are great. I hope this sort of thing happens again. If Austin is ever considered I volunteer to help with local arrangements.<p>

Okay, time for bed. Tomorrow PIKE!<p>

Later.
