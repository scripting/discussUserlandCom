Before my Mac crashed, it appeared to be working OK--conversing with the sampleNewsSite.  When I restarted, I get the error when addressing /console/consoleSite that it can't find a sub-table named "t"<p>

I'm not sure where this table is supposed to be.  Is it bad data in Discuss.root?  News.root?  Where should I look?  What should I look for?
