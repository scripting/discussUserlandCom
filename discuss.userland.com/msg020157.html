<P>
Not true at all. Microsoft destroyed the market for Netscape's browser via predatory practices. 
<P>
<i>Many companies make compilers for many different processors that gcc also supports. People buy them.</i>
<P>
Those companies' numbers are dwindling. There were dozens in the 80's; there are only a few now. At the current rate of attrition they soon will all be gone.
<P>
<i>It is only unethical to destroy worthy businesses through means other than competition.</i>
<P>
What GCC does is not competition. It is predation. It is anti-competitive.
