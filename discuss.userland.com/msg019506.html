To me, one of the core strengths of Userland is your intense design and marketing focus. <p>

While I can see that Radio Userland fits, I, unlike casual folks, have also been paying extreme attention to Frontier over the past three months.<p>

To the casual user/netizen, couldn't Radio Userland feel like line extension? Indeed, haven't a few long-timers even asked this question? <p>

Anyway, I'm suggesting that one or two DaveNets that place this squarely in the ongoing development trajectory, supplying some technical detail and looking backward (history) as well as forward (vision), might be a real help.<p>

To give one specific, while music is killer and there is always good reason for Userland to release a cool Frontier app layer (a la Manila) for the music world, how do the new features/design/structure map to the long-time Userland vision of reading-writing the Web? How can developers take the new structure and generalize for use on other Web data and/or application types (that is, what do you foresee and/or hope for)?<p>

I'm certainly not trying to tell you to do something. This is just a sincere request from a user who agrees with you about the perils of line extension - not only real line extension but perceived.<p>

If not a DaveNet, just some discussion would be helpful ;-) .....<p>
