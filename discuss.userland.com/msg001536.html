As I understand it, Frontier is currently only a COM server. If you could make it work as a client too (hint!), you could do what you wanted more elegantly (assuming IE's COM works the way it should).<p>

Be warned that DDE is somewhat broken in IE. It does return some URL, but not always the front window URL. It even returns "about:blank" when the user opens a dialog (like prefs). And sometimes it will refuse to notice when a background window is brought to front. This may all have to do with the "Browse in a new process" setting in "Internet Options".<p>

Have fun!
