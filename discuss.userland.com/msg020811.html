I'm not directly involved.  In fact I don't want to be involved. :-)  But it's clear to me you were dispossessed by the naming, and very
intentionally so by the folks who chose the name.  I'm sensitive to nuances in dispossession.<p>

It's not clear reviewing the specs would help pass judgment on the naming issue, since names are usually more relevant in the surrounding context that distinguishes a thing from what it's not.<p>

Only two main things matter in gauging your dispossesion.  First, you were a voluntary party to an earlier version of RSS with certain characteristics.  Second, you were involuntary party to the re-use of the old name for a new (but somewhat related) version with strikingly different technical characteristics.  Case closed.  They owe you.  If they don't pay, then they suck.
