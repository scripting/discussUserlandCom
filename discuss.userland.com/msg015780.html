"Davenetics?" he asked. No DaveNet. "Ohhh, never heard of it."<p>

A friend called this morning after reading the piece. "Oh no don't stop!" she said. I thanked her. The conversation continued. "What are you doing?" she asked. Doing tools for writers. "Why didn't you write aboiut that in Davenet?"<p>

On Tuesday, talking with the CEO of a company we're partnering with. I ask how is what you're trying to do like what I do? "You send out emails I'm doing websites."<p>

With Scripting News I connect. DaveNet is a tired format for me, and I think it translates to the readers. I think very few people are reading DaveNet. I think a lot of people get it, few people read it.<p>

My opinion, but it's a far cry from the early days when a DN piece could visibly change things, imho for the better. These days it's some different formula. To be free to find that, I have to change the way I work.<p>

It's hard to imagine that I won't write 3-5 hour essays in the future. But I'm only going to do it if they get read!!
