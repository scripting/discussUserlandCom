There's been a change there..<p>

We're no longer distributing the source to the My.UserLand.Com website. We can't because it builds on a lot of unreleased code.<p>

So, myUserLand.root now just contains the myUserLandSuite table, which contains most of the scripts used by the website. From this starting point you can build any kind of interface on the RSS syndication functionality. It's very advanced Frontier coding, not for the faint of heart. However, if other people want to release websites that build on this code, this would be great, esp if they address the questions and concerns that people have raised here.<p>

Anyway, you should be able to update myUserLand.root thru the usual subscription routine. It's hosted at my.userland.com of course.<p>

Also note that the Easy Content Syndication approach does not require myUserLand.root, and in fact it should be easy to do the same thing from any scripting language with a HTTP client verb.
