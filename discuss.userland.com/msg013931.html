I've been working on a <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/about">Weblog FAQ</a> that explains what a weblog is, and has pointers to early weblogs. Here's one of the earliest weblogs, until now, missing from the list. It's the first <a href="http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~clau/mozilla/home.mcom.com/whatsnew/whats_new_0693.html">What's New</a> page on Netscape.Com from June 1993. <p>

Here's a <a href="http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~clau/mozilla/down8.html">list</a> of 17 What's New pages from the <a href="http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~clau/mozilla/down.html">Netscape Time Capsule</a>. This site is an incredible resource. Thanks to whoever put this up. In yesterday's DaveNet I asked "This was the year that Netscape became the hole where the Internet used to be. Where is the Internet now?" It's great to get such a quick, concise answer!<p>

Thanks to <a href="http://metafilter.com/">Metafilter</a> for the link to the Netscape archives.<p>

<a href="http://phillyfuture.editthispage.com/">Philly Future</a> has a great future, imho. Karl Martino, the guy running it, is one of the webmasters at Philly.Com, which is run by Knight-Ridder, the same company that runs the SJ Merc. Karl got interested in Manila when he heard that Dan Gillmor was <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/">using</a> it.
