Richard Stallman generally doesn't require a sympathetic audience.<p>

To make a long story short, RMS makes no secret of his views. In person, he'll preach to anybody who stands still. (Actually, I can be nearly as bad myself.)<p>

But though I'm appalled by Stallman's lack of manners, I've never doubted his personal integrity. He's <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">entirely open</a> about his motives:<p>

<blockquote><i>If your business is selling an operating system, you will not like GNU, but that's tough on you.</i></blockquote><p>

...and:<p>

<blockquote><i>Probably programming will not be as lucrative on [my] new basis as it is now.</i></blockquote><p>

I disagree quite strongly with several of Stallman's favorite beliefs. But I trust him to be honest with me.<p>

For me, these are two entirely different concepts.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
