That's not correct, they are not part of the open source community if they are not willing to make their source open, it has nothing to do with the GPL in that context.<p>

In contrast, many vendors are choosing to sell closed/proprietary software on open source operating systems, and yet still not join the "open source" community in regards to opening their software.
