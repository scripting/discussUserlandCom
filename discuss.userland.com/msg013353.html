They are IE4/5 Windows only but still quite impressive.<p>

Also, I believe the <a href="http://www.homestead.com">Homestead</a> folks have implemented a similar, but more sophisticated, toolset in Java.<p>

Wouldn't it make sense to have these kinds of tools an option in Manila? Supporting Macs and Linux would be tricky but worth investigating.<p>

Ever since the Web began, I've been searching for "edit this page" and trying to make it work. I always hoped it would be WYSIWYG but I settled for textareas too. However, I always thought that DHTML stuff was an excellent proof of concept. I wish I wrote it!<p>

However, I did implement my own 'edit this page' back in '98 on a <a href="http://www.morganmedia.com/insite/">little known kids site</a>. So, do I get a free copy of Frontier as a consolation prize, perhaps? ;-)<p>

Actually, some of the work we did might be interesting to the developers of Frontier. Please <a href="mailto:rich@skillsvillage.com">content me privately</a> if you want to arrange a quick demo of the administration features.<p>

Anyway, I'm quite excited about "the other half of the Edit this Page vision" and I particularly admire Dave's thinking in using a separate application as the editor.<p>

I always knew "fractional-horsepower" Web servers would be a part of the puzzle. For me, I hoped it would make real Web applications viable offline so that I could justify it in the old days. The complaint was always "why would someone pay to use your product/service when they have to pay for the Internet access at the same time?" That still makes me smile...<p>

Well enough rambling and nostalgia. I am really excited to see this stuff take shape and I really want to be a part of it.<p>

PS: huge congratulations to the Frontier team on shipping  6.1!<p>
