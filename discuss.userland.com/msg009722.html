They seem to try harder because they are trying to catch-up with the Dells and Compaqs of the world.<p>

Also, they make make fast machines, their prices are lower (you can get a fully loaded PIII 600 with a 17" monitor for $1800), they provide lifetime phone support (unlike Compaq who charges you after the first few calls) and you get some free training through Micron University (although you probably don't need it).<p>

Oh ya, they will sometimes deal on added memory and accessories - try that with Dell.<p>

All in all, they seem like the best value going right now.  I've only had positive experiences with them.
