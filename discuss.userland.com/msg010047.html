IE 4.x for Mac still doesn't support them, per this site.</i><p>

actually in real world situations, it does. That's because the Quicktime plug-in handles it. Since IE has been pre-installed on every system since 7.6, it is pre-installed with the quicktime plug-in.<p>

so unless someone does a clean insatll of the system and selectively chooses not to install IE, and then later installs it, IE 4.x on the Mac does PNG.<p>

make sense?
