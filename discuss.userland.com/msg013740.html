"Recently, our journalistic integrity came under suspicion. In October, we published an issue of the Los Angeles Times Magazine devoted to the opening of Staples Center. As our stories noted, The Times is a founding sponsor of Staples, but we did not disclose to our newsroom or to you, our readers, that we shared the profits on this issue of the magazine with Staples. That was a mistake."

The publishers of the Merc set a high standard for taking action, even when there was only an appearance of a compromise of journalistic ethics.<p>

Now it's the business people's turn, and they really did something wrong. How far will the publishers go to demonstrate their commitment to the ethical standards of their industry?<p>
