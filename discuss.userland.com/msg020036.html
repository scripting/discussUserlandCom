=======================<p>

Here's mine (It's pretty short):<p>

If the programmer or company provides its source code to you and lets you read it, then it is Open Source - regardless of what license or restrictions they put on source code use (and regardless of whether OpenSource.Org recognizes their particular licensing agreement as "valid").<p>

If the company does not provide the source code, then it's not open source.  <p>

I think that's relatively simple and straight forward avoids a lot of baggage and silliness.  To see my take on the recent Sun and IBM discussions, see:<p>

Open Source Politics
====================<p>

Personally, for myself, when I post source code, I grant unrestricted use of source code - or something simple like requiring the copyright notice be carried with the code.  But I think agreements can have all kinds of flavors to suit different purposes.  <p>

I like the idea that when you post source code, you are creating a public resource.  But I don't object to some other company having their own restrictions.  That's up to them.  <p>

And sure, you can ask someone to give something away.  But it's still theirs to give.  Giving is a question of the heart.<p>
