which is cool because the vast majority of everywhere is empty...which recursively loops us back to the fact that like some very famous but prolly dead guy said "We are born alone, live alone and die alone" which I say to people frequently...especially as they start down some empty path--->go read "The road not taken" carefully and you realize that Bob Frost is just telling us..."IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH PATH YOU TAKE...THEY ALL END IN DEATH." Remember, he says <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/51.html">that the roads equally lay</a> in fact, he even takes the one who wants wear...what experienced hiker doesn't take the less traveled trail...grassy and flat from not being walked on...

So, it <i>is</i> as Dave says, about me...even when it is about you...that is why we secretly love bad news on television...and why we are excited by our firestone tires on our exploders being scary....and we love even more if we don't have an exploder with firestones but our friends do....

ahh well...poetry and heart attacks aside....I return to Frontier to figure out what I'm doing....
