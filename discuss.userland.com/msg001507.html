I do it myself, lots of people hurl personal accusations at me. Some of my friends even do it (we don't stay friends very long if they don't listen to me when I ask them not to do it).<p>

There's no doubt this is a devisive issue. It gives us all a chance to learn about our own values, and find other people who parse things the same way. But I can change my mind, and am happy to do so if people present facts and views that stimulate new ways for me to think.<p>

Anyway, thanks for your help.
