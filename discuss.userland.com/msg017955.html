umm.  just like writers don't make any money from their books,
or programmers don't make any money from their programs?<p>

but okay, leaving the money out of this, do they agree that an
artist's (musician, writer, programmer) should have any right to
control how his/her material are distributed and duplicated?<p>

if napster moves from mp3's to exe's, is it okay for them to
distribute fully usable copies of frontier?<p>

is it okay for them to distribute printable copies of my ematter
book?<p>

what's so special about music?  it's just bits and bytes, right?<p>

[just checked, and sure: you can get stuff from napster that's
<i>only</i> sold by the artist himself, via mail order.  still
think napster's only screwing the big guys?]
