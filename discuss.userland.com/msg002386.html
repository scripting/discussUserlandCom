I always use the calendar to go back one day to see if I need to catch up with messages from the night owls.<p>

For the last message retrieved by a user, would it be possible to store either the message number or the date? I don't know if makes sense to update the cookie or keep it server side. Wouldn't this allow nirvana to place the user on a page where he/she can pick up where they left off?
