While there is a comment area on <<a href="http://www.stephenking.com">http://www.stephenking.com</a>>, apparently all the comments are reviewed by staff before being released to the public. While I respect Mr. King's right to exercise this level of control, it does strike me as unweb-like. Since it was this site that prompted me to comment (indeed, that made me aware that Mr. King's site existed, and this from a decade-plus-long King fan), here are my comments, in their entirety:<p>

(Aside to non-King fans: "I'm not your #1 fan" is a tongue-in-cheek reference to "Misery," a story in which a writer is rescued from a horrible car accident by a psychopath who claims to be his #1 fan.)<p>

"Dear Mr. King,<p>

Let me begin by saying that I'm not your #1 fan. :-)<p>

Next let me thank you for taking the leap of faith of making "The Plant" available on the honor system. I would very much enjoy reading your latest work.<p>

Unfortunately, while the only means to pay for it is through Amazon, I can't: Amazon is engaged in flagrant abuse of the patent office by virtue of having patented both "one-click shopping" and "affiliate marketing" systems, systems that, as a professional software developer, I know are both not original concepts and have prior art. Consequently, I'm boycotting Amazon; they represent, in cyberspace, the very 'Big Publishing' entities that you are attempting to circumvent.<p>

Please let me strongly recommend that you instead accept payment through mechanisms such as <<a href="http://www.paypal.com">http://www.paypal.com</a>> or <<a href="http://www.e-gold.com">http://www.e-gold.com</a>> until such time as there is a widely-accepted micropayment or digital cash standard.<p>

Many thanks and best regards,
Paul Snively"
