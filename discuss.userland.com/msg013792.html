xmlTree's OCS file doesn't include WML content - the OCS file is only produced to help Carmen's Headline Viewer users, and only contains RSS0.9, RSS0.91 and ScriptingNews content.<p>

More and more WML is being added to xmlTree (we've got a backlog of sites waiting to be added), and can be found easily by filtering for it - i.e. <p>

BTW, if you're interested in learning about WAP, I suggest downloading the Nokia WAP emulator 1.2 or 1.3 beta, which contains reference and user manual material in PDF form.<p>

Hope this helps<p>
