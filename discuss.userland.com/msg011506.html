If the objectionable material were coming through Third Voice or something similar, but wasn't *on your page*, why would your page be affected, rather than Third Voice's service?<p>

More likely, schools would elect to not allow Third Voice, or to disable similar features should they appear in web browsers. Otherwise, the *entire* web could become off-limits due to inappropriate ThirdVoice comments. I think schools have enough
presence of mind to determine that Third Voice is the culprit, not the websites to which messages are attached.
