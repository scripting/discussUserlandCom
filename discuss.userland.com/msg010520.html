I've done this after a fashion (<a href="http://news.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$10101">announced it before, perhaps cursorily</a>):<p>

You can grab any channel this way.  My original message may have been a little short, but the point is that anyone, anywhere can include any channel on their web page with:<p>

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript SRC=http://www.wc.cc.va.us/dtod/includeChannel/JSChannel.asp?c=266></SCRIPT><p>

where the number is the number of the channel.<p>
