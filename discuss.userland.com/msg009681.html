There's lots of code that depends on this being an actual, not virtual, file location. <p>

Look at it this way, when you want to move Frontier, because user.databases is there, and if you use it, you just have to do a Find-and-Replace in one place.<p>

We could hack something together that would patch the location at startup, but that could be a big problem for some people someday. I don't like that kind of smartness in a programming system, in end-user software, ok, but not in something where we're trying to give you control of how it all works, relatively easily.<p>

It's open for discussion. The code that opens the databases is right there in startup.startupScript, ripe for improvement.
