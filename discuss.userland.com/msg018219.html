Cool.<p>

When this is done and stabilized, will it become the standard way that outlines are communicated via Pike?  I would really like that -- it would make it easier to deal with things like the little line-ending conversion I have to deal with in ZopeFish.<p>

It's the year 2000, and I still have to worry about the difference in line endings between Win32/Mac/Unix.  That really bites the wax tadpole.  Isn't it about time we fixed this?  I think standard XML document formats will go a long way towards this.<p>
