The Royal Society flourished because there was full disclosure: its "Philosophical Transactions" were the prototype of the modern scientific journal. There's always going to be a need for those who put in place the tools for collaboration, provide the conduits. Which is why Frontier and its surrounding technologies are a Good Thing.<p>
