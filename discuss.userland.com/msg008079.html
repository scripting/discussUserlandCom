Sometimes it's hard to know if a problem I'm seeing is one you know about, or perhaps if it's even just something about me/my browser, etc.<p>

I've occasionally had problems with Netscape Navigator being unable to display the tables on one or more of the hourly "New stories" pages, but I don't know if it's just me, or just a problem with Netscape Navigator, or a known problem with the "New stories" generator. I have been afraid to comment because I don't want to seem like a whiner or complainer, and I know it's all changing and in development, but if it really is a problem (and perhaps it only happens in the Unix version of Navigator, so you don't see it), you probably want to know.<p>

(BTW, I've had no display problems today, so if you've fixed something, thanks.)
