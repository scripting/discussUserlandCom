A few people have used it in the past, but right now only Jorn's using it.. Basically, the idea is that your weblog can be freeform, but inside the <A&gt; tag, you fill in the TITLE attribute... Then the title becomes the headline for that particular link... You could also specify the CLASS as being a "headline" if you wanted.. It's all perfectly valid and built into HTML.
