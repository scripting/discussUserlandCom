I write code all day long. I am a text person.  I cannot stand how the mouse on windows tracks.  If it bugs me like that, I can understand how it would be a showstopper for a pixel person.<p>

As an aside, my second machine is a PowerBook now.  The trackpad is alright - certainly better than the marble trackball on my old Duo, but if I sit down to do anything but answer email and check a few web sites with it, I have to plug in a mouse.  My reflexes just haven't adapted to the trackpad yet.  I'm not sure if they ever will.
