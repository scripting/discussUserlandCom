ok, maybe that's a good *direction* with all this noodling around with weblogs.com and such.  or at least a completely different and new offering that would tie lots of neat things together.<p>

<ol>
<li>free and easy weblog / site-hosting
<li>coolness of pike/manila editing
<li>favorites being the kicker... i mean, who <i>doesn't</i> like that?
<li>all neatly organized <b>especially</b> for those using mozilla/n6 in a *userland* tab that sits in the sidebar
<li>oh yeah... a <b>userland chrome!</b>
</ol><p>

of course, the same for non-mozilla users, but no sidebar [tho i'm sure microsoft will follow with an equivalent]<p>

the more i think about it, the more <b>the favorites thing</b> is the key... whether sidebar or not.  that kind of simplistic functionality is what people [like me anyway] have been thinking computers should do for us anyway!<p>

i hate sifting thru literally hundreds of bookmarks to find the site i want to visit, only to realize it's the same damn page i saw a few days ago when i get there!<p>

favorites rock<p>
