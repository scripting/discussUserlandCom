What we are seeing with Napster is a public response to policy. A significant population is saying to law enforcement, the legal system and the music industry that they do not want to be policed on this issue in the way the above groups desire. <p>

Once again, Napster is the marijuana of the 90s. <p>

I would, however, say that the public response to software <b>is</b> largely the same. <p>

Is MS deserving of the price that they want for a product that largely doesn't function as advertised? I find that often to be the case with Word for Mac. <p>

What should I buy instead? I have no options if I wish to remain a contributing member of the computing society. <p>

They are parallel arguments to what are being used for Napster. The action isn't justified, but the reasons are valid. It's a damn shame that so many institutions, rather than address the reasons, choose to hide their corporate raison d'etre behind an 8.5"x14" sheet of paper.
