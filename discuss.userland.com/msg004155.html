I don't think you can, at least not with the ISAPI plugins we distribute. You can try if you want, but there may be IIS 4-specific features in the plugin uses that prevent it from working correctly or at all with IIS 3.<p>

You can, of course, write your own IIS 3 ISAPI plugin that works with Frontier. I don't know of any reason that wouldn't be do-able.<p>

As I'm sure you already know, you can run Frontier itself as a webserver, even on the same box as IIS as long as you set IIS's and Frontier's ports to different numbers.
