If someone includes an RDF attribute in a doc design, it doesn't mean that one has to understand RDF just to use the attribute.<p>

RDF is not redundant with HTML.  While one can create a directed graph using *ML, you can't attach meanings to the links without some sort of common labeling of the links.  RDF is one way to label links with their reason for linking.<p>

So, while the vast majority of *ML users don't need to know what RDF is or how RDF works, what RDF <i>is</i> is a way to make explicit the meaning and relationship between elements so tools can be written to use those relationships (and hence, my vote for [a] foundation for The Semantic Web).
