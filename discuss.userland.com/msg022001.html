Not only have CPUs gotten faster and memory larger, but systems have gotten more reliable.<br><br>	At least <i>parts</i> of systems have gotten more reliable. I still have a fancy Dell laptop with a keyboard that doesn't work. But the hard disks don't crash as often. Knock wood, pray to Murphy.<br><br><b>Oh Lieberman, part III<a name="ohLiebermanPartIii">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/28#ohLiebermanPartIii" title="Permanent link to 'Oh Lieberman, part III' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Lots of (delayed) comments on my comment about Lieberman from <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/26">Sunday</a>. <br><br>	Yes I do hold Jews to a higher standard. Yes I liked Lieberman when he called Clinton on his lying about Lewinsky, because I thought maybe there were some responsible adults in Washington who didn't treat the electorate like stupid children. Now I think it was probably an opportunistic move, he's an astute politician, it got him the VP nomination. Good job Joe.<br><br>	Here's the scoop -- the election was a tie. It's impossible to know who got more votes. When you hear the Dems say they want to count every vote, know that they're spinning (lying). Can't do it. They're not stupid, and neither are we. Come on, this is Scripting News, we know about technology. When the disk crashes you don't worry about every last byte. You're lucky if you get the stuff that was never backed up. <br><br>	Now if Lieberman was a mensch he'd have begun his speech with the truth. "Dis election vas a tie. Now vat do ve do about it?" But he's not a mensch. He's just a politician. Oy. Life goes on.<br><br>
