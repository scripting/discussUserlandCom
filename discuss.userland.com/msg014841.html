I saw this on the tail end of this news.com article:

Quote from the article:

San Francisco start-up Invisible Worlds said it plans to appear before the Internet Engineering Task Force to propose standardization of its
     protocol for transporting XML data across the Web. <p>


     Invisible Worlds' "blocks" technology works for XML the way the Web's underlying HTTP (Hyptertext Transfer Protocol) works for HTML,
     said Carl Malamud, the company's chief executive. <p>


     "What we've developed is a standard way of getting XML back and forth," Malamud said in an interview. Malamud conceded that XML can
     travel via HTTP, but he said there is no consensus on how to do that. <p>


     Invisible Worlds will present its proposal at the task force's next three-times-yearly meeting, in March. News of its proposal was first
     reported by The Wall Street Journal. <p>

Malamud must not know about SOAP - he says "but he said there is no consensus on how to do that"
