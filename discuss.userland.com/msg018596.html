with the greatest possible interest I've read your prior (year-old) postings on CF techniques and now I'm happy that you're back in this DG. Have you actually implemented a (prototypical) ACF system?Or have you experience with systems like the ones from NetPerceptions? <p>

Small, rather focussed communities like this one centering around Scripting News might be an optimal playground for testing ACF concepts. Just, somebody has to start. In the long run, I plan to experiment with concept interrelation determination and visualization techniques in the context of <a href=http://www.langreiter.com/space/vanilla>Vanilla</a> - but really, in the <b>long</b> run. Some ideas are <i>sketched</i> at <a href=http://www.langreiter.com/space/vanilla-projects><a href="http://www.langreiter.com/space/vanilla-projects">http://www.langreiter.com/space/vanilla-projects</a></a>.<p>

A good start concerning CF in UserLand's DGs would be to allow to browse messages aggregated by author (or is this a feature I've looked over) - I mean, that's pretty essential.<p>
