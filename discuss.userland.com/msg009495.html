To quote from your DaveNet yesterday:<p>

<i>I received an email from an InfoWorld insider, a friend, who said that the policy is serious. My correspondent asked not to be identified, and I'm respecting that.</i><p>

This is pretty tacit approval of the fact that you're willing to accept email from people who ask not to be quoted; if it's not, and you're going to violate a pretty basic tenet of journalism, you should be pretty clear about this up front.  (Remember, you verified last year that you consider yourself a journalist, and in addition, you state today that this is a "scandal" that you're helping to expose.)<p>

Just my $0.02 -- and my guarantee that at least I'm going to be hesitant to help expose truths to the world through Scripting News...<p>
