How about a browser that is entirely based on a "watermark" approach -- controls that are see through?<p>

Also:  "built in" Winamp, real networks, quicktime, etc.  I don't care how big the client is -- I want best of breed functionality that works all the time.  <p>

I would also like the ability to kill buttons on the nav bar.  <p>

Fortunately, most of the advanced functionality is best done on the server side.
