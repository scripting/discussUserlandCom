I want the ability to Hoist a folder. There would be a balancing command, called De-Hoist. <p>

What Hoist does is push a stack. The item that the cursor is on becomes the universe. This allows me to focus my attention on just one folder. It would also be helpful when setting up a screen shot. <p>

We've had Hoist in our outliners since the mid-80s. Useful feature.
