This would punish the guilty, and not hurt the people who are creating patents for defensive purposes. Ultimately the lack of choice (if that's how the patent is used) costs the customers, so they're the ones who should make the biggest stink. The first thing to do is to get people to stop using "Patent Pending" as a selling point. It's disgusting.
