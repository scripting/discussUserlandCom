<i>"...and feature Quartz, a new graphics and windowing layer based on Adobe Systems Inc.'s Portable Document Format."</i><p>

Interesting. Sounds very much like the Display PostScript technology that the NeXT had (has?).<p>

<i>"Jobs announced that Apple's version of the OpenGL 3D API and Version 2.1.2 of its Mac OS Runtime for Java are available now from Apple's Web site."</i><p>

Very smart move, getting on top of OpenGL. This API is <i>very</i> important in the 3D game industry.<p>

As far as the MRJ goes, according to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/java/">website</a> the MRJ 2.1.2 is JDK 1.1.7 compliant. This is better than it's been in the past (1.0.x compliant). But at the same time, consider this: Java hit the 1.1.x mark over a year ago.<p>

JDK 1.2.1 is out now and the 1.2.x generation (called Java 2 by Sun) has been out and stable for months now.<p>

So, they're still behind on this and will probably remain so for some time after most of the world fully accepts Java 1.2.x<p>

Still, it's important to be up to 1.1.x at least. This is excellent news and really affects how much current Java software will run reliably on the Mac. i.e. A lot more now if this MRJ 2.1.2 is good.<p>

There was a BIG difference between 1.0.x and 1.1.x code, most notably in the event systems. There isn't nearly as much difference between 1.1.x and 1.2.x code. Until you get near RMI and security issues, at least. Not a big deal for a lot of desktop apps.
