ps: Since the image is providing a permanent link to the item described to the left of it, how about using a left-arrow? Still not perfectly intuitive (probably nothing would be), but it would fit in nicely with the rest of the QBullets logic.<p>

pps: Communicator doesn't like the anchor names either. The leading "#" needs to be removed from the anchor name.
