"My WAP phone started to crash every time I accessed the WML rendering of SpicyNoodles." <p>

We have a WAP <a href="http://dave.editthispage.com/xml/default.wml">channel</a> on EditThisPage.Com. I'll be editing it with Manila on my laptop. <p>

Administrative note. We changed EditThisPage.Com so that it runs its overnight tasks at 2AM Pacific instead of 11PM Pacific. <p>

Andre did a <a href="http://spicynoodles.com/pictures/viewer$20">screen shot</a> of my channel as rendered on a WAP phone. We-Do-Wap could be the chorus of a Beach Boys song. Remember the Beach Boys? <i><a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~CYBERSTACKS/calgirls.wav">I do!</a></i><p>

Paul Krugman: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/opinion/krugman/012300krug.html">The Magic Mountain</a>. "The scene at Davos -- the superrich and their trophy wives schmoozing with officials elected and appointed, the lavish parties thrown by third-world nations, and so on -- represents a sort of distilled essence of everything that people love to hate about the New World Order. Those on both left and right who view globalization as a sort of conspiracy by rootless cosmopolitans against the rest of us could hardly have asked for a better spectacle."<p>

My plane for Zurich leaves at 4PM Tuesday, but I'm experiencing last minute <a href="http://www.davosnewbies.com/stories/storyReader$322">panic</a> now.<p>

I did a <a href="http://search.excite.com/search.gw?callerfarm=nt&collection=hourtime&search=davos">search</a> for "Davos" on Excite and came up with this <a href="http://news.excite.com/news/pr/000117/nortel-world-forum">press release</a> from Nortel Networks that says they're wiring up Davos! Gotta check this out.<p>
