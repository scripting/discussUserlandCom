He's only talking about what you published on your site. All of that is in the search engine too. He didnt write about things you could have said but didn't. I think Bryce's summary is pretty accurate, except for the exaggaration -- you didn't mail-bomb the CEO of Conxion, you just sent him email as a concerned customer -- your right by any measure. Maybe one email per outtage is a bit extreme though.<p>

Isnt this an opportunity to simplify your world? Your network did look a bit complex for what you're trying to do, according to your <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$529">whiteboard picture</a>. Why have three parties involved in providing your access -- PacBell, Conxion and whoever PacBell uses (I think it's IBM GlobalNet) to get to the Internet? I'd switch to pure PacBell for both ISP and T1 provider.<p>

I'm curious -- is there anything in their business contract about defamation? Is there anything in there about compensation for outtages?
