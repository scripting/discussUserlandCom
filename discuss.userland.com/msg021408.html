At the risk of sounding pushy, let me ask when might we expect to see it.<p>

IMHO, opening up plug-ins to allow developers as much control as possible would be an excellent direction to take. Obviously, there's no way for Userland to build Manila out-of-the-box to do everything one would want to do with it.  Nevertheless, there are ways in which the core of Manila can be improved without necessitating a plug-in -- and that would be an area about which many Manila users would have somethings to say.<p>

Knowing how we can offer constructive input in that area and being able to see whether the ideas are being incorporated would go a long way to building a community of Manila developers and users.   Right now, it's unclear to me how to offer such input and know that it's being taken seriously:  post in Manila-newbies?  on the Frontier-Users?  do it yourself by rewriting Manila?<p>

I now appreciate that work on Radio Userland furthers your work on Manila -- but it certainly wasn't at all obvious to me that this was so when you first announced RU.  (I kept wondering what music had to do with Manila.  I now think of RU as a platform closer to the client-end that lets end-users manipulate and exchange XML data with song lists being a first (and currently) primary example.  I'm likely to be incorrect here since I'm still learning about RU.)<p>

About how nice it is to edit a Manila site (or weblog) in an outline:  you don't have to convince me.  I'm a die-hard fan/user of Ecco that is dabbling with how to <A HREF="http://ecco.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$18">shoehorn XML, XML-RPC, etc into Ecco</A> so that I can edit my Manila site with this PIM/Outliner.  However, as much as a small number of people love outliners, I'm not convinced that many people I hope to convince to write for the web would take to outliners -- just my hunch at this point.  If they don't like outliners, then what?  (I've started to think about trying to wire up MS-Word or XMetal 2.0 to speak XML-RPC so that users of those products can edit Manila sites. Does anyone know of work in that area?)
