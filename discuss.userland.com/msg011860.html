I just receieved a bug report from a user of our dynamically-generated RSS file, which is generated by a JavaScript ASP. The problem is that things that should be HTML entities (like a bare ampersand) aren't converted into the proper entity encoding (&amp;).<p>

I have several PERL scripts which generate XML files, and I do the encoding with the HTML::Entities module, passing everything through the encode_entities() and decode_entities() functions before writing the XML. I'm wondering if anyone has a similar set of JavaScript functions that they could point me to. I'm rushed for time and don't have the time to write 'em myself, so I was hoping someone might have just the tool that I need.<p>

So, does anyone have some pre-fab functions that they'd be willing to point me to? I would be most appreciative.<p>

Thanks, all!
