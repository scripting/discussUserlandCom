Bush said no way, Florida is too close. They took it back. Later they called it for Bush. By that time it was the margin, the candidate who would win Florida would win the presidency. Gore calls Bush to concede. A Florida vote counter calls Gore while he's on his way to give his concession speech. "Wait a minute Al, it's not over yet." Gore calls Bush and says "Dubya, I changed my mind." Less than 2,000 votes separate the two in Florida. We await a recount. <i>What a mess!</i><br><br><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/questionMark.gif" height="45" width="35" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="8" align="left">How did the networks <u>all</u> get it wrong in Florida <u>twice</u>? Just listened to PBS's News Hour; they interviewed <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Warren+Mitofsky&btnG=Google+Search">Warren Mitofsky</a>, the statistician who advised CNN and CBS on their projections last night. The networks pool a lot of resources. We have so much faith in their projections. It seems safe to assume that in the future we won't believe these reports so readily, and let's look to the networks to separate their processes. What will the statisticians learn from the experience of making two mistakes in one race? Could it possibly have been more confusing?
