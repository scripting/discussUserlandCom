I'm really impressed with your recent demo sites (MTTF, whois, the discussion group). It looks like Frontier is shaping up nicely since the days of ClayBasket and 4.0, and I wish you lots of luck with 6.0.<p>

Are you still interested in forging links between Frontier and Unix servers? I know a little bit about the Unix side of this equation (see my personal info for details) and I know lots of really savvy Frontier users up at Dartmouth College<p>

This is a friendly offer--I used Frontier 4 back in my Macintosh days, and feel I still owe you a tiny bit. If you're not interested, I certainly won't bug you about this. ;-)
