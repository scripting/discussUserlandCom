That way you hand off the name of the song as late as you can before the previous song completes and it'll start playing immediately, without you having to poll it every second or more. You use the MP3 player's playlist as a short-term cache to handle the transition. <p>

Keep in mind that a huge complaint about SoundJam for a while was that it inserted about a 1/10th second delay between tracks which disrupted play for songs which transition through track segments. Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' is a good example. It's pretty close to one big song, broken up into individual tracks.<p>

The timing can be streamlined by asking for the length of the track as soon as you hand it off and then polling infrequently (every 15 seconds or more) up until a few seconds before the track is scheduled to complete at which time you pick up the pace. Would there really be any harm in committing the next track say, up to 3 seconds before the previous one is done? It'd make coding much easier, I think, and much improve the quality of the result.
