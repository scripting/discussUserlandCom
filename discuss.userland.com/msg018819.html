MS can't even make a SOAP implimentation that works to spec(and they helped write the spec).  They refuse to make IE conform to HTML standards(I don't mind adding extras, but work to spec first).  <p>

You might say that .NET isn't necessarily a MS thing, but it is.  They control all the major pieces of it.  You can go ahead and tout its openess, just like MS does, but most interactions with .NET will only be useful in relation to the services MS will provide on it.  The truely savvy could break off and do their own thing.  But 99% of the users of .NET will be either talking from or to an MS product, and this will give MS defacto control over every aspect of .NET.<p>

It is classic embrace and extend, why should OSS people get excited?
