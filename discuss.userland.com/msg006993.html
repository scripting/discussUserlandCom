I had to go back to the scripting news web site, click on the cow skull, and then check through the topics to see if anyone had written anything already.<p>

This seems counterintuitive.<p>

All the pieces are there, but they need to be closer together. How about this, Dave: every time you write a Davenet piece, have Frontier start a new thread automatically and link to it at the bottom of the piece. That saves me a lot of clicks and page renderings (still pretty slow in Netscape 4 mac) and makes it easy for readers to write feedback and read that of others. Plus it's in <b>context</b>.<p>

I have also noticed that there is a topic generated for each day's scripting news outline. Is there any reason you couldn't put a link to this in the header for each day's news? You can only benefit from this kind of contextual links.<p>

For a more complete version of the ideas behind this, please take a second look at <a href=http://www.windseye.com/Dru/fip>fip</a>. It seems to be exactly what you've been talking about in terms of collaborative writing, and talks about context, too.<p>

cheers!<p>
