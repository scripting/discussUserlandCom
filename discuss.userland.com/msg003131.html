In fact, in many of these facilities they call the person who interactes with the technology the technographer. <p>

These systems have not had much success yet because most of them exist within a corporate climate that does not truly support or reward collaboration.<p>

They are also designed for meetings that are not actually consensus-driven, and though they provide results, they are generally used to support meetings that are not specifically result-oriented. They make great use of voting, for example, but voting does not produce consensus, though, in the right setting, it informs the consensus.<p>

I make it key in my definition of technography that these two aspects. are what technography is there to enable: consensus and results.
