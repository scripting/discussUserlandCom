I don't think there's good reason to be scared of namespaces either once you see how it works.<p>

Here's the facts:
<li>People want to extend RSS. 
<li>If you stick elements in RSS that aren't in the spec, it's no longer RSS (which is ok as long as the people using it know about the extra elements).
<li>Namespaces are an easy way to import elements that are not in the RSS spec (legally). i.e. Slashdot:category <p>

The benefit of using namespaces is that you can distribute an RSS file with the new element, i.e. Slashdot:category, and the namespace element is simply ignored if the parser doesn't know what to do with it. This is essentially the same method Dave mentioned earlier, except that the namespace method will still be valid RSS.<p>

What do you think Dave?
