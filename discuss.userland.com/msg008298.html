<i>I have a couple of items here in this message. First, [assuming no-one else has extended an invite] consider yourself invited to tonight's SVLUG meeting in San Jose. With LinuxWorld just around the corner, this ought to prove to be a high-energy meeting. (www.svlug.org for directions)</i><p>

Wish I could be there!<p>

<i>That sentence indicates that you believe that *if* MS released a server OS that was price and feature competitive with Linux, that it would somehow be preferable to use it rather than an open source alternative. Think about it; that'll never be true.</i><p>

Don't look at these things as an either/or proposition. UserLand supports Windows and the MacOS, and we're starting to get into Linux. Our tools hook up to as many environments as possible.<p>

Lots of intelligent people use Windows for lots of good reasons. Sometimes, the Linux community forgets that. Fortunately, we've got some good documents to remind us how to be polite:<p>

Remember: never tell somebody his or her tools are stupid.<p>

Cheers,<br>
