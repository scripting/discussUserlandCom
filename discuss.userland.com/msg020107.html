Code was traded through users groups and later over the internet (back before commercialization when it was primarily only universities and research institutions that had access - I used to be able to name all the machines on the internet - there were only something like 20).  It was all in the spririt of research and development and we were all helping each other.  This has never stopped in some circles - other open source people were people who got burned when something they used to have acess to was commercialized and they lost something to someone else's greed.  No wonder they're pissed about commercialization.
