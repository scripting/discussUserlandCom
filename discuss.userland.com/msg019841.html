Wasn't that demonstrated at the trial? Didn't this argument get raised by the defendants?</i><p>

The defendents did point this out (quite often, in fact). The judge didn't seem to pay much attention. I really don't understand what happened in that court room.<p>

<i>By the way, is there a DVD player for Linux that demonstrates this fair non-infringing use based on the DeCSS code? That would make the argument that much stronger, wouldn't it?</i><p>

You can find a Linux DVD player on the LiViD website:<p>

<a href="http://www.linuxvideo.org/"><a href="http://www.linuxvideo.org/">http://www.linuxvideo.org/</a></a><p>

As far as I can tell, DeCSS was actually written as a donation to this project. And some of the LiViD developers appear to be defendents in the lawsuit itself.<p>

Cheers,<br>
