I'm seeing Eric Raymond speak tonight, and I wanted it fresh in my mind.  I've been giving the open-source movement a lot of thought lately, as I'm sure most software developers have.  And I still have a lot of unanswered questions, as I'm sure many people do.  I hope I get a chance to ask some of these questions tonight.<p>

In reading, I've come up with a thought.  Something about this all reminds me of rich people and Taxes. <sarcasm>As we all know, rich people shouldn't have to pay taxes.</sarcasm>  Why? because rich people are making those decisions.  What do you think they will decide?  "should we pay taxes, or be supported by the unwashed masses?", duh.  From a UNIX point of view, "should we pay for software, or be supported by the unlearned masses?". duh.  "Free software. Pay for service." is a great model for programmers seeing that they don't necessarily need the service.  Then again, maybe I'm totally off base here.<p>

I am not against the open source movement.  I have a big spot in my heart for new ways of thinking.  Then again, I also have a big spot in my heart for feeding my family.  I know that open-source people love to jump on this: "Open source doesn't mean there is no money".  I really want to find out more about this.  What are they talking about?  I wish I could sit down and talk with someone that felt like they had a grasp on meeting the necessities of life <i>and</i> giving away software; To really talk with them, not have them preach to me; To talk like friends, and help me work it all out.<p>

Why did I write this?  It's just rambling.  Guess I'll post it anyway.  Why do I talk to myself like that?  I don't know, I just do.
