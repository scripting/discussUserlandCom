Poorly formed XML text, we were expecting a </BODY> tag. (At character #314.)<p>

A </body> tag? I didn't know there were such things. The file is at <a href="http://interactfiction.about.com/library/news/ifnews.rss">http://interactfiction.about.com/library/news/ifnews.rss</a>. Any help would be much appreciated.<p>

Thanks,<p>
