Unfortunately, putting the BeOS framework on Linux would require ripping out enough of Linux that the remaining parts are small enough that you might as well rewrite them too, and you end up with BeOS again. That makes me ask "Why not just use BeOS?" The only real downsides seem to be lack of customizability and limited processor support.<p>

The GNOME and KDE projects are trying to build good application frameworks for Linux, but in my experience many of the developers value their own opinions more than usability research. I think they're looking for usability help; it doesn't pay and previous people who have tried to do it gave up after their mailboxes filled up with flames, but the work is extremely satisfying. :-)
