Heh.<p>

While Frontier has all the parts and pieces of an OS (file-system-like databases, application-like frameworks and suites, etc.) it also has the synergy of all of it's pieces working together that create an environment.  <p>

<ol>
<li>The environment is rich and deep.  Plenty of room to play here without switching out of Frontier.  The magic for me is working on Win NT, where I am still a newbie, and just maximizing the Frontier MDI; I'm totally at home.</li><p>

<li>And the environment is extensible--similar to PhotoShop and Quark, but with a much lower entry threshhold.  I don't think I'll ever be able to write a Photoshop plugin, but it's pretty easy to create my own suite or mini-app inside of Frontier. </li><p>

<li>Finally, the environment is self-aware, and also aware of other environments.  It was built to work with other apps and OS's; not to try to do everything it's own way.  In fact, a good portion of Frontier's functionality is all about talking to other environments--look at how many file verbs there are.</li>
</ol><p>

These basic concepts are what make Frontier unique--and uniquely capable of handling whatever task you throw at it.
