Well, there <i>used</i> to a differnce between applications and libraries. :-) Up until about 1990, or so, the distinction made sense.<p>

An application was a stand-alone tool, written for users. A library was a modular component, written for developers. Of course, the arrival of component software changed everything.<p>

Here's a handy rule of thumb: You can always ask a developer what his or her license means. And if you think the developer is smoking crack, you can ask your lawyer.<p>

Up until the DeCSS & MP3 cases, I would have said that licenses were restrained by fair use, contract law, and the Consitution. But it's increasingly apparent that certain judges don't care.<p>

These days, you challenge a license at your own risk. So maybe it's best to talk to the author instead.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
