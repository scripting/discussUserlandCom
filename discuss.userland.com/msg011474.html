(For the record, I don't reject it.)<p>

Here's a thought: Is there any way to inspect a encrypted transaction and determine the strength of the transaction without attempting to actually break it?  (Intuition suggest no, but I can't prove it, which is a big thing in encryption "qbullet.smiley".)  <p>

Anyhow, if the answer is no, as I suspect, then they can't catch the people breaking the "encryption strength law" anyhow until they're under suspicion for something else.  I haven't got a conclusion for this observation, but surely this means something.<p>

Anyhow, it will be very difficult to enforce this, so I imagine that we'll be seeing some sort of concerted campaign to convince people that Only Criminals Need Encryption.  Will there be a concerted effort to counteract that?
