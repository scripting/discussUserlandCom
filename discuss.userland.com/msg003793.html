For people who aren't familiar with the Quake game history. Quake2 is a Win32 game. But for network play it uses a copy of the game running in dedicated server mode.<p>

Zoid is a sole individual who works primarily in Unix/Linux. He was hired by id as a consultant and performed the conversion of the Quake server code to Linux. It was a very successful project. All the online servers that I know of are running on Zoid's code.
