User-controlled design is the concept of designing a web site that gives the end user maximum control over how a page will render in their browser.<p>

I recently implemented a pretty cool little feature on my <A HREF="http://www.camworld.com/">web site</A> that allows my readers to choose whatever [predefined by the designer] colorscheme they want. This does a few things:<p>

1. It allows the user to choose. A good thing.
2. It helps those who have trouble reading certain text color/background color combinations.<p>

Rogers is right that the web designer never is in complete control of a web site design, and rightly, never should be. Browser preferences (background color, font settigns, etc.) are there for a reason. By over-riding these user-specified settings with HTML and CSS, you are breaking a crucial rule of usability. <p>

Give the control back to the user.
