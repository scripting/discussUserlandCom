Every message that's posted here stays in the database for perpetuity, and hastens the day when we have to recode the software so it scales to handle larger databases. Further every new message is saved in XML, and backed up every night. It strains our systems to have more vaccuous messages. I agree that Brett is absusing his welcome here. On the other hand, every time he does it, he gets a rebuttal, so other people are helping. As always it takes two to tango. And there's a bright side, even though I'm not learning much from Brett's repeated postings of the same ideas, there are new adversaries showing up every day and they are getting successively more interesting. It makes me think that perhas Brett should have his own show.
