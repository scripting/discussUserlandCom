<i>Does your site use GIFs? Then Unisys says you owe them some money; possibly a lot of money.</i><p>

Did I mention that I think software patents are silly? :-)<p>

More to the point, the Unisys patent covers LZW compression (and possibly decompression, though there's some disagreement on this subject). A web server neither compresses nor decompresses GIFs. It merely transmits them across the network.<p>

Now, I am not a lawyer, but I don't think the Unisys patent covers transmission of LZW-compressed data. Somehow, I doubt Unisys has a leg to stand on in this case.<p>

(I'm going to look up their patent and post a link here in a minute.)<p>

Cheers,<br>
