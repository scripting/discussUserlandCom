Look what happened to DOS.  For most of the 80's, it had a fairly poor
interface.  It was so bad that the number of homes who had a DOS-based
PC was relatively low.  Non-intuitive and all the rest of that good stuff.<p>

Of course, during much of the same time, Apple was pretty strong.
They didn't have the same software-only strategy that Microsoft did,
but they managed to do pretty well by selling an easy-to-use
package.<p>

Along came Windows 95.  W95, along with the availabity of relativly
inexpensive hardware and the growing popularity of the Internet, made
DOS really take off.  People didn't have to see (as much of) the
command line as they did before W95, and they were much happier.<p>

If DOS can hide its ugly face, why can't Linux?  These players have
the economic incentive to do it.<p>

Mark.
