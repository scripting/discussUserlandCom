I keep thinking the only solution to firewalls, if not to change them and the policies that surround them (an enormous barrier), is to degrade a version of XML-RPC to work within that one-way world. <p>

Firewall admins are part of the IT Security Complex, justifying budgets through formal risk management means and gut level "Hackers and viruses are at the gates" fears. More than one client maker has crashed headlong into it. PointCast, for one. <p>

If the enterprise audience is important to Manila/Pike, both with personal weblogging and vocational, then adapting the protocol may be a way in the door.
