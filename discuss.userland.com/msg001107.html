Let's get beyond the idea of web browsers as *browsers*! The current Mosaic-based model of a web browser is well suited for looking at static sites, but clumsy as a web app client.<p>

Maybe we ARE stuck with the "forms" standard as the only good way to interact with a web app server. If so, browser implementations of forms interfaces could certainly be improved (e.g. Dave's desire for better text-editing capabilities). And hopefully, better standards will arise.<p>

Just a thought: build a browser with additional "application interface" elements which can communicate with an app server via an XML-RPC standard. Sidestep HTML's limitations entirely!<p>

IMVHO, of course.<p>
