I am a Data Base Specialist II. I work with perl and mySQL for most of our big projects.<p>

I have been doing some simple cgi scripts for our webteam. Our main web server is an powermac 7600, soon to be a new G3 400. (<a href="http://www.kern.org/">http://www.kern.org/</a>)<p>

We are planning to have our entire site managed by Frontier 6.0. We need the most basic site management functions, and the webteam is excited about the possibility of having users post updates to sections of their websites themselves, via web or e-mail interfaces. We are also planning a Frontier based discussion area. <p>

At home I use 4.2 with some clay-basket like stuff to build slide shows for my kid's web pages (<a href="http://www.clerico.com/tucker/">http://www.clerico.com/tucker/</a> and <a href="http://www.clerico.com/courtney/">http://www.clerico.com/courtney/</a> --click on snow pics or robot pics). My current version uses comments stored with each file in the finder to add captions.<p>

My biggest project outside of work, with Frontier 4.2, is a file-uploading, e-commerce site. It basicaly organizes files that have been uploaded via http to our server into a shopping cart with items that can be ordered for each item that has been uploaded. The next phase will be a shopping cart metaphor for files uploaded via FTP sessions. I am trying to convince this client to upgrade to the basic commercial 6.0. This would be an interesting transition. (<a href="http://www.pictureprint.com">http://www.pictureprint.com</a>)<p>

I am pitching another prospective client for an new Frontier based, e-commerce site. I'll keep you posted...<p>
