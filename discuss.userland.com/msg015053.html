Design is about making things work for people. The stuff he's done before is just pretty-to-look at, so who cares, it's not worth commenting on. But now he's in a different realm. He's trying to make stuff that's worth using, a whole different ballgame.<p>

I used him as a foil to expose some issues that smart designers, the real kind, should be thinking about now. If he wants to pay attention he can do much better. But I was critiquing for my readers, pay attention guys and gals, see where we came from?<p>

Part of the process of moving forward is giving up the bullshit that he (and others) take so much pride in. Standardized UIs are coming for the web. I am sure of that. <p>

Now, about you, Jeff Cambell, stop trying to edit me. Your last paragraph is disgusting. Have you been listening?
