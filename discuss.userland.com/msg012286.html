Because of the lost-update problem, PUT was never implemented very much (that I know of). It would be interesting for someone to set up a server that actually sends a 301 in response to a PUT request and see what Netscape Composer and FrontPage do. Do they work? Do they choke? I have no idea.<p>

This brings up an interesting point: The editable Web still isn't here after years of work. HTTP PUT was flawed because it has no locking, so people started on WebDAV. WebDAV is here (sorta), although I don't get a good feeling when I read all the questions about the spec on the mailing list.<p>

Looking specifically at Dave's Web hosting proposal, I don't really see any benefit of switching to HTTP PUT if there aren't any clients or servers that implement PUT well enough.
