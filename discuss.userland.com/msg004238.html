On the other hand, if they compared Apache on OS X against IIS on NT, they would be comparing 4 different beasts with no common factors. How do you tell whether it is IIS beats Apache, NT beats OS X server, or vice versa?<p>

On the other hand, I also think that a Web benchmarks is not a very reliable measure. Anyone knows how they measure it? Nowadays, a lot of websites are actually a web application. The OS runs more than just the webserver, but also a bunch of other apps, cgis, and/or databases. I would doubt that the cooperative Mac OS (w/ WebTen) can still perform better the OS X server under such environment.
