A rack, KVM (keyboard, video, monitor) switch, monitor, keyboard and mouse can easily set you back $1.5-3K for a 6-8 system configuration. UPSs will set you back another $100-200 per box.<p>

The rest depends on what you're going to do with the boxes, and what your priorities are. Are your disk capacity and availability needs met by having a single drive in each machine, or do you need something fancier, like a RAID configuration with hot-swap capabilities?<p>
