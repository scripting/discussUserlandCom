Well, messing with the builtins is not such a big deal, if you're careful.  I don't advise it if you don't understand what is happening, but if you do, and you need the features, go for it. And there's an uninstaller...<p>

Of course, I take no responsibility for what happens ;-)<p>

Remember the version 4.2.3 days, when we regularly changed suites.html? Those were the days.<p>

Maybe I'm more comfortable with changing the builtins, because japanese functionality in Frontier requires extensive mods to builtins.html as well as builtins.string.<p>

Also, it's probably good for people to try this and see if their macros break.  I think I did it in a way that will minimize the damage, but I could have missed something.  So it's probably a good idea for it to get wider burn-in before it goes into the official distribution.<p>

Cheers, Phil
