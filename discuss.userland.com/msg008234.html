I think the current http post format is good enough to pass as a mime message. With additional headers (to,from,subject), it could pass as a legal email message. The only necessary mapping would be post path <=> subject?<p>


<i> issues of security and privacy can likewise build upon E-mail standards</i><p>

Pardon my saying so, but there are is _no_ email standard security. <p>

There are mime types that include signed/encrypted content, but the headers are never encrypted. There is not even a reliable mechanisim for the sender to determine if a particular message arrived at the recipient.  Http is much better in this regard. If the connection breaks before the response is read, then the request failed.<p>

IMnsHO he issue of privacy and security would be better dealt with within the XML-RPC spec, independent of transport type.  Perhaps one could encapsulate the XML-RPC request as a decrypt(contents) call on the reciever, with the decrypt function then calling whichever function is in the payload of the message. This is extensible to signing/authentication and backwards compatible with the original non-encrypted XML-RPC method.<p>
