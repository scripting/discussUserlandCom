  Discuss. There are X replies to this message.<p>

  Where 'Discuss' takes you to the first reply. This is how I had it before I switched to Manila. I like it because it gives me an incentive to click over from news to discussion mode.<p>

2) Allow IE5 (and higher) users to edit with a rich text editor by using an IFRAME with designMode="On". Add a hidden TEXTAREA and then copy the contents of the IFRAME onClick() on the "post response" button. This is easy to implement, I have done it but I no longer have a demo, since I upgraded to Manila (which has other great features!). A demo of designMode itself is at <a href="http://cajal.mbb.ki.se/staff/sten">http://cajal.mbb.ki.se/staff/sten</a>. Requires IE5 (not 5.5).<p>

3) List the whole topic below each message in flat mode, with a pointer to the current message. Like this:<p>

  A message<br>
  A reply<br>
  Another reply<br>
>>This is what we're reading now<br>
  Another message<br><p>

Could work in threaded mode too, but I prefer flat so I can just read through in chronological order.<p>

<p>

...this is what I like. I have implemented it in Frontier 6.0, and I'm just about to move it to Manila. <p>

Question: how can I prevent the automatic update from overwriting my customizations? Is there an easy way to both get the Userland updates and bugfixes <b>and</b> customize the editor, the message board etc? Or should I just wait for Userland to add the features?
