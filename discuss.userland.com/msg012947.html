I really like where this is going. The <description> part is the one remaining issue I have with RSS.  What I'd like to see there is an attribute on the description that says it's in HTML, and allows links to multiple pages from one <item>. Then we could retire <scriptingNews> format to a legacy format. That's the one remaining thing it does that RSS doesn't.
