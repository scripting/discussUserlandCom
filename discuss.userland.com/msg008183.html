However, in the process of moving their archives into their new templates, it's created a visual mess of text that has no breaks and seems to flow on and on and on...<p>

It's impossible to imagine anyone that would be able to get past a few sentences without getting an immense knot in their brain.<p>

Sure there are more ideal solutions to address <A HREF="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html" TITLE="Jakob Nielsen Alertbox from October 1997">how people read on the Web</A>. But until that happens, please bring back some breaks in the text.<p>

<B>Amazon.Com makes their share of mistakes, but they win with usability as their primary focus</B>
<BR>
Jakob Nielsen was quoted in an article in tomorrow's Arizona Republic:<p>

"The reason why some sites get famous, like Amazon.com, is that they make usability the primary focus. What makes it easy for people to buy a book or CD?" Nielsen said. "They are not geniuses. I've noticed them doing stupid things. But if they make a mistake, they fix it immediately. They know what works and what doesn't work."<p>
