For the most part it's simply stuff of interest to us as Windows developers, but I also link to things that we should pay attention to (eg growing interest and acceptance of Linux as a mainstream OS), and sometimes just purely fun and silly things.<p>

It's efficient in that people don't need to go searching for things they should be keeping up with, unless it's something very specific to their interests.<p>
