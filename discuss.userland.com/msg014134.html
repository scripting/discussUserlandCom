.1: application service providing (ASP) means big business<p>

.2: compared to Manila iTools is pretty lame. in many aspects iTools delievers very few functionality ( Mail, iDisk, KidSafe, oversimplified HomePage-Builder). also iCards are not that hot.maybe this is the price for big usernumbers. because of the expected high usertraffic the services are  obviously unixbased. ( yes i am waiting hard for a unix-based frontier-server). the more people you want to reach the more stupid your services have to be. ( very similar to tv)<p>

.3: the visual appeal counts. concerning this i am convinced manila-services would benefit a lot from beeing available with several different but welldesigned themes to choose from. <p>

.4: Obviously iTools targets similar usergroups compared to  Manila as an ASP-product. Interesting times that raise one question: Is there an opportunity for Manila / Frontier / Userland to participate in Apples Internet Strategy? And when how can this be done the most efficient way ?<p>

.5: Finally what is this all about: big easy--->
Hybrid Interactive Publishing Models for Family Home Entertainment or better the Web for the Rest of Us.<p>
