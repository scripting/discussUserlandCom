You have to have a fulltime net connection if you want people from outside your LAN to have access. If all you want to do is to test it on your LAN, no problem, just do it, it doesn't matter if the ISDN line is up or down.<p>

In other words, it isn't really a Frontier question, it's a networking question. If what you want to do is keep the ISDN line open, just install a scheduled <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1436">everyMinute script</a> that reads a small page or graphic from some known web server that's not on your LAN. The key Frontier verb for this is <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/tcp/httpclient">tcp.httpClient</a>.<p>

<b>Summary</b><p>

If you put this script at user.scheduler.everyMinute.keepIsdnOpen:<p>

<pre>tcp.httpclient (server:"www.scripting.com", path:"space.gif")</pre><p>

That should do it.<p>

(You might want to pick a server that's closer to home!)
