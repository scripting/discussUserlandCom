Limited participation -- 100 people. Developers only, no press. UserLand will host this meeting, in cooperation with IBM and O'Reilly. We'll have a new website open tomorrow with more information. <i>T-shirt included at no extra cost.</i> ";->"<br><br>Frontier: <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$3514">html.refGlossary callback</a>.<br><br>Social Ecology: <a href="http://www.socialecology.com/frontier/pikechat.html">ManilaPalooza Chat Transcript</a>.<br><br><a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com/2000/03/28">NetDyslexia</a>: "Most of the NetDyslectics were born in a socialist country: in the G.D.R.

"I recently signed this clause in a 3 page NDA by a startup company that consisted of exactly two founders, and no employees.

Let me make an exception. Today I am wiped out. More tired than I remember ever being. The outages, the Pike shipment, ManilaPalooza, new business, and some self-centered would-be software architects. Please let up on the redesigns. There's a lot of thought and permutation, blind alleys and retooling that went into Pike. Software design is highly skilled work and doesn't happen quickly. It's OK to poke at Pike, discover how it works, ask questions, but save the redesigns for when you understand more about what you got. We've been working on permutations of this software for two years. I strongly believe this is the one that works best. (Or we wouldn't have shipped it.)<br><br>2/9/98: <a href="http://www.scripting.com/98/02/stories/masonHaleOnWorkingWithMe.html">Mason on Working With Dave</a>.<br><br>I've been saying this for quite a while.

Four pages of docs -- an <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/manila/staticRendering/">overview</a> with instructions for Manila MEs, a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/manila/staticRendering/serverSetup">howto</a> for server managers, a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/manila/staticRendering/caseStudy">case study</a>, and a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/manila/staticRendering/developersGuide">guide</a> for people who want to customize their static renderings. <br><br>After much discussion and a demo about static rendering at ManilaPalooza on Saturday, we decided to release it first to Frontier developers so they can have static rendering for their Manila sites. Used in this mode, Manila becomes a multi-user staging server. Very powerful combination. <br><br>It's going to be difficult to transition individual ETP sites to static rendering without link breakage. We're going to start with some of the high-flow sites, like Matt Garland's music site. Each site will teach us something. However it's easy for *new* sites. So we may open an all-static hosting server on UserLand.Com. Still puzzling this out.<br><br><a href="http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-523.html#lnk3">Adam Engst</a> reviews MSIE5/Mac. <br><br>Breakage fixed.
