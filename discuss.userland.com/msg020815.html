Which leads to the first question...<p>

Where in the world would I locate if I wanted to set up a business that managed personal information? What country would provide the most powerful and secure means for defending a person's privacy, even to extremes? <p>

Which leads to the second question...<p>

I almost want a data haven.<p>
