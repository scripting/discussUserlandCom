	Naw. You're right about the visual, eh? I keep a drawing - gel ink on a yellow 3x5 card - on my desk. I made it in pre-dawn light and signed it upside down and backwards. It became a spark in a response in design class last semester. <p>

	For next semester I'm keeping a jade plant frag on my desk. It follows the sun, branching near-randomly in a heliotropic pattern. The next layer would be to photograph it often enough that it would be like the old time-lapse stuff. Then turn it. Then watch as it runs out of self to support itself (no roots, no soil, just the wood of the desk) as it becomes a rather low grade sort of wood itself. <p>

	But you know, at the first drop of water . . .
