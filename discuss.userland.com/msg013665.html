My company's client platform is Mac however and I need to find some way to create a dial system from a web page that will talk to an iMac modem and dial a number from a field on the page. Does anyone know of a way to do this with AppleScript(or anything else for that matter)? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm also willing to help if someone has a problem related to any of my fields of knowledge.<p>

Thanx
