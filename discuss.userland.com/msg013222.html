I've not heard of a published DTD for calendering, but I've heard many mentions of them in some projects or lists (mostly xml-dev and comp.text.xml).<p>

There is a XML version of vCard (contact info) as an Internet Draft.  I read once on their site that they were also intending to XMLize vCalender (the calender, event, and notification info), but I haven't seen the results.  You may want to take a look at vCalendar anyway, even though it's not in XML yet.  Most simple calendar events are in the 5 to 20 line range, complex events grow from there.  vCard and vCalendar info is available at <<a href="http://www.imc.org/pdi/">http://www.imc.org/pdi/</a>>
