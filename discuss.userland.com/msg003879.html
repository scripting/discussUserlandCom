We invariably become limited to using functionality that's only in the runtime. <p>

<b>We want to build on all the functionality that's in Frontier. </b><p>

Development is about choice, and that's the choice we think works best. <p>

Frontier is Frontier, not sliced into pieces and deployed differently in different places.<p>

<b>On the other hand</b><p>

That said, it's not a sure thing that we will never nail this one. Part of the maturation of the server-side in Frontier 6 may be the identification of a subset that would make a good runtime. But first we need a good ship, a good deploy and a relatively long burn-in on customer's systems.<p>

See how difficult it is to talk about this? You never know what's coming next.
