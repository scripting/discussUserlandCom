It's not always true, but it is a lot of the time.  We wouldn't have all the interesting features in Mozilla if Microsoft and Netscape hadn't been pushing each other.  If there's no competition, innovation isn't as important.<p>

Unless, of course, you're innovating for the sake of innovating.  This is not a profit motive, so you'll see it less in the corporate model.  It's more common in the open source model.  (This is *not* a rant about how open source is better, it's an observation.)  And even in open source, competition drives people... it's just a different form of competition.  Ego is a powerful motivator.  perl developed so many features between perl 4 and perl 5 because the developers badly wanted to stay on the top of the Web scripting world.  It feels good to be on top.<p>

Not that they totally succeeded, but that's another topic...<p>

I kind of like Mozilla for the wild-eyed geeks.  It might work, but only if the Mozilla bunch has access to the key APIs Dave mentioned elsewhere today.  If HTTP is built into the OS -- as it should be -- then the Mozilla team shouldn't have to reinvent that wheel... and if HTML rendering is built into the OS -- as it should be -- there absolutely unquestionably must be hooks so that I can write a better renderer if need be.<p>

(There's a tangent here -- when people say the browser should be built into the OS, do they really mean that the renderer and the HTTP protocol should be built in?  There's a lot to a browser besides those two components.)<p>

Anyhow, if you have a Mozilla that's able to play on a level field, then there's a spur for the commercial browser to innovate.<p>

Another thing to consider -- is there money in browsers above and beyond the usual branding bonus?  When I click on About Navigator, I see logos from RSA, Bitstream, Marimba, INSO, SGI, Visigenic, Object Design, Netcast, and Full Circle, plus a mention from Sun.  So here's a question:  who's paying who?  It's often not as clear as one might think.
