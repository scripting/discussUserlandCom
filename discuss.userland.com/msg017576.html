Wow.<p>

This reminds me a little of a book about a tenage band, the Hansons, which I saw in a bookstore two years back. Although the youngest member was just 9 years old and the band existed for only a couple of months, it had a chapter called "The early years." Now, in Internet times, the chapter reads "The early months." Very amusing. <p>

Thanks Dave for the link to my Seattle adventures.<p>
