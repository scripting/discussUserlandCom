If I had wanted to I could have arranged access to a lap top, and found a way to dial to access a provider, but I just wanted to be able to check e-mail and check a few things that have become a normal part of my life. The cafe filled my needs easily.<p>

For people who live in Latvia, the costs associcated with accessing the internet are prohibitive compared to the West. Local hone calls are the equivalent of 2 cents a minute, and access to the web throught the phone company is expensive for direct access or an ISP.<p>

For people who don't live on the internet like us folks, the abillity to surf for the same time and about the same cost as going to the movie is a treat until ubiquitous net access is truly univeral. A niche filled by internet cafes.<p>
