I missed all of yesterday, and wanted an easy way to get those hours back... :)<p>

I originally asked Dave this question, with the notion that there could be a script hidden somewhere on My.Userland.Com that I could just feed the URL of the XML file, but now I realize that ANYONE could have this little gem of a script hidden on their webserver, and I don't know about it!<p>

As an example, here's the 1AM story list from yesterday...<p>

Thanks a ton in advance.<p>
