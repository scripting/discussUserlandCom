FTP isn't two way communication, in the same sense as XML-RPC can be.<p>

In the FTP case, the client has to initiate the GET'ting and the PUT'ting.  The server has no say in when that happens.<p>

In the XML-RPC case, in theory it's more of a peer-to-peer connection than a client-server connect.  Dreamweaver could initiate the connection, and send the remote XML-RPC-enabled machine info, or the remote XML-RPC-enabled machine could initiate the connection and send Dreamweaver info.<p>

If Dreamweaver had an XML-RPC server built into it, it could receive information from Frontier (or any other XML-RPC source, like say, a Casbah server on Linux running a Python script that uses the Python XML-RPC client) that gave it information -- callbacks, notifications, etc. would be possible.<p>

Imagine working in a team environment and having glossary lists (etc) pushed to you without you having to ask.  You'd just register yourself for notification with the CMS when you started Dreamweaver, and whenever the glossary changed, the CMS would connect to your editor and dish it the new glossary info!<p>

The CMS could also let you know, for example, when pages were added/deleted/moved/renamed, so that you could have a "live" tree-view of the remote ODB/filesystem open on your screen!<p>

Oh, this would all be so EASY with YellowBox... sigh... it's too much money; Apple's blowing it again.<p>
