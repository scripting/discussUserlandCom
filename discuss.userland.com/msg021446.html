Yes.  However, this purpose can have riders.  All dominant systems can host riders.  Companies can and do engage in other purposes besides this.<p>

Josh Allen: <i>The idea that developers are getting "programmed" by their companies is truly ludicrous.</i><p>

Yes, that misinterprets my point entirely.  Companies don't turn folks into zombies.  But persons interested in goal Gp who join a company pursuing goal Gc will find Gc overwhelminlgy supercedes Gp.<p>

I only fault your logic for comparing unrelated contexts.  The context of group goals is not the same context as programming personality.<p>

Josh Allen: <i> And I just can't connect emotionally with your plea that a company should have a "right to survive".</i><p>

If you review my posts you'll see I don't reword your positions as you do mine.  Everytime you say I claim companies have right to survive, it pisses me off because I said no such thing, and it frankly makes me look stupid.  I ignored the earlier occurences because I thought you might stop doing it.<p>

Which part of this ridiculous interpretation of my words do you want me to defend?  I didn't say it.  Please don't take this as a flame.  I just request that you not put words in my mouth.
