However, if they don't like what people are doing they can easily prevent it with a bit of application of technology. Here's one brain-dead-simple scheme: suppose that Universal identifies the set of pages that you can link to; each of these pages will place a cookie into your browser, and only those pages will. The cookie expires after a very short while, let's say 30-60 minutes. The pages to which you're not supposed to link check for the presence of the cookie; if the cookie is not present, they redirect you to the front page of the site. If the cookie *is* present, it is refreshed so that the expiration is pushed out another 30-60 minutes into the future and the page is served. The net result: you can only see the internal pages if you came into the site through one of the "blessed" pages.<p>

Questions:<p>

Is this scheme sound?<p>

If it is, doesn't the existence of such a simple technical scheme invalidate any legalistic objections that Universal has?<p>

Isn't this kind of scheme very simple to implement with Frontier?
