It was a bullet point. Let's double-click on it.<p>

Java in its "uber-ness" was a smoke-blow. <p>

I remember having a conversation with a Java exec at Sun, I said let's get Java running in Frontier. With a straight face she told me I had to covert to Java. <p>

This was the same argument they had with Microsoft. Pretty brave of them considering they had no way to deliver the functionality they would have needed to challenge Windows. <p>

Now, if Java had been a full desktop OS in 1995, they could have taken a big share of the market from MS. But they didn't. That's the smoke-blow.
