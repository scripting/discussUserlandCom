First, <a href="http://www.eazel.com">Eazel</a> is not an app.  It is a company.  One app they are producing is a Finder-like utility called <a href="http://nautilus.eazel.com">Nautilus</a>.<p>

Considering that Nautilus is being designed by people who worked on the original Mac, and considering that there are numerous companies (IBM, Dell, HP, Sun, not to mention Red Hat, HelixCode, and Eazel) who have a strong desire to see Linux on the desktop succeed, I don't doubt that there is a good chance they will make some headway in getting Linux "into the average user's home".<p>

Will it be enough to displace Apple?  There is a good chance.  Especially if attention is paid to the HI details.  And Eazel seems to be making a point of that.<p>

How about Microsoft?  Well... We'll have to see about that one.<p>

Mark.
