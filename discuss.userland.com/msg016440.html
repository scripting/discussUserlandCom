I had a similar thought the other day when I saw the latest WIRED sitting on the floor. I had zero motivation to read it. It's simply not as compelling as Scripting News, David McCusker's Treedragon.com, Wes' discussion group, Camworld's information architecture commentary, Joel Spolsky's rants, etc.<p>

But, if WIRED did a retrospective issue that reexamined features of several years ago, I'd read every word. In fact, I'll strongly support any publisher that routinely revisits its stories. Bonus points for those pubs that focus on where they got it wrong. I bet the Cluetrain Manifesto has a thesis on this. Publishers might want think about this: Would you rather have someone else do the retrospective?
