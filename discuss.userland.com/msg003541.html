(a) do you really need everyone reloading every 5 seconds? Sure, sometimes everyone needs to reload at once, but it seems like a waste to have to settle on a fixed interval.<p>

(b) is outline/HTML enough by itself as structured format? (vs MindMaps, spreadsheets, etc.)<p>

(c) would a better architecture be something where smaller objects are being refreshed (e.g. the current item) rather than the whole "page"? If everyone had Frontier on their machine, it might allow something more granular. (Or, per item a, you could just "push" the page when you hit F8, rather than the constant 5-second polling...) This is why people try and work with the semi-ubiquitous Java VM. (Not saying that it would work today...) (Hmmm, kinda like Notes with real-time replication...?)
