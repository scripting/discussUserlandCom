And while we're at it, why isn't the web integrated with the rest of my computer: I should be able to select a word in a word processor and tell my browser to go go get me the definition from an online dictionary, synonyms from a thesaurus, or just search the web for that word.<p>

why are we so limited? There's a lot left to do! These are just a few examples.. Almost all the browsers seem to ignore the endless array of useful possibilities that are right there.  Apple's sherlock almost does this, but why have the extra step of copy & paste?<p>

the list goes on....<p>
