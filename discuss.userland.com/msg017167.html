You're not sending usernames and passwords in plaintext anymore, but you are still sending something in the clear that can be grabbed and reused.<p>

If I can somehow get the MD5 hash of your username and password, e.g. by sniffing your network connection, I can pass that string back to Manila and still do nasty things.<p>

I suppose you could add something to the username:password string that would make it unique each time, but somehow there needs to be a way for the client and server to agree on what's going to be added.  And it has to be changed constantly, otherwise you have the same situation all over again.<p>

It's a tough problem to solve correctly.<p>

One approach is to use a challenge and response during the same connection, and repeat that every time someone connects, but HTTP is usually connectionless.<p>

Perhaps it all needs to happen over SSL.<p>
