So here's my thinking: FrameMaker can give nicely formed XML output based on it's internal style/tagging. That XML can live in Frontier quite nicely. XMLTR could be configured to translate that XML code into FrameMaker's tag format, which Frontier could incorporate into a FrameMaker template with the correct styles, and then that document could be output to PDF.<p>

Now, it would be great if FrameMaker would allow you to <i>import</i> XML code, and do the translation to frame-tags itself, but that doesn't appear to be the way Adobe is going with the non-SGML version of FrameMaker.<p>

An interesting aside to all of this is... it looks like Adobe has plans to incorporate <i>full</i> XML support into GoLive. They've got some limited support in the 4.0 release, and the GoLive lead engineer that I talked to at Seybold Boston hinted strongly that real XML editing and creation capabilities weren't too far off..
