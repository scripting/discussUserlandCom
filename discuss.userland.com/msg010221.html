Your challenge, should you decide to accept it, is to be the first have a DG message that you posted achieve more than 10,000 reads.<p>

The content has to be compelling, or has to be linked to by some other site or set of sites, somehow (you should tell us) you must achieve a high-read-level without resorting to writing a script that mindlessly reads your message. We'll watch for this and disqualify messages that take shortcuts.<p>

Hint: Look at the <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/stats/mostReadMessages">Top 25</a> list for a clue as to what kinds of messages achieve high read counts.
