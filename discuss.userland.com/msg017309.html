Occasionally.  Sometimes software can be "free" (gratis, free beer) and still not be "free" (libre, free speech).<p>

General use of the term "open source" has gone a long way to confusing the two (hence why so many people don't like the term), even though it was originally meant for the libre use.  When people say "free in the GNU sense" they do mean libre.
