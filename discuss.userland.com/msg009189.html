You're right, I'm against lock-in and therefore don't want no stinkin SDKs.<p>

OTOH, I agree that new technologies should be low-tech and discoverable to people who know HTML. I don't think Jakob is adopting the Tog rant that programmers are conspiring to deprive him or his audience of power.<p>

To Tog, half of the programmers in the world (or so it seems) work for Microsoft, and therefore are programming their hearts away for MSFT stock options. Their motives are very different from the rest of us. So if you want to divide the world up, start there. There is no Programmer's Union, or even a Programmer's Conspiracy, conscious or unconscious.
