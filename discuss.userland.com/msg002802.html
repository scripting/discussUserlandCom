Absolutely. Let me tatoo that on my forehead for all to see. XML-RPC 1.0 is set in stone. It will never change. Anything that comes after will be optional.<p>

However, the advantage of having a plug-in format will get Allaire to use our package format for WDDX, and there are a lot of Cold Fusion developers we'd like to be compatible with.<p>

And surely Sun, IBM, AOL, Apple, Novell, W3C, you name it, are surely working on object serialization formats. Now we could say to them that they should adopt XML-RPC as their encoding format, but they're going to go their own way, each of them behaving as any gorilla would. I like the ability to specify a format for parameters because it says we're OK with people cooking their own formats, and we can work with them.<p>

I've been to this place before, I think. Being rigid is not a good idea. Yes, it means that you get clients and servers that are only partially compatible with other clients and servers. That's why it's nice that we have a 1.0 spec that's deployed to fall back on.
