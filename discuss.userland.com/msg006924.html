I brought up the default DISCUSS page and clicked on "List Topics" and was given a list of newe topics. A nice short list with the topics from June 1999 only.<p>

How do I get those new topics that may have been started in the last few days of May without having to dig around in the daily activity screens looking for new messages??<p>

A list of new topics by month/year would be nice, along with maybe going back a few days or a week into the end of the previous month. You wouldn't want to do this for the whole month but it sure would help during the first few days, or maybe a week.<p>
