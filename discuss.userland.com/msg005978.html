I was sitting in the Apple Help session today at WWDC and something very interesting was mentioned. You see, Apple Help is based on html with a nice, lean help browser (HTML 3.2 compliant). Apple is going to release, at some point in the future, a library that can be used in applications to do rendering of HTML, without requiring a 3rd party browser. They have a session dedicated to it later in the week, so we'll know more, but I thought it was ironic that the very topic was discussed over the weekend right here.<p>
