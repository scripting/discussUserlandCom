this isn't an NDA at all. it is likely that all major content sites sign very similar agreements because a) they generally abide by the prohibitions and b) they aren't the sites that the terms and conditions are targeted to. it's mostly a CYA situation and the worse that can happen to you is that flycast turns you off. you'd need to do something pretty egregious to get there.<p>

you might consider starting with one of the freebie and easy to get started networks like LinkExchange.
