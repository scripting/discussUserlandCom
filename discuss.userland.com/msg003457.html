Sure. I didn't imply that this is not a good thing, it just contradicts my expectations in two ways: DG has an external htmlinterfaces part (which mailtothefuture doesn't have), while the messages are stored inside discuss.root (but the messages of mttf are stored in members.root, which, BTW, *also* serves as a part of the discussion group, but only for member information, not the messages...)<p>

The reason I describe this in detail is to make you aware that there are already *several* paradigms of information architecture in Frontier as of today: Sometimes the content is stored separately from member information/or/html-interfaces, sometimes not; sometimes overrides are valid, sometimes not -- I'm afraid that I'll get lost, not *in* the root, but *between* them.<p>

So, I just keep asking (I have a visual chart to do...;-))<p>

<b>config.mainresponder.domains</b><p>

I get an error 500 when I try to notate domains in config.mainresponder.domains like this:
["Mac HD:Frontier:Nirvana Server:rainbow.root"].index<p>

The error goes "file '[....].index' not found". Is something misconfigured here? If I omit the trailing ".index", everything is o.k. (perhaps I should add here that ".index" exists.)
