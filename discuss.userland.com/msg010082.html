If this gains traction it will become an important standard for including user-written text in a content management system, directly connecting to user-oriented desktop text editing tools. This is how we factor the limited text editors in web browsers, by making the editors we love more intimate with HTTP (thru XML-RPC of course). Support is welcome from HTML editors (eg Word, Golive, Dreamweaver) and user-oriented databases (eg FileMaker, Access) as well as programmer editors such as BBEdit and Emacs. It's an open protocol, we also welcome competition on the server side, and in fact we plan to provide an excellent outliner to hook in on the workstation side. If you're interested in the future of writing for the web at a plumbing level, please check this out. <i>Thanks!</i><p>

Eric Folley: <a href="http://www.nomadder.com/frontier/autowebedit">suites.autoWebEdit</a>. "This suite is designed to make using WebEdit easier: when you open a webpage, this suite automatically checks it out for you; close the page, it's automatically checked in." <i>Good idea!</i><p>

<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?990827.hnomg.htm">InfoWorld</a>: "The long-sought ability to run applications on different servers in far-flung places over the Internet without an army of high-end developers came a step closer this week as the Object Management Group (OMG) adopted the CORBA Component Model." <i>Why wait? <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> is doing this right now, not in the next millenium!</i><p>

Once again I get good links from <a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?back=archive99/now0827.txt">ntk.net</a>. "If we had Xanadu you'd realise how out of context all these quotes are." Hey they follow the DG here. <i>Thanks!</i><p>

Hey <a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=MACR&d=t">Macromedia</a> has two new products! Here are some pictures and screen shots. <a href="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/macromediaannounce/generatorArchitecture.gif">1</a>, <a href="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/macromediaannounce/generatorAuthoring.gif">2</a>, <a href="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/macromediaannounce/generatorOnline.gif">3</a>, <a href="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/macromediaannounce/generatorOutput.gif">4</a>. Here's the scoop on the two products. One is an improved version of their <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/generator/productinfo/">Generator</a> server-side engine, and the other is an add-on that allows Adobe Illustrator users to generate Flash-compatible content. Not earth-shaking, evolutionary. That's always a good idea. (I'm looking for the press releases now. If you find them send me a pointer.)<p>
