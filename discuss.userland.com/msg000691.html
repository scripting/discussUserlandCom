All of a sudden your history includes the history of the company that acquired you. When a Netscape person talks about his or her company, no matter how strange it feels, "we" started in the mid-80s as a replacement for AppleLink, not out of a research lab in Illinois. <p><p>I've been here before, selling a company that was fully assimilated by the acquiring company. That's the strange thing, history is restated, even legally and financially, and definitely strategically, and the hardest part, culturally.<p>

A small example of what can happen: the Compaq acquisition of <a href="http://www.altavista.com/">http://www.altavista.com/</a>. What had been brewing as a cultural feud evaporated when Compaq took over. They paid the man a few million dollars to develop an asset that will be worth billions. That's the way Case thinks too, he gets out the checkbook, and he's the boss now.<p>
