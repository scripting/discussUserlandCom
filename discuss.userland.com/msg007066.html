I've tried so many things, but I just can't figure this one out. I'm running an intranet, and I'd like to run it faster! MacOS 8.6, latest Frontier 6 update, G3.<p>

I've tried: Frontier solo, through Webstar (with the Nirvana plug-in), with huge amount of memory.<p>

I've talk to my IT Director about network speeds. No problems there. I'm running with almost no graphics.<p>

I'm running a fully dynamic site. Nothing is static - and I do mean nothing. Hey - why not actually <i>use</i> all those great features?<p>

I'm <i>sure</i> that there's something I've missed. Either in config.root, or user.webserver. And I'm not willing to go back to static pages: I want the new functionality I've got running.<p>

Can anyone help me out here? Is there a different way of serving through Webstar?
