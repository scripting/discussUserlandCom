I've seen a couple of products under embargo, other than our own and Groove, that are building new functionality outside the Web browser. A year ago this would have been unthinkable, now it's almost defacto.<br><br>	This adds confusion for sure. Each of the new environments continues the tradition started with Hypercard. Some are good at running apps, but have no developer tools. Some are pretty and others stark and colorless. No single offering does everything that's needed. They're all trying to do the same thing, imho -- be the next platform, or surface, to insert new code between the user and the Internet. Each has to deal with stiff competition from the Web, that can be easy to overlook. Too easy. The Web is the most enormous platform ever. <br><br>	And even that is Hypercardish, which had to compete with the famous Macintosh GUI.<br><br><b>Defensive indifference<a name="defensiveIndifference">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/01#defensiveIndifference" title="Permanent link to 'Defensive indifference' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Now in this context the excesses of the dot-com era are seen more clearly. Had Netscape grown organically, and carefully, with regard for Web developers (people who use HTML, not Java or XML), we'd have a two party system, and progress wouldn't have to happen outside the browser. <br><br>	Instead the VCs played the hype organ, put figureheads in charge, people who know nothing about developer communities, or even anything about the Web. They made noises like they understood, and who could contradict that, people were making so much money, they were happy. But the technology died. The developers went nowhere. And Microsoft took over the market without opposition.<br><br>	In the last game of the World Series in the 9th inning with the Yankees up by two and tasting victory, Bennie Agbayani took second base, and the Yankee catcher didn't bother trying to throw him out. I wondered how the scorekeeper would record this. Was it an error? A stolen base? <br><br>	I looked it up. "Defensive indifference." I had never heard that term before. And that's exactly what Silicon Valley and the rest of the tech industry did with the Web. We let Microsoft steal the base and never put up any realistic opposition.<br><br><b>The Mac OS X plan<a name="theMacOsXPlan">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/01#theMacOsXPlan" title="Permanent link to 'The Mac OS X plan' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Yesterday Brent and I talked about the plan for releasing our Mac OS X server software. The goal is to reintroduce ourselves to the Macintosh world, asking them to take another look at something that is radically different from what they knew four years ago. Experience has shown this can be difficult, so we're going to stage the rollout in such a way that it's impossible to miss the difference.<br><br><b>Share the flow<a name="shareTheFlow">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/01#shareTheFlow" title="Permanent link to 'Share the flow' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://manila.userland.com/" title="Manila is an Internet server application that allows groups of writers, designers and graphics people to manage full-featured, high performance web sites thru an easy-to-use browser interface."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/thisIsAManilaSite2.gif" height="31" width="88" border="0" alt="This is a Manila Site" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"></a>Speaking of promotion, we have a new badge for Manila, and if you are running a free site on a UserLand server we ask that that you show it, with pride, in your site template.
