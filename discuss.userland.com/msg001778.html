Seems like a near-perfect XML application, but I cannot find anybody providing the service -- and we are willing to pay.<p>

I have searched the 'main' XML sites (such as XML.com, etc.) and found nothing. A search on Scripting.com provided no help, but it did turn up that Charlie of Vignette was looking for the same thing back in October. Any luck finding it Charlie?<p>

Does anyone know of such a service, or even where to subscribe to get near-realtime stock quotes to relay to your audience?<p>
