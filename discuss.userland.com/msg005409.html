He was quoted recently as saying that his biggest competitor is his own installed base.<p>

If true, they are in the migrating business, not the OS business or the apps business.<p>

As a developer with an installed base I can relate. We did both kinds of upgrades in the last couple of years. The transition from Frontier 4 to 5 was rough. The transition from 5 to 6, while not perfect, has been much less glitchy.<p>

In the case of Apple, it appears that most of the to-do about the transition to OS X is noise. According to people who know it's an easy transition. Apple could do some selling here, to talk gently to developers, hit us with a feather instead of throwing rocks. If they want developers to go with them, they still have a lot to learn about the politics and economics of these kinds of transitions.
