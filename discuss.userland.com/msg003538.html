All your problems and hassles with cross-bropwser DOM and scripting is enough of a lesson for ALL OF US to learn from.<p>

It don't work yet.<p>

Sorry - that's not my fault.  But I'm not gonna pour good money after bad intoa  black hole of development - and then have it all surplanted when 'they' (both Netscape and MS) finally figure out how to be 'compatible'.<p>

It may NEVER happen.<p>

Good luck though - my heart goes out to you.  And let's hope that your investors and sponsors don't notice.<p>

:-)<p>

So that's why we bite the bullet - both for a powerful OO oriented environment (we'll be converting to XSL next) but also that explains my idealistic attitude towards Broadband. <p>
