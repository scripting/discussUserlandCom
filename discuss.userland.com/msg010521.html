"...And it can be difficult to get a site listed at Yahoo. I suspect you have to pay them money, but where is this discussed or disclosed on the Yahoo site?"<p>

The <A HREF="http://docs.yahoo.com/info/suggest/">"Suggest A Site"</A>  link talks about their general process of getting site information. This page is hyperlinked from the main "www.yahoo.com" home page. In addition, they answer several questions on their <A HREF="http://docs.yahoo.com/info/faq/faq.html#listinfo">FAQ page</A>  about sites being added to their list. Scripting News itself is listed <A HREF="http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Programming_Languages/Scripting_Languages/">here</A>. Were you ever asked to pay for that?
