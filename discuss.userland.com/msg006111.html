The computer came back, and as I suspected, it still has the same problem it had when we sent it back.<p>

My email to Michael Dell was effective insofar as it got me a response from someone in their Executive Support department, offering a $300 credit and three free deliveries.<p>

However I still don't have a working laptop, and now it's 442 hours.<p>

I'm considering buying a ThinkPad and sending the bill to Dell.
