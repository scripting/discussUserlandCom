While both Amsterdam and Venezia are built around canals, in Venezia there are no paved streets, no cars, all cabs are boats; there are boat buses (vaporazzi), the street signs are boat-oriented, construction and beer delivery is all done by boat. There are walkways and alleys and footbridges. The main entrances of all the grand houses are on the canal. While I was blown away by the beauty of Amsterdam, nothing could prepare me for Venezia. An incredibly rich place, but go soon, because the city is sinking.<br><br><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$738">Fourteen pictures</a> from Firenze. (Florence.)<br><br><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$719">Two</a> <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$720">pictures</a> of the Alps taken from an airplane.<br><br>I took a five hour train ride from Firenze to Trieste, passing through <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$736">Bologna</a>, which when you type it starts out with many of the same letters as Blogger.<br><br>The central piazza in <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$739">Trieste</a>.<br><br><a href="http://discuss.outliners.com/msgReader$598">Jim Crossett</a>: "Anyone have any ideas on how to get the info from Grandview files into a modern word processor?"<br><br>Oliver Breidenbach's WWDC trip <a href="http://farsideofmymind.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$326">continues</a> through the California redwoods and Crater Lake.<br><br>The new design for <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls Weblog</a> came online while I was in Europe. <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2000/05/10">On May 10</a> he quoted Machiavelli on the development of the market in Florence (also known as Firenze), one of the places I visited.<br><br>Many thanks to Paolo Valemarin, Simone Bettini, and the other very sweet people at <a href="http://www.studioidea.it/">StudioIdea</a>, who were my hosts in Trieste. They put me up at a very fine hotel, and shared the work they've been doing with Frontier. Both Paolo and Simone are brilliant, Paolo is a visionary and designer, and Simone, to me, is an Italian Brent Simmons. They started doing a Manila-like content management system before we released Manila, so our software shares a common foundation but the sites are not compatible. They've done some very excellent work with XSL and image management, probably other things that I don't yet understand. We're going to work with them, I want our work to be compatible, and I want Manila users to get the benefit of their hard work and brilliance. But most important, I enjoyed their company, that makes working together something I look forward to. <br><br>Hey they've got a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/dinnerInTrieste.gif">picture</a> of our first night's dinner on the StudioIdea website. "Veramente utile ed interessante!" If my Italian <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/paolosCopyTranslatedToEnglish.gif">serves</a> me well, that means truly useful and interesting. <i>Agreed!</i><br><br>Funny experience, driving to the store a few minutes ago, turned a corner, and somehow expected that I would see a statue by Michelangelo. Then I remembered, we don't have <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$721">them</a> here.<br><br>Jerome Camus reminds me that FreeServe only works in the UK. Even so, I recommend them, if you're in the UK. Very fast, and as advertised, totally free.<br><br>I've been reading trash novels the last couple of weeks, it's better than watching TV, and gives me something to do while eating lunch in places like <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$730">Piazza Republica</a> in Firenze. I'm currently reading The Brethren by John Grisham, which is real easy, and was surprised to find a very minor character named Dale Winer in the book, a money-man for defense contractors. I had to look three times. <br><br>I recommend Hearts in Atlantis by Stephen King, a remembrance of the 60s with the usual King weirdness. Yes, I remember the 60s. Were they that strange? Hard to say, when you're that young everything seems weird.<br><br><i>I can't believe how fast the Net is!</i><br><br>
