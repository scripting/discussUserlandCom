Up to last week, dates put in as DD-MM-YY with YY between 40 and 90 coerced fine, but since the start of the new year the statement: Date( "27-11-48" ) yields "21-10-1912; 17:31:44" whereas earlier (in 1999) it would yield: "27-11-1948; 0:00:00"</i><p>

If only the last two digits of the year are given, you obviously have to make certain assumptions. For the Mac OS toolbox call StringToDate, these assumptions are described here:<p>
