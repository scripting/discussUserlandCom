I'm going to knock heads with the ISP again, not looking forward to that. Couldn't come at a worse time. Stay tuned.</i><p>

Heads up. Today I'm going to start pointing to pages that document features in Manila. I've been holding back on this, but now it's time to open up to the next level. I expect we'll flip the switch before the holiday (Thurs) and the <a href="http://store.userland.com/">store</a> will start delivering 6.1s instead of 6.0s. All current subscribers will receive 6.1 at no additional charge. The press release won't run until everyone is back at work next week. This will be the biggest change in functionality in Frontier's 11-year history. Now, for the first time, the power of web content management becomes easy.<p>

Manila-Newbies: <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$160#howYourHomePageWorks">How Your Home Page Works</a>. "Manila doesn't enforce a rigid set of constraints on how your home page works, instead it provides a set of features that accomodate several different styles."<p>

Today's <a href="http://release1.userland.com/">new Manila site</a> is from Kevin Werbach, Managing Editor of Esther Dyson's Release 1.0. Kevin did a great report covering syndication technology, summarized <a href="http://release1.userland.com/issues/syndication">here</a>, published in July 1999.<p>

Beebo.Org: <a href="http://beebo.org/metalog/ratings/">Weblog Ratings</a>. "The score is calculated as follows: over 150 weblogs are retrieved and scanned for links to other weblogs. A link to a weblog is considered a vote for that weblog; each vote is worth 10 divided by the number of links to other weblogs. (So a weblog linking to 20 other weblogs will contribute 0.5 to the total score of each weblog it links to.)" <i>Excellent!</i><p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13251">Jakob Nielsen</a>: "This is almost exactly what Google is doing for the entire Web."<p>

<a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://robotwisdom.com/weblogs/huger.html">Jorn Barger</a> may be doing something interesting with ads. Not sure exactly how it works.<p>

<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,32684,00.html">Wired</a>: "Available for free, the Winfix patch peels off the space-age look from Apple's search tool, which is bundled with the MacOS 9. The patch reverts the interface back to the familiar window-and-scroll-bar that Mac users know and love."<p>

I continue to be in awe of <a href="http://www.camworld.com/">CamWorld</a>. He has done a brilliant job of getting everyone to point to him!<p>

Weblog Monitor got me back in touch with Chris Gulker's <a href="http://www.gulker.com/">weblog</a> where he asks if everyone has an Uncle Ken? I don't know about everyone, but I do!<p>

Look closely at this <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.greatvavavoom.com/pictures/viewer$66">picture</a>, you'll see the beginning of my uncle's affiliate program. "Recommended by www.greatvavavoom.com." Someday you'll see this sign at all the great hippy beaches. <p>

I started a <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/tools">new page</a> on the Weblog Monitor site listing tools for creating and running weblogs.<p>

Press release: <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/991122/ca_lumeria_1.html">Lumeria announces DTD.COM</a>. "DTD.com will also aggregate these DTDs or tags and submit them for approval by the appropriate standards committees as a way of accelerating the standardization of XML." Looks like they pulled the trigger too soon. Clicking on <a href="http://www.dtd.com/">www.dtd.com</a> gets an authentication request. <i>Oooops!</i><p>

The Obvious: <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archives/112299.html">My Ass is a Weblog</a>. "Inside of a year, the inevitable winnowing will be complete, and the weblog community will have matured into something efficient, useful and blessedly quiet. The remaining webloggers will go about their business, providing links and commentary, without all the noisy hoo-ha of revolution."
