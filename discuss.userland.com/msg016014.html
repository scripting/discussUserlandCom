My logical train of thought asks, "<i>If code is protected speech, how can you patent it?  Shouldn't it be more analogous to a copyright?</i>"  This seemed to be the thrust of the arguments presented by Dave and Tim O'Reilly and it seems that this court decision lends credence to that thought.  Very interesting.<p>

PS  Dave, if I may, any reason why you are now David Winer in the discussion group?
