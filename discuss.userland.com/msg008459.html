I'm relearning about Dell service. They sent a tech out today to replace the motherboard and heat probe on SuperHonker. Ten minutes after the guy left it thermal failed again. Restarted. Ten minutes later it failed. Called Dell. On hold for fifteen minutes. They'll send the tech out again tomorrow with a new CPU. I asked if this is how they do diagnostics, and the rep said yes. Trial and error, in the meantime we had to rearrange our servers to work around the outage.
