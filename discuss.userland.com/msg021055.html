hire you or your lawyer ;-)<p>

First, it's important to note that CNRI and RMS agrees on
the basic principles here.  Your forum argument is mostly
bogus; RMS doesn't necessarily want a court to decide what
happens, he's just worried that the clause clashes with GPL
as it stands today.  As BeOpen's Tim Peters put it on
comp.lang.python:<p>

<blockquote>
<i>I wouldn't be surprised if RMS would also *like* the applicable
law to be specified!  His reaction has been much more of a "hmmm"
than a "NO! THAT'S EVIL!" so far.  Perhaps something related will
even show up in GPL 3.  But, for now, GPL 2 is what exists, and he
has to defend it for what it says.</i><p>

<p><i>I confess I don't see the problem.  GPL clause 6 says "You
may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise
of the rights granted herein", which is presumably the source of
the conflict, and I just don't see *which* right granted by the
GPL is restricted by CNRI spelling out the intended meaning of
their license.</i><p>

Second, Stallman *is* talking directly to CNRI.  Stallman's
legal advisor (don't remember his name) hasn't been directly
involved yet; as I mentioned earlier, we're all waiting for
him to talk to CNRI's lawyers, face to face.  Since both
parties agree on the basics, the negotiations are open
(it's not a "do as I say or else" situation).  Quoting
Stallman himself:<p>

<blockquote>
<i>Whether a given license A is compatible with another 
license B is not a decision, not a choice someone can 
make.  It is a judgement about the nature of the situation, 
based on the facts and laws as they exist /.../</i><p>

<i>However, law and its consequences are not as rigorous as 
mathematics. It is peculiar that their lawyers think the 
licenses are compatible. I suspect that they have missed 
some point about the GPL, but that is just a guess; I have 
not spoken with them and do not know their arguments.  It 
is conceivable they saw something I and our lawyer missed.</i><p>

<p><i>We are trying to arrange for him to talk with them.
That should at least make it possible for one side to convince 
the other about whether the licenses are compatible.  If 
they can convince us that the incompatibility we saw is not 
real, that would be fine--it would make the problem 
disappear.  Alternatively (and I think more likely) our 
lawyer will show them the incompatibility they did not see.</i><p>
