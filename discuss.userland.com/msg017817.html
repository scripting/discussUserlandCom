The front page introduction also mentions the Salon title ("Courtney Love does the Math"), not sure who titled it though:<p>

"Courtney sounds off on the state of today's sordid and malicious recording industry in an uncensored quasi-essay that provided the basis for her speech at this year's Digital Hollywood in New York. Love does the math, delves into the industry's darkest fissures, exposes the miscreants, and welcomes the future's "radical democratization" through the course of her writing in an effort to dispel the corporate-engineered myths that have long plagued artists."<p>

The <A HREF="http://www.holemusic.com/news/index.html">news page for holemusic.com</A> mentions the manifesto was posted on June 14, 2000.
