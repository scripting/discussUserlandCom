EDITING............<p>

No one mentioned shortcuts! I love this manila feature. I don't know yet how to make it even easier; perhaps to show a pop-up of shortcuts available on the site or list them in a side window. <p>

Spell check! More "documents" are being created in email and DG today than in Word. Give us the bare minima that compensate for our weaknesses. <p>

Like most folks in the UserLand universe, i organize my thoughts in lists and sublists. Outlining within the TextArea. Perhaps: 
- one level of bullet
-- second level
parsed in UL/OL and LI elements? perhaps even into xml structures?<p>

give author the ability to append a signature string/field. <p>

please remember to think about the DG UI in the context of PalmPilots, docked and wireless. i should be able to snag a thread for offline reading and respond via a simple form or email. <p>

additional data fields. if i host a forum on movie reviews, let me add fields that i want to collect from contributors as part of each DG post. thumbsUp? worth full price? best moment? within a forum, it may be worth the added complexity to provoke thoughtful or broader responses. In a DG that reviewed career web sites, what fields might you want to have as at least optional parts of a review? A DG about comparing DG UI designs? <p>
