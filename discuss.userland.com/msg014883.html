What if there was a way to abstract the "feature" from the "interface" such that I could choose one of a number of interfaces.  There are a growing number of applications which do this - just look at <a href="http://www.skinz.org">http://www.skinz.org</a> which shows off many people's creative work on trying to improve user interfaces.  It would be great if someone came up with a way to make website features "skinnable".
