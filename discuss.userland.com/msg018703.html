<p>I’ve been a lurker on Scripting News for quite a while but this is my first post. In the last <b>DavNet</b> piece Dave Winer expressed his desire to subscribe to music via the Internet and I quote:</p>
<p><i>I want to subscribe to music, to get a monthly bill, like my cable bill, but I want everything, and I want them to trust me, I want files on my hard disk, nothing less.</i></p>
<p>Well Dave I want to tell you that you can already do this. BackWeb, the company I work for, in a joint venture with RealNetworks has set up a service through which any RealJukebox installation can subscribe to receive music files (MP3s) automatically. This service called “Real.com Music Delivery” is still in beta and has some limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have to install RealJukebox for it to work.
<li>Currently only 2 songs a week.
<li>Subscription is very coarse – by genre only.
</ol>
<p>Some of these limitations may be removed once the system is officially released.</p>
<p>This system also has some great advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s free.
<li>Utilizes BackWeb’s “Polite” delivery protocol, which can download large files without impacting surfing performance for modem users.
<li>Puts the MP3 files on your disk.
<li>Plays an animation to notify you when a new file has arrived.
<ol>
