Hey, if you've been doing programming in websites in Frontier, you know about pageTables.<p>

And if you've been doing CGIs in Frontier, you know about paramTables.<p>

Each of them is a collection of strings and addresses and a few numbers that completely describe a process.<p>

In the first case, the process is rendering a page. In the second case, it represents the process of responding to a HTTP request.<p>

So, in 5.1, when the Betty server framework was finalized, these two creatures met, and mated and had an offspring that had the traits of both page and paramtables.<p>

That's what make .wsf pages so powerful. They act like CGIs but they render like a page on any Frontier website.<p>

So, this morning I'm writing about this stuff, and I thought it would be neat to have a page I could go to that would show me in real-time, what the page/paramtable for the request looks like. I spent about an hour studying this. It's very interesting! Have a look yourself:<p>
