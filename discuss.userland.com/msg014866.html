We have <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/">pictures</a> of the demonstration in Davos. <p>

Clinton's speech was excellent. I wish he would talk to the American people with the frankness, directness, evangelism he showed this afternoon in Davos. As you know I am not a big Clinton fan. Now I want to talk with him to see if we're talking about the same thing. I just heard he can't get out of town because it snowing so hard. Hmm. Maybe he hasn't got dinner plans??<p>

Unfortunately I can't mail this piece out, there's a technical problem "relay restricted" or something like that. Not sure what it's about, but there's no time to deal with it now. Sorry.<p>

US President Bill Clinton is coming to Davos today so the polizei are out in great numbers. They're <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$130">gathering</a> in large groups, <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$132">taking</a> the bus, and <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$129">holding</a> machine guns.<p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$131">Comfortable shoes</a> with ribbed soles are important in places with lots of snow, like Davos.<p>

Yesterday we met <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$134">Meds Brugger</a> of Virus magazine which he describes as the Danish Wired. He's a web guy, one of very few at Davos.
