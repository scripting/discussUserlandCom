And sure, there's web-based newsgroups, but lots of people still use
Usenet programs. Why? Because every web-based newsgroup facility I've
used (this one, and www.fool.com's, for instance) is painful by
comparison. Please don't say, "but Usenet is a waste of time filled
with lots of noise over content". I'm not talking about particular
newsgroups, but about the *protocol*. Use the standard and let *me*
choose what viewer (Yet Another Newswatcher, for instance) I use.<p>

I've asked countless times, though not at this site, why people can't
just use an NNTP server for their (optionally password-protected,
moderated, private) newsgroups. The usual answer is the need to hook
into proprietary databases, control page turns, etc. I'm sure Dave has
good personal reasons for thinking this is a better format for *his* forums.<p>

Where I'm headed is, so do other folks. A tool like XUL may give them
better leverage to invent the application they really want. Then the web browser becomes the proper framework for that application for *them*.
