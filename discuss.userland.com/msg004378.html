Or if I buy 5.1.6 I get 6.0 automatically?<p>

It's semi-confusing.
It's almost as if you have two products, one of which is already ok, and is extended by the other - a server side component...<p>


I assume I could just buy  5.1.6 (or whatever is the most recent) and when the time comes upgrade to 6.0 via the net somehow. Or even start beta testing 6.0 myself.
