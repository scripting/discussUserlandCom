I mention this because I was thinking about how Frontier was sort of like a fish struggling in a crowded pond with other fish, but now that it has acquired a new "mutation" (editthispage.com sites) it sort of has gained the ability to sort of flop around on land a bit.  And that gives it a whole new landscape to begin to explore.  <p>

I like that Dave and others are thinking of even newer "mutations" like Pike and SVG - because I think as Frontier/manila "evolves" - it gets ahead of the pack, as well as being in a unique postition as sort of the first "animal" in a new enviroment - sort of like how in Australia, marsupials took over since they were either there first or they were able to quickly overcome the other early-comers.<p>

Ah - I rant - <p>

Back to sorting laundry...
