This could be supported by using the existing OPTGROUP element and a special CSS style that affects the behavior of the SELECT element.<p>

Until then, if the scripts were enhanced to process and then remove the SELECT elements from a page during initialization, one could get similar behavior.<p>

Also, if you post your script at a standard location (rather than inlining the script code), others could refer to your script via URL and inherit updates.<p>

I'm not sure what you meant by "We're out of user interface room for Web apps."<p>
