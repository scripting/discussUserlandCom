It took less than 24 hours to code it top to bottom (we already had working SOAP, XML-RPC and RSS implementations). <br><br>To get a system like this running you must have good diagnostics so you can see what the various machines are saying to each other. Check out this <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/muotdLogCloudMsgs.gif">screen shot</a> of my Log page. Start with the "Hourly scan" event at 8:01:17AM and read up from there. You'll see a "Please notify" event immediately following the hourly scan because it had just discovered a <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/rss/radioUserland.xml">channel</a> with a <cloud> element. MUOTD automatically subscribes to any channel that has such an element. Then at 8:05:28AM we get the payoff with the "Channel change" event.

"What a schlep it'll be to go to the store," I thought to myself. Checked my mail. There was a box of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts in the mailbox. I kid you not. Five or six would have been enough but there seem to be 200. I'm afraid I'm going to eat them all. <i>Help!</i> ";->"<br><br><a href="http://napster.weblogs.com/">Another weblog</a> goes <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=bionic">bionic</a> with <a href="http://macros.userland.com/viewrssbox">viewRssBox</a>.<br><br>The Manila side of notification now works, when I update a channel on my desktop, in a few seconds references to it update within seconds.
