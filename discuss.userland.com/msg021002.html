Nope.  The goal is to have a single license, but to make sure
it's compatible with the GPL.<p>

CNRI has bent over backwards to change their original license
proposal into something that a whole bunch of lawyers (not only
CNRI's own people) claim is 100% compatible, under existing US
and international copyright and contract law.<p>

RMS agrees that it's mostly compatible, except for one clause.<p>

All lawyers disagree.  From what I hear, they think that this
license cannot be enforced if that clause is removed.<p>

RMS refuses to change his mind.<p>

The current plan is to put all those lawyers (including RMS's
legal advisors) in a single room, and not let them out before
they've sorted this one out.
