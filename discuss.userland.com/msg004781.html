The more I read about Double-Byte characters, the more I am afraid that it can be forced into Frontier. For one, while one is using double-byte character, active URL cannot be used, and to make this happen, the core of Frontier will have to be changed.<p>

I currently use UTF-8 to store all my CJK text, and convert the UTF-8 to classic CJK encoding on the finalFilter, and it works great since the UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII (You can serve UTF-8 directly if you want. But on pages that require form submission, like a DG, you will need to concern about whether the users can submit UTF-8 text or not).<p>

Entering UTF-8 text is trickier. There are two ways to do it:<p>

1) Edit the text externally on a Unicode editor.
2) Enter them in classic CJK encoding, but make a script to convert any selected object's encoding into UTF-8.<p>

While I am on this topic, I would like to ask if anyone know of a way to convert classic CJK encoding into UTF-8 on a PC. I used a Mac, and the above method works because there is a OSAX that does that. Is there anything like that available on a PC?
