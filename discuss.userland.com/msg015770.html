So I'm kind of wondering where the best place is to add more feature requests / UI design changes to the stack that someone from Userland (I think it was Brent) says is already huge, and to talk about stuff like that. Is there a semi-official space for stuff like that? Should there be?<p>

I put up my <a href="http://drothgery.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$80">Pike Ramblings</a> up on <a href="http://drothgery.editthispage.com">my ETP site</a>, because the web programmer in me thinks Pike is way cool, the web designer in me thinks it's a huge improvement over what I could do before, and the UI designer in me sees a lot of ways that Pike could be improved.
