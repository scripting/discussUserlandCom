I always used the paper blocks you get with the conference materials. And always these notes ended up in some drawers at the office. Dead information.<p>

On that sunday afternoon, I got my Palm III, w/ Mac Connection Pack.<p>

I took my notes during the whole week, stored them on my PB and still have them, searchable and accessible. Back in Austria, the Palm III totally replaced my paper-based organizer. Since the MacPack 2 (still beta) is out, I&#180;m really happy.<p>

The last thing I&#180;d want for it would be a Frontier conduit to be able to use the ODB as permanent storage system for every piece of information.<p>

A note on Graffiti: The pen strokes all really well designed and I got into it very, very fast.<p>
