When I save the window, it goes directly into the server's database. It's the fastest way yet to write for a server that's far away. I can always edit text in the web browser, but for more demanding writing jobs, there's nothing like having a smooth desktop writing app.<p>

Here's a <a href="http://www.outliners.com/images/frontier6/suitesDg.gif">screen shot</a> of the Frontier suite in action, with its menu pulled down. This still is quite rough, we're planning changes to the Frontier kernel to support this new usage. It's a work in progress. We encourage other writing tool vendors to compete with us. The more compatible writing tools there are, the more fun we'll have on the server.<p>

Next week we'll release the spec for the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$7">XML-RPC</a> calls that connect the workstation with the server. The interface is cross-platform, and will be easily supported on all major operating systems.<p>

"Billy Payne, the executive chairman of the Atlantic Olympic Committee, after explaining that there just weren't enough credentials to go around to include the masses of online reporters among the 10,000 or so other journalists, added ominously in 1996, 'We have our own Web site.'"<p>
