It's pretty easy to hold a USA-centric view if you're in the USA, but the rest of us out here aint likely to see ADSL commonly in use much before 2002.</i><p>

Lindon, you should check out IHUG's satellite systems at <<a href="http://www.satnet.com.au">http://www.satnet.com.au</a>>.  For AU$59/month you get unlimited high speed access to the internet.  In some ways it's not *quite* as good as ADSL, but it's much much better than other alternatives in this part of the world.  I've had it for several months now, and it's just great!<p>

They advertise it as 400 kbps but it's actually variable. Often you can't get quite that much on a single download, but I regularly get 250 - 300 kpbs, and by doing several downlaods in parallel I've had up to 1480 kpbs in the wee hours.<p>

For those with more money to spend, you can also get committed (guaranteed) bandwidth from the same company, in 64 kbps increments, at about US$500/month per 64 kpbs from the US to Aus/NZ/SE Asia/India/Southern Africa.  See <<a href="http://www.ihug.net/">http://www.ihug.net/</a>> and especially <<a href="http://www.ihug.net/bandwidth.htm">http://www.ihug.net/bandwidth.htm</a>>
