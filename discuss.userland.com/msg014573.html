The Mac is where a lot of publishing happens, and publishing and XML are closely related. Also, the XML-DEV crowd tends to be focused on Java and Unix, not Windows and Mac. <p>

Personally, I want to learn more about what Macromedia and Adobe are doing with XML. Having such a site will enable them to get feedback from developers and users. So it's a Good Thing. Keep on truckin!
