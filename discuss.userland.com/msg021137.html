If you want comments, the code is copyrighted but you can do just about whatever you want except alter the copyright or license.<p>

If you want public domain, all the comments must go.<p>

Thus there is an incentive to keep the comments which are useful, but one can still have totally operative code with no constraints at all when this is really necessary.<p>

The net effect is that the comments are copyrighted and licensed, while the code is not, since one can get a public domain copy of the code.
