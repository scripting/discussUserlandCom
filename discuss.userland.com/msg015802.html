<li> use your imagination... 
<li> hear what Dave is saying and stop being a dork.
<li> I hope she's a good law student, because you'll never make it as a writer.
<li> sigh...
<li> yes, you are right.  Dave wasn't talking about software here.  He wasn't using natural, familiar language to illustrate a point.  He was deliberately attacking women in general.  He hates <i>that</i> sex.  Men rule!
<li> Your right, being totally PC makes communication so difficult sometimes.
<li> I agree, Dave you are sexist AND Pike sucks. <i>[dumps plate of food on Dave's head]</i>
<li> Yah, and Dave forgot to mention that she's also not allowed to speak unless spoken too.
<li> You are smart.  I think it's because you're a man.
<li> Who's the one with inflexible societal baggage here?
