Dave says, regarding Open Source:<br>
Software is software, and I'd appreciate it if people who don't know  much about it and 
don't make it would stop preaching so enthusiastically if they also 
don't practice self-examination to be sure their businesses can stand  the same kind of scrutiny.
</i></p><p>

<p>There's a lot of hard-won wisdom in this statement.  Even though I 
am someone that <a href="http://www.digicool.com/Library/FTPB/index.html">preaches</a> 
about Open Source and business, I get pretty fed up with the zealots
trying to make decisions for that in which they have little to
lose.</p><p>

<p>I've given that presentation at three conferences now.  Each time I 
have a slide that asks the question: "Who is an owner of an Open 
Source software business?"  I then make everybody applaud these 
people, because they are the ones that really lay it on the line for 
Open Source.</p><p>

<p>Employing people is a social contract, and if you've never stared 
down the barrel of not having enough cash to make payroll one week, 
then thou hast little appreciation for thy preachings.</p>
