This actually isn't all that far fetched.  The current development KDE "filemanager" (loosely called that -- it's a lot more than a file manager) is made up of CORBA-derived components (KOM/OpenParts).  Every part of it is, well, a Part.  IF (and this is the Bif If), the Gecko engine was made into an OpenPart and Randy's bookmark was made into an OpenPart, and so on.. well, what you just decribed would be reality.
