Jini uses JavaSpaces which is an implementation of Linda, but it also provides many other services.<p>

The key point, Jini allows any number of Jini devices, be they VCRs, staples (yes, java vm's will appear in staples), or computers, to be federated into a personal network that can be used to do computational tasks.<p>

For example, you might want to create a VHS tape for your friend who has only a VCR and TV at home.  This tape includes 8 reruns of 'Law & Order' from this week.  You could type up a document that lists the shows using your smart stapler, staple the pages together.  The stapler has interfaced with your computer and has placed an electronic version of the document in the staple.  Now, take the document to your VCR, and from your computer, create a Jini netwrok that includes the VCR and the staple.  The staple can direct the VCR as to when to record, based on the document in the staple.  When the week is over, send the tape and paper document to your friend.<p>

Granted, this is way out there.  However, the idea is intriguing.<p>

There is a research project (with similar concepts) available at <a href="http://www.infospheres.caltech.edu/">http://www.infospheres.caltech.edu/</a> with many docs in HTML.<p>

In short, Jini provides distributed communications using RMI, transaction support within the federated networks, uses JavaSpaces for naming services, and can run in very small devices.  Cool stuff.<p>

As for interacting with it, the protocols are fully specified by Sun and are available on request.<p>
