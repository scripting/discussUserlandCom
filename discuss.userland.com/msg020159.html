Because they become part of the kernel, sticking their hooks deep inside and sometimes replacing parts of it, they create new forks when they are loaded. I've heard it said that there are almost as many forks of the Linux kernel as there are system configurations! Sad but true. There's an amusing spoof on this theme at <A HREF="http://bbspot.com/News/2000/4/linux_distros.html"><a href="http://bbspot.com/News/2000/4/linux_distros.html">http://bbspot.com/News/2000/4/linux_distros.html</a></A>.

The "forking libel" against BSD was promulgated by Eric Raymond because he had a vested interest in Linux. It's sad to see that some folks have swallowed his propaganda, like Stallman's, uncritically.
