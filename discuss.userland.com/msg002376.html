Odd that Borland/Inprise doesn't have a screenshot holding center
stage at their Delphi site.  <p>

As you look at Delphi, don't forget the large third-party commmunity.  A couple of great starting points are <a href="http://www.torry.ru">http://www.torry.ru</a> and <a href="http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/delphi">http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/delphi</a> - both sport large collections of components, many freeware with source. (No one talks about the open source movement much in the Delphi community, but its spirit is alive and well).<p>

BTW, you all can count this as a vote of interest in using XML-RPC in Delphi! :-)
