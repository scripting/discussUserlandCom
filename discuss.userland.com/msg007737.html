Instead, the innovation is happening <I>within</I> the standards themselves, they are progressing and advancing faster than can be implimented.  Also, the innovation is happening on top of the standards, building solutions that utilize the standards, be that in the tools or in the next generation of web-based applications.  <p>

So the browser is less a focal point of innovation and change, and more simply a vehicle to bring the latest new web technologies from other sources to the user.
