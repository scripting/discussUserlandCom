However, outlines are all about hierarchic nesting. There's no limit to the depth that <outline>s can be nested. The text of a single outline cannot nest, and I want it to be very simple so that processors can count on finding something simple there. It should be brain-dead easy to display the text for an outline. It may be completely insignificant to the processor, but it could be very significant to the reader.<p>

BTW, there are other possible attributes for <outline> elements. <p>

And thanks for the comment, discussion helps me know what issues people have.
