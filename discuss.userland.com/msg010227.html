Niklaus Wirth revolutionized my life. I owe him the recognition.<p>

My first Algol-like language was Simula 67.<p>

My second was Pascal.<p>

It was like a breath of fresh air!<p>

(Before Simula I was a Fortran programmer. When I learned Simula I kept getting frustrated that it was so hard to do GOTOs. But then I never even considered adding a GOTO to Frontier. Not for a minute.)
