You must change the license(or get it changed) to include GPL code legally.  If you do NOT change the license of the code, then you have broken the GPL contract, and can be sued.  <p>

The GPL can't just automatically take over, or make a contract on your behalf.  You can't even accidentally turn your non-GPLed code into GPLed code.  You have to EXPLICITLY change your non-GPLed code into GPLed code(or compatible) for you to legally include GPL code.  It isn't a meta contract.  The GPL only places conditions on the use of GPLed code, not other code.  No matter how many times you say otherwise, you can't change that fact.
