Assuming they knew that "sites such as weblogs" were less secure.  When one creates an on-line account, there's no some special verbage on the page that says "yea, pick a password, but this really isn't anything secure."  Joe User probably belives that anywhere they have a username and password, nobody else can see what that password is.  It doesn't matter if that's valid, that's what they believe.  We in the software industry can't assume that everyone knows as much about the systems they're using as we do :-)
