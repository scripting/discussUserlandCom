Surely that spot is reserved for something more urgent like, "I'll be back with reinforcements!"  Or something like that. :-)<p>

Dave Rogers: <i>There is something beautiful about the truth, plainly written.</i><p>

Whoa, thankyouveramuch.  The truth is different written plainly.  It's more obvious and makes you notice related things.  In particular, I like to disabuse folks of belief in too much power invested in other folks who seem to know what they are doing.  Knowing what you're doing doesn't entail a corresponding amount of power.  Some things are hard to control.<p>

It's so refreshing and gives me a chance to practice my blush.  Sometimes I wonder if folks merely tolerate my droning.  Normally I must judge blindly whether I'm helping at all.
