Wikiwiki is Hawaiian for "fast". <p>

Akamai (www.akamai.com) is Hawaiian for 'smart'. I'd like to sentence whoever coined the term 'Akamaized' to 100 years of 28.8 hell for abuse of our language. I wrote them about it, got a response from the webmaster thanking me for the feedback and he'd look into it. No further response.<p>

Is there some kind of trend going on here? Don't mind use of the language as long as they get it right.<p>
