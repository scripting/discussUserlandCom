I do live right in the area, so if you're looking for anything to do I can offer some suggestions:
<UL>
<LI>Playland - This is a park in Rye (quick drive down 287) with a beach and rides and a pretty nice atmosphere.
<LI>Kensico Damn - located in Valhalla (my home town).  I believe it's the biggets damn on the east coast.  There's a nice area out in front to lounge, read, walk around.  They usually do fireworks on the 4th there.  A good place to see them.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.hudsonvalley.org/">Historic Hudson Valley</A> - Plenty of hitsorical places like Sunnyside, Van Cortland and Philipsburg Manor to visit.
</UL><p>

Or you could stop by my workplace and laugh at how far behind in technology we are ;-)
