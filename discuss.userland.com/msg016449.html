Really? While I can't identify the tools used as easily as I might identify some filter unique to Photoshop, I find my writing <I>heavily</I> influenced by the tool I choose. Things written in a TEXTAREA are very different then things I write in Pike... and I like <A HREF="http://www.lyx.org">LyX</A> even more for really, really lengthy tomes.<p>

Try writing in Windows notepad sometime... with word wrap off... and see if you still think that your tool doesn't matter.<p>

I think that you can think that because you've never <I>seen</I> a truly writer-friendly tool.  MSWord ain't it.  Pike is getting there (still in beta, after all).  LyX is there, IMHO.  (It particularly helps when the tools don' actively <I>fight</I> the user the way Word.) Writer-friendly tools result in better organized flows in the final product and easier-to-develop flows in the drafting stages.  They can also definately cut down on time.<p>

Professional writers may grow to the point they are performing all of these functions in their head. However, for "the rest of us" they can be a big and definite help.
