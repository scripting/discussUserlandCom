The only thing they'll put up is stuff for public consumption which really doesn't affect internal processes and decisions.  Many will need to see their name in lights (their proprietary data on a channel) before they really see how it can help them.  <p>

My feeling is that you may need to get the server software out sooner...which brings me back to where we started.<p>
