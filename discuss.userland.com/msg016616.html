Apache should become a CMS? (Sometimes it is hard to follow your line of thought, especially if you add the language gap.)<p>

As much as I believe in diversity, I can not agree. Apache can be what they want it to be. Someone else can add the CMS. I also believe in empowering people. I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all-and-as-long-as-its-from-redmond-anyways type of economy. I&#180;ve been doing OpenDoc demos to Microsofts corporate customers (not technology geeks, but IT managers of major banks and corporations) and they got it. OpenDoc did not fail in the marketplace. It was never allowed to enter the marketplace. And the beauty if it was that if you wanted to do a Content Management System OpenDoc style, you did not need to make the content handlers for all the datatypes nor the distribution protocols, sometimes not even the user interface. You could use someone elses. Painlessly.<p>

I think the Apache folks get this. Their architecture is open, ready to be extended by anyone needing something badly enough. If you need http handling, that is what it does. I think you understand it what with XML-RPC and SOAP and all those open protocol standards. I think it is far too progressive for Microsofts corporate culture. <p>

I like the fact that Frontier has an http Server integrated. This also has a flipside, however. It is very hard for example to just use a part of Manila inside another web-application. If you want to extend Manila, there is no choice but to learn Frontier scripting.<p>

<I>They're doing the wrong model, everywhere, except at Microsoft and UserLand. Why do you think Bill Gates is jumping up and down so much. He gets it. Who else does??</I><p>

Apparently, I am not. I think your economic, technological and ethical models are quite different from Microsofts. Maybe your "partnership" with Microsoft is of a more enlightening and empowering level than their relationship and attitudes towards their users and customers?<p>

Excel simply is a shitty piece of software. Why has there never been a better spreadsheet? There have been several. But Microsofts economics killed them. The victims were the users whose life is more miserable as a consequence. Do I think Microsoft should suffer for that? They have given me a pretty nice Internet Explorer for the Mac to make up for their earlier blunder. It is fast, renders HTML like you would expect and it crashes quite frequently. If I used it once per session, other applications I run behave strangely. Can other applications share the HTML rendering code?<p>

Cheers,<p>
