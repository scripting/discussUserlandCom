Bernie told me about the one that Matt Daw put together for him, and I asked for a screen shot.<p>

<b>DeepFun.Com Admin Page</b><p>

<b>The server log</b><p>

On the left side, going down a few screen fulls is a view of the server log, showing the IP address, or for people with membership cookies, a link to their profile page. The asterisk in each row is a link to the referrer page. Also note that the server has been up since 4/1/99! I liked to see that.<p>

<b>Site index</b><p>

This allows Bernie to "promote" a DG message to be a story that he can edit thru the DG interface. Stories can appear in as many <a href="http://www.deepfun.com/discuss/list/topics">categories</a> as he wants. This is simply an interface onto the <alsoListedIn> attribute of a DG message.<p>

<b>Delete message</b><p>

This one's pretty simple. He enters a msgnum and the message is deleted. Every sysop needs one of these!<p>

<b>Uploading a picture</b><p>

Thru this form Bernie can upload an image to the server.</img>
