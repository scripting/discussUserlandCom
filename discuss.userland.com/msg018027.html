"We will run this with the same kind of openness that we've run the Windows effort, but we will dramatize those even more. For every component of the .NET platform we will run design previews, with literally hundreds of software developers, and information technology specialists to preview, to understand what we're doing, to critique it, to give us feedback.<b>I'll talk a little bit about our involvement with XML, so far, but certainly the kind of work that we've seen from Dave Weiner, from Don Bocks, from others, just in participation in the development of the SOAP specification, has been really amazing and really valuable.</b> And we need to rev up that engine in a variety of ways."<p>


Emphasis added by me.  Mispelling of Dave's name is complements of whomever at MS did the transcript.
