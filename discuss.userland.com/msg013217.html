Take a look at <a href="http://www.mklinux.org/">MkLinux</a> vs. <a href="http://www.linuxppc.org/">LinuxPPC</a> in the Mac market.<p>

While they play nicely together, there are enough differences between the two that there's little chance of a full merge. Especially since the nicest feature of MkLinux is support for some "special" Apple hardware (the Nubus PowerMacs, most notably), which just isn't the kind of thing you can easily graft into LinuxPPC.<p>

The split is probably a good thing, though. It allows MkLinux to hang out, with continued support for the older hardware, while LinuxPPC continues to support new hardware, without worries about breaking the older, and very different, machines.<p>
