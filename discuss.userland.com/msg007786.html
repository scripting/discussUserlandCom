perhaps the user information could be stored in a formalized XML format, just a basic set of identifying fields. Then each site that wants to make use of the information provides a set of prefs (a table in Frontier-speak) with a unique site identifier. Then when the user visits /. or reads /. stories on my.userland.com, the site id is matched with the news source, and the prefs some into play.<p>

these are only a few technical thoughts. each site would have to decide how their content is actually personalized, i think.<p>

thoughts?<p>
