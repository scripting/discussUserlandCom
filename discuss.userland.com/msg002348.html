From Mauro Morandin in Venice: "It says that an American company who's name is Adrical has bought the basketball team of Trieste. The big Boss of Adrical is Frank Garza and his technological genius is Marc Canter. He is said to be a Schwarzennegger of the "bit", some sort of software guru, who is going to build a multimedia playground and business  center with lots of technology around the two stadiums where the basketball team plays."<p>
