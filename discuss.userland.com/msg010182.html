I agree this is a nice feature - but not worth $3500 (minimum). I think people simply will not need it that much - and while it can make the web richer - it will be limited to those who do not have to reduce costs. If Macromedia would offer it at a cheaper price I think people would think about it.<p>

Designing such things is a strange thing: You may want to play around with Generator and finally come to the conclusion, that you should use a different method. I won't pay $3500 for this test.<p>

I know of high-performance commercial projects which use ImageMagick to generate images from templates. Other people swear GIMP will solve all you can imagine for images. Both are freely available for commercial users.<p>

And if you use a Mac you may rather consider Script Photoshop or use ImageReady.<p>
