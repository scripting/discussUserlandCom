Wouldn't it be great to have these hook into Frontier! ... </i><p>

With Frontier's XML-RPC abilities, and the recent developments in Perl and Python for doing XML-RPC, I think the only thing left is:
<ol>
<li>a Perl/Python/whatever script to send the outline to frontier</li>
<li>someone to write a Frontier method to walk a THINK XML tree and build the Frontier outline from it.</li>
</ol><p>

Sounds imminently do-able!<p>

I checked the Frontier <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/">xml site</a> and I can't find anything about encoding Frontier outlines as XML. Can anyone tell me what happens when you send an outline as a parameter for an XML-PRC call? I guess I'm asking if anyone has developed a standard Frontier outline - XML conversion. This would be very helpful in developing a Frontier -> THINK connection...<p>
