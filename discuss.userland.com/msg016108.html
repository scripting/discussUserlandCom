<a href="http://www.vault.com/">The Vault</a>, a high end staffing firm, makes its living, in part, by providing content and capturing detailed resume data from the career-minded for employers. They are <a href="http://dijest.editthispage.com/community/VaultMemberDirectory">trying to change</a> their inventory of registered users into a community by: <ul>
<li>creating a directory, <li>implementing a matching system so peers can find others with similar interests or occupations, and <li>running chat/DG services. </ul>They now have the enormous challenge of changing partipant behavior. <p>

The UserLand world is already a vibrant community. We talk, shout, whine (off in a corner), post, weblog, crosslink, mail, celebrate. Can we beef up the <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/profiles/">/profiles</a> system to create a basic, searchable people directory? across all the UserLand hosted servers? eventually allowing syndication of user selected content to and from the directory? people.userland.com? userlanders.com? I'd love to use it. <p>

I wanted to look up friends of UserLander when I went on my March trip to Switzerland, London, and Netherlands. Beyond posting my travel intentions, it would have been cool to correspond directly with potential RL friends.
