This, and your other points are well-taken. I would add, though, that it might be wize to start small (prototype), and buy a large number of machines incrementally. In the PC market, the machines you bought last quarter might not be available this quarter, or a technology spurt changes your price/performance enough to go for a different box (or even class of box).
