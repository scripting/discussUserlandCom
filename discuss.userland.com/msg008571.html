I helped develop the concept and a quickie list of capabilities. After working with Frontier for so long, I knew I wanted to include a lot of the features I've become accustomed to in Frontier: discussion groups, news sites, search, etc... So, the short list of requirements had all those things. Naturally Frontier was the ideal environment to demo in! I don't know if we'll stick with Frontier or not, but I think Frontier will set a pretty high standard.<p>

I'm hacking into the system a bit, since I'm going to need multiple discussion groups, membership groups, consoles, etc. I'm pushing for an environment where each project team and department has their own, membership-controlled discussion group and newssite, with each project manager having a console from which to drive his area. I'll be extending console.root, and some of the others, a lot. On top of all this, the &quot;home&quot; page of the intranet hopefully will be a portal, customized by the user, with each project having its own channel.<p>

I have to give a <i>LOT</i> of credit to David Theige who paved the way with Andr&eacute; for doing <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5101">multiple membership</a> groups. David did a lot of digging, and I'm building on his work. <b>Thanks David!</b><p>
