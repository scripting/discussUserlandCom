The URL is as you say. If you save an outline at the top level of the www folder, say foo.xml, it's url will be:<p>

<a href="http://127.0.0.1:80/foo.xml">http://127.0.0.1:80/foo.xml</a><p>

If you're running on a port different from 80, of course, that part of the URL will be different.<p>

Note that as of 7.0b1, you can only serve XML files from that folder, but next week we're going to make the server fully general. I decided that we want a full HTTP server there, not just one that serves XML.
