you are right. the troubles were caused by a corrupted discuss.root. i replaced it with a new one and everything works fine again. this is really a big problem that corrupted frontier root-files are not disfunctional immediately i had similar problems with downloaded root-files. it would be cute to have a control checksum or something like this that informs you wether a root is functional or not.
Actually i use the roots size  that i compare to the size of a reference file. 
yes,yes, dig we must<p>
