But do those postings help, in the larger view?  Do any of us claim to have the "right" answer the first time, or do these sorts of postings lead to discussions and more thorough thinking-through of topics?  Hey, you (the generic <i>you</i>) may have the right answer, but if it's not understood - because I'm (the generic <i>I</i>) too stupid or busy to think it through, is there a posability that your re-explaination will not only help me understand it but also make it clearer for others?  <p>

I think so.<p>

But then again, I'm not prefect.  or even perfect.
