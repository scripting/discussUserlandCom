Having installed various different versions of Linux over the last couple of years, let me offer this advice: Have fun.<p>

Linux is at once a joy to use and a pain to configure. No doubt one critical piece of hardware won't be recognised. Or your Linux box will refuse to talk to the rest of your network. Or something else. maybe it will all work correctly. Don't be afraid to break the OS. You can always reinstall - it's all a learning process.<p>

The important thing is to enjoy yourself. Make the installation a fun project apart from your real work. Construct your experimental sites in your spare time. <p>

Don't count this project as work. Then, when you come up with something really cool it will be all the more rewarding.
