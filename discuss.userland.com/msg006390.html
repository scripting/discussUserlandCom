(Note that Open Transport, which is licensed from Mentat, is also gone from MacOS X.) I think this is a wise idea, because Apple doesn't know what the future will bring. Maybe they'll want to Open Source their entire OS at some point. Or maybe they'll want to give it away for free. Outside licensed code can be a real problem there.
