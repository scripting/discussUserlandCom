It seams that after removing them you need to compile the script, to make the change stick.<p>

Now I'm poundering if this is a problem. I know that agents sometimes are uncompiled to prevent them from running. <p>

Is there other resons for a script to be uncompiled?<p>

Is there any way to test if a script is uncompiled?<p>
