hmm.  I thought win32s was a package that let you run 32-bit applications on Windows 3.1, and now you're saying that it was
something that let you port 16-bit applications the other way?<p>

and I also seem to remember that I ported stuff from win16 to
win32, but I don't recall rewriting much of it...<p>

guess I'm growing old ;-)
