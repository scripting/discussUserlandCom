<p>This is a real problem. The answer is the creation of infomediaries; firms to whom you
entrust your data and who put it use for you. </p><p>

<p>Likely commercial infomediaries: <p>

<ul>
  <li>Intuit (who have much of your financial info already courtesy of Quicken and Quickbooks)</li>
  <li>Visa, MasterCard, AmEx and other credit card companies (who can combine credit line with
    ship-to addressing)</li>
  <li>FedEx, Visa, USPS, and other shipping companies (who know where you live and work, and
    when you come to the door). </li>
</ul><p>

<p>Another way: <a href="http://www.gator.com/">Gator</a> gives you a browser companion
that fills out the forms from data stored on your hard drive. Gator makes money from
promotions and data aggregation. We can expect the list above to make theirs by selling a
data-fullfilment transaction to vendors. </p><p>
