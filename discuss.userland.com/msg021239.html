Would a small note on Scripting.com regarding the developing until 10 PM nature of the Scripting News be useful?  The interface of Scripting.com does not make that nature of the writing clear (to me, at least).  I don't want to tell you how to operate the Scripting News, but I hope it is okay to ask about this here.
