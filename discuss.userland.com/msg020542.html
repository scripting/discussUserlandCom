Are there any alternatives out there to Pyra? If you haven't heard of Pyra, it's a collaborative web-based project management system. Blogger was an off-shoot of this product, and unfortunately Pyra (the company) has ceased working on Pyra (the product) to focus on the much-sexier Blogger product. The Pyra beta site (<a href="http://beta.pyra.com">http://beta.pyra.com</a>) is still active, but I'm loathe to use it for new projects since it's future is a big fat question-mark.<p>

I need a product that will let me coordinate projects with folks in diverse locations. I'm a road-warrior based out of Germany, most of my team is in Boca Raton, and we have a large development group in Orem as well. Need to be able to handle feature requests / additions, bugs, generic tasks, and notes / documentation. Must have the ability to assign any of those items to an individual. Must have an audit trail for any changes made to an item.<p>

I don't need source control, messaging, or any other "fluff", just pure project-management. The solution must be web-based. Prefer something self-hosted on NT/IIS, but I can deal with Apache on BSD or Irix.<p>

Any ideas / pointers are greatly appreciated.<p>

Thanks,<p>
