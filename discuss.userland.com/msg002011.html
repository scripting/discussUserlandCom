The import script created a table per record and each field went into a sub-item.<p>

<pre>
<b>Specs:</b>
- The raw text file is 14.473kB
- Resulting GDB is 50.041kB
- Frontier 5.1.5 w/ mainresponder (everything current)
- Dual PII w/ 512MB Ram
- NT 4.0, SP3, OP<p>

<b>Observations so far:</b>
- The script took 568 minutes to execute
- There was no additional load on the machine
- Normal memory usage is around 60MB
- During import the usage built up to 419MB
- This memory was not released after the script finished
- Record lookups via mainresponder took between 100 and 300 ticks
- Restarting Frontier released all the memory
- Record lookups via mainresponder are now at 14 ticks average
</pre><p>

The script looped over the file with file.readline, processed the line and checked against file.endOfFile.<p>

How does Frontier deal with the memory used during and after execution of scripts?<p>
