I just did a quick scan, and there are a couple of things that you should block from the outside world. (From outside your netblock). These are services that are useful but somewhat insecure on a local net, but are dangerous when exposed to the outside world. <p>

Check out tcpwrapper  (man tcpwrapper) or ipfwadm to block access to the rsh service (port 514), rlogin (port 513), lpr (port 515) and xWindows (port 6000).<p>

If you have questions, feel free to ask.
Welcome to the linux world.<p>
