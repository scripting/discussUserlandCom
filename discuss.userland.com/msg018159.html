My thoughts...<p>

We are a Microsoft shop, writing business-level COM components in Java using VJ++, and we love the Java/COM integration.  Before (about a year ago), I was heads down in C++/ATL development with another company.  At first I was disgusted with this announcement, but the more I read the spec, the more I like it.  Who's to say this C# spec can't take off?  IMHO, if the open source community had given birth to this spec, it would have met with a completely different response from the programmer community.  Take a look at the language wrt its merits solely as a language.<p>

I completely agree, having just recently discovered <a href="http://www.objectspace.com/jgl/prodJGL.asp">ObjectSpace's free JGL container/algorithm Java library</a>.<p>
