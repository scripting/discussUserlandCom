I've played around with the website framework for quite a while, and now you're getting me excited about digging into the docs for betty and xml.<p>

I want to use Frontier 6 for a couple of upcoming projects, but before I can estimate costs I need to know what can be done with just a browser, and which tasks require Frontier at the workstation.<p>

I know that I can post messages to the DG with just a browser, but I need Frontier to edit outlines and add items to the news page.  <p>

How about editing a page in the website framework, or adding a new page?  This is a task that everyone in an organization should be able to do, but we can't afford to buy that many copies of Frontier.<p>

Does the console work at all without a copy of Frontier present?<p>

Can non-sysops designate the #alsoListedIn directive, e.g. to add their posting to their home page, or to a project page?
