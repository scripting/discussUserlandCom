I'm having some weirdness with the calendar, though. If I log directly into a particular day, say <p>

<a href="http://www.myserver.edu/news/nahenahe/1999/04/01/">http://www.myserver.edu/news/nahenahe/1999/04/01/</a> <p>

it works fine, all of the other days links work great. However, if I log into the default page, <p>

<a href="http://www.myserver.edu/news/nahenahe/">http://www.myserver.edu/news/nahenahe/</a> <p>

the links don't work. It eliminates the news/nahenahe/ and the links point straight to a date structure:<p>

<a href="http://www.myserver.edu/1999/04/01/">http://www.myserver.edu/1999/04/01/</a><p>

and of course, there is no object there.<p>

I set the urlprefix to "news/nahenahe/", but when I do that, and then go to another date, it has this string twice, "news/nahenahe/news/nahenahe/" in the URL.<p>

I'll email you privately the url of the server if you want to take a peek.<p>

Aloha,<p>
