<ol>
<li>We host a lot less sites on the big pipe, so your site is going to be fast.
<li> We are based in Munich, Germany, so there may be performance bonuses if you are targeting a german audience
<li> We offer Domain Name Service and Mailservers alongside of Manila Sites
<li> We offer a web promotion system which gets you on top of the search engines, guaranteed.
<li> We offer consulting and design services and also programming expertise
<li> We offer support in German and also would like to make the editorial sites speak German.
</ol>
We do have a slight disadvantage compared to ETP which is that we pay per volume and not a small amount either.<p>

All in all I would be very happy to have the whole thing pay its bills soon.<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
