Try this:<p>

Explorer /root, "somepath"<p>

Where, of course, you replace "somepath" with something useful to you.  Naturally this can be entered in the Start/Run dialog, made into a shortcut, or better yet, a start menu item (which is just a shortcut in a special directory).  Yes, those commas are in the command line.  Go figure.<p>

You may also find the /e option handy, which gives you the two-pane explorer with a treeview and listview, rather than just the listview.
In other words:<p>

Explorer /e, /root, "somepath"<p>

In some of the Explorer and/or Windows enhancement packs like Microsoft PowerToys, you'll find a shell extension called "explore from here" - if this is installed, you can right-click on a directory and select "explore from here", and then you'll get a new explorer window with that directory as the root.  <p>

I'm still looking for the perfect explorer replacement... If you have some time to burn, look at <a href="http://www.winfiles.com/apps/98/explorer-replace.html">http://www.winfiles.com/apps/98/explorer-replace.html</a><p>

Also, if anyone has a favorite explorer replacement or filemanager, I'd love to hear about it (including *why* its your favorite.  <p>
