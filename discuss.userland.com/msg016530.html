Marc and I talk, in a kind of relaxed way. He said: "What will I panic over now that the seder is over?" I used his web browser, and noticed that he had Good Morning Silicon Valley bookmarked.<br><br>Interesting, I said, let's go <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/reports/gmsv/">there</a>. I scanned it, and my eye caught this <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/ericRaymondHubris.gif">quote</a> from Eric S Raymond. What was that doing there? What bluster. Yuck. "God'll get him for that," I said. I think that was a big line in <i>All in the Family.</i> Just curious, did the editor put that there because it was so blustery, or because he believed it?<br><br>BTW, when Doc Searls <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2000/04/21/searls/searls.html?page=2">calls</a> for an end to intellectual property, this is where he and I depart. It is not morally wrong for me to "own" my writing, whether it be software or prose. Otherwise there could be no free speech, as soon as I wrote something someone else would take it and say they wrote it. How could we ever communicate? I'm sure Doc meant it in a thoughtful challenging way, "here think about this." I'm not so sure about Raymond, he seems to be a true zealot. <br><br><a href="http://wwwsecure.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">First Amendment to the US Constitution</a>: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."<br><br><a href="http://davenet.userland.com/stories/storyReader$577">9/10/98</a>: "There's the bug!"<br><br>I have more work to do today on Scripting News via email. The mails didn't go out last night at 10PM. I think I know why. In the meantime, I keep thinking of more 1-Click type ideas. You want to know what I'm doing with them? I'm implementing and shipping them.<br><br><i>I removed comments about patents that were here this morning. I want to give it more thought.</i><br><br>
