I can put a web server in a much smaller computer than I can put a current java implementation. (seems wierd, but I guess that's just the state of the vm's.)  The xml-rpc idea gets it to be platform agnostic, as opposed to java platform.<p>

I think that what I want it to do could be done outside the java platform more easily than from within java.  What I'd like to see is to be able to tell the system: Bus 15(express), southbound, intersection: xth & yth.  Then the system sends a lightweight message: bus 15e(s) is at <a href="mailto:intersection@ ">intersection@ </a>xxam to my server whenever that pair of conditions are met.  My server intreprets that message and does something with it, either plays a sound, pops up a dialog, pages me, or whatever.<p>

Basically, I don't want to do the monitoring of the bus position, I want a computer to do it for me. <p>

Since I'm already running the server, presumably I've already figured out how to get a http post through it.<p>


You know, it might be even easier than that.
Just have the bus server:<p>

GET <a href="http://myserver/buslocation.cgi?15e/southbound/15th/65th/8.00am">http://myserver/buslocation.cgi?15e/southbound/15th/65th/8.00am</a><p>

when the bus passes 15th and 65th.<p>
