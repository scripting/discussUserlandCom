This is a perfect example of someone having a completely self-contained discussion. It's amazing to me how honest people are when they're doing this. He says "I guess I must be one of your idiots." If you keep guessing you'll never get closer to the truth. Try asking. Use the scientific method when dealing with people.<p>

Now, pretending you were asking instead of telling me what I think, Clinton is a jerk, not the root of all evil. We, collectively, were idiots when we believed that an undermined president could effectively lead us. I never said Stan Purington is an idiot, so forget being insulted. It's not real. I never once thought of you as idiot. I put my right hand up and swear on Murphy's Law.
