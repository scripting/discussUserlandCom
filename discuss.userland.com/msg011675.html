It seems to me that it is easy to describe the spirit of the law in terms reasonable people understand (copyright prevents unauthorized distribution or appropriation, beyond the very limited levels of "fair use"). Unfortunately, from a legalistic standpoint, spirit is not good enough. Legalism tends to rely on technical definitions. When the technology moves so fast, legalism can't keep up.
