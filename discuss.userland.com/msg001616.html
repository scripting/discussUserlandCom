Yep, lying makes me furious these days, and God knows I've done my share of it. No I haven't joined a cult or some new relegion or 12 step program. Here's what happened: I suddenly started noticing how MUCH dishonesty there is. I've been fortunate to know some really wonderful, honest people in my life but nowdays I look around me and they are the exception to the rule. While I've been working on being more honest, the people around me seem to have embraced deception. <p>

This makes me angry! <p>

You said something that I think explains why I don't like intentional lies. Someone who lies to me intentionally insults my intelligence. For some reason I respond strongly to that, with anger. It's not that I think I'm that smart. Just I'd rather have the opportunity to hear and discuss the truth. <p>

Is it wrong to get angry about being lied to/misled? If more people got angry, would there be more truth? Or just more angry people?<p>
