A group of developers was going to change RSS, that's a given.  As such, the question is not "what right did they have" (or if it still is, then you can provide that answer for us).<p>

The issue surrounds technical direction.  The question is more like "When a handful of developers disagree, by what right does one group claim to set the direction."  In this case, right or wrong, it seems like a simple majority was their thinking.
