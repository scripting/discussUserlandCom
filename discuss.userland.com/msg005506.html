And trust the universe, leadership counts for something, maybe a lot. If we show the browser vendors how to connect to servers at a higher level, the world will start to reshape around your vision.<p>

Remember, in today's economy, it's possible to sell out for hundreds of millions of dollars just because the CEO of a super-rich company "fell in love with the management team."<p>

When we release myUserLand.root we'll be putting unique value out there that you can't get anywhere else. There's a good chance that we're shooting ourselves in the foot by doing this. <p>

Further, you asked for and received help from the people in this community to get that code working, it's only fair that you share the result.<p>

A simple sample app that communicates with one of our XML-RPC servers would do the trick. Maybe a thousand flowers would bloom. And a thousand people would understand what Broadband Mechanics is doing. That couldn't hurt?
