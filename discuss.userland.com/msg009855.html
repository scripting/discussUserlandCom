In this aspect discuss.userland.com is an example of an open sourced book about Frontier (and associated subjects). Userland provides the space, some rules and are active participants, but most of the content is written by users.<p>

Combined with the search engine the result is one of the most useful books on Frontier you can find. I actually find more answers to my questions in discuss than in docserver.
