Why not ride that wave and call it the Weblog format?</i><p>

I knew that question would come up. I'm open to suggestions, and can implement anything, but if we're going to go to the trouble of having a new name for the format, I want an interesting one, and I want to get Lawrence Lee and Wes Felter's input on this too. Maybe <newsSite>? As others have pointed out "weblog" is confusing, and I find it unexciting. I am not a weblog, we carry unique content, there's a lot of judgment in what I do. A log is something a computer generates, or at best a scientist working in a laboratory.<p>

BTW, I have a theory about why Netscape didn't see the "fat" item opportunity. You have to approach the problem from the other side to see it. You have to be writing for the web and reading from the web to get it. If you approach it from actual use, you immediately see why the problem needs solving, it can't just wait for version 8.2.
