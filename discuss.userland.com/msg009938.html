It's amusing, you say "Ooops", I say "neat feature" (and it is a feature, one of the explicit choices made in design). <p>

I don't mind you stating your opinion at all, and I enjoy your comments. So you don't like Perl's design, and it's open source. It's also one of the most successful languages in existence. How does this jibe with your comments on Open Source and quality? Are you saying Perl is a poor-quality language? What does that mean? Is it designed poorly, is it implemented poorly, does it work poorly?
