It would save we Scripting News addicts a lot of time and click-throughs during the day... though we wouldn't get to see all the editing in semi-real-time.<p>

On the somewhat related matter of HTML e-mail, I have a question: How do you do it? Is it a matter of tweaking a mime-type in Sendmail somewhere, or properly formatting the message, or what?
