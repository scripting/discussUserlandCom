(at least for updating certain sorts of databases)<p>

I maintain <A HREF="http://www.flutterby.com/">my blog</A> via e-mail, I use a tool called <A HREF="http://www.flutterby.com/software/newwwsboy/">newwwsboy</A> which I wrote in Perl. I'm a big believer in "no new user interfaces", so it tries to take the exact same "check out this link" sort of messages that I had been sending to friends and turn them into HTML.<p>

Thus far I've depended upon security through obscurity, if someone malicious wanted to look through mail logs (or even the sent mail folders) on any system I update it from I'd be hosed, although in almost two years that hasn't happened (I have given some of the magic addresses to a number of friends). And to do this otherwise a cracker would have to search Flutterby.com's e-mail name space by trial and error, something I think I'd notice.<p>

I try to do as little of my leisure computing on Windows as possible, but a little time with Frontier and Pegasus (or whatever else, I just know I could do it in Pegasus) and you should be able to do something similar. RFC-822 compliant (or even close) messages are easy to get the text out of.<p>

If RSS is your end goal and you're a Un*x weenie, I've also got a <A HREF="http://www.flutterby.com/software/scripts/myns_pl.txt">really gross Perl script to make RSS files from HTML</A>, which I keep promising to rewrite the correct way and generate Scripting News and Whump XML (and whatever other formats I can get my hands on). But, of course, if you're going with Frontier it's probably got a much cleaner method of generating this stuff.<p>

And on databases which do e-mail responses to search queries, I played with that stuff way back in the FidoNet era, nowadays it'd be minutes worth of work to write a hack to take a query, munge it into SQL, dump it to a database, and generate a reply with the database response.
