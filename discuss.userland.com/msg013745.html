<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,33151,00.html">Richard Stallman</a>, a leader in the Unix world, calls for a boycott of Amazon.Com. "Please do not buy anything from Amazon until they stop using this patent to threaten or restrict other Web sites." <p>

I agree. I can live without 1-Click ordering. I can't support what Amazon is doing. Please join me in telling Amazon and other predatory patent holders that it's a bad idea to use patents as a competitive weapon.<p>

Jason Levine: <a href="http://q.queso.com/stories/storyReader$44">Of Manila and Portability</a>. "This is a quick missive about the process of moving a Manila or EditThisPage site -- things to think about while designing the site in the first place, all the way through things that you need to do once the site is on its new foundation."<p>

OK OK <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1501391.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif.1005-200-1501391">now</a> I have to find a town that's willing to rename itself Scripting.Com. <i>Any takers?</i><p>

<a href="http://cuwu.editthispage.com/1999/12/11">John Marden realizes</a> that he has Dilberts in his class. (For some reason I think Kate Adams would like this site.)<p>

<a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$66">surveys.root</a> is a Frontier 6.1 app. "Full source is provided."<p>

I'm testing a new <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/stories/storyReader$184">weblog ad server</a> that uses JavaScript, no cookies, and should work (fingers crossed) in most browsers. If you're including weblog banner ads on your site, please check it out.<p>

I added <a href="http://test27a.userland.com/report/">impression and click tracking</a> to the new server and reset all the counters. <p>

Hey the <a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/categories/">category browser</a> is filling out, and even better, mistakes are being fixed. It's like an ant farm. It has a life of its own. <i>Excellent!</i><p>

Lots of new stuff coming in the next few days as we empty the pipe for the 1900s and look forward to the 2000s.<p>

11 Days to Y2K. <i>Wow!</i><p>

<a href="http://surveys.userland.com/run/dave@userland.com/theNextPresident">Survey</a>: If the 2000 US presidential election were held today, who would you vote for?<p>

<a href="http://surveys.userland.com/run/dave@userland.com/isBushDisgusting">Another survey</a>: Is George W. Bush disgusting?<p>

Initial results look pretty bad for George W. <p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13748">An idea</a>: I'd like to send surveys to cellphones!<p>

<a href="http://www.bradlands.com/">Brad Graham</a> has a good idea too. He wants to hijack the Taco Bell slogan "Drop the Chalupa" because he doesn't like the stupid dog. I, on the other hand, still <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews#stupidDog">like the dog</a>.<p>

<a href="http://q.queso.com/">Jason Levine</a> has moved his EditThisPage.Com site to his own server, validating that the process of <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$1019">moving a site</a> works. We'll work with him on redirecting his original site.<p>

NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/yr/mo/biztech/articles/122099outlook-comp.html">The PC Is Dead! The PC Lives!</a> "Hot Silicon Valley companies like Phone.com, the telephone Web browser company based in Redwood City, Calif., are reporting gleefully that beginning next year, almost half the cellular phones sold will come equipped with the ability to surf the Web."<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13739">Bob Frankston on WAP</a>. "The wireless world is going to fall short of its potential as long as we are stuck in the assumptions of the early 1900’s which assume that the wireless must be managed by assigning exclusive ownership of frequencies."<p>

Here's how <a href="http://www.keplers.com/bestsellers.htm#ourgift">Kepler's</a>, the Buck's of Bookstores, is differentiating from Amazon et al.<p>
