Sorry I momentarily took you off-course today. Somehow, many months ago I lost track of www.scripting.com and in my mind I thought it had been replaced with news.userland.com. Duh!<p>

That's why I thought the new test page was being served wrong. If it hadn't been for Dori's investigation and comments here, I would have gone on errantly.<p>

So now I'm straightend out. I have updated my bookmarks to reflect reality. Thanks Dori! :-)
