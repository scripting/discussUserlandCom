And how long would this take to implement?  In a UNIX environment, I'd guess minutes.  ASP has some problems dealing with math like that, but... even so, less then a day.<p>

It's not even worth somebody's time to bundle up a prepared solution and try to sell it!  At least not to large companies that ought to have at least one competent person on staff.<p>

Then again.... maybe I should.  Who knows what we could make them pay for a "secure" solution like this... just include a bit to pay off the local techies (keep them from complaining), so "everybody" wins... >:-)
