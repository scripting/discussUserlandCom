You then upload this report to Apple.<p>

It then analyzes the report you sent by hitting a database of the current Carbon spec, and emails you a snazzy report of your app's compatibility.<p>

So Carbon Dater doesn't really have to be up to date; all that really matters is that the database at Apple is current with respect to Carbon...
