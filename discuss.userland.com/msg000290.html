This message, for instance, is to a slightly larger audience, and I wouldn't have sent it directly to you because I need someone who thinks more like I do to jar my thinking loose...<p>

Thank you for "Two Wishlist Items", but I'm stuck on a couple of points, and since I suspect it's a "when all I have is a hammer everything looks like a nail" issue of perspective and being locked in my ways of thinking, I'd especially appreciate the input of the non-Dave folks here.<p>

On the first wish, "A common cross-platform scripting API": Isn't DAV the extended file system that should deal with server side storage of scripts and objects?<p>

Aaaand, I'm having trouble understanding why XML-RPC is needed to supplement CGI? Is removing the naming of parameters that important (parameter names seem to be the only additional info I'd need to build an XML-RPC to CGI script, which I may do as an exercise)?<p>

Those two would at least be a start.<p>

On the second wish, "High-level web content runtime for Linux", some background: Newwwsboy is the package (Perl script) I wrote to run Flutterby (<a href="http://www.flutterby.com/">http://www.flutterby.com/</a>), a web site inspired by Scripting News, with an e-mail interface.<p>

I'm two revs behind on the uploads (e-mail me if you want to run it, right now I provide my few users a *lot* of handholding), but as it sits on in my development directory it has templates, macros, rudimentary glossaries (although I'm still trying to figure out a good interface for updating them), but rather than trying to render an existing database I assume that the web site is the database and it's how I store and link the incoming data that counts.<p>

You've convinced me that I need to build some sort of generic change detection mechanism and store data in a couple of different types of repositories (standard Un*x e-mail files, SQL tables, XML and such) so that I can render to other formats, but I still don't grok why the object heierarchy is so much cooler than a flatter collection of tables. If someone out there can enlighten me, I'd really appreciate it, all the models I'm coming up with are network or relational rather than strictly hierarchical.<p>
