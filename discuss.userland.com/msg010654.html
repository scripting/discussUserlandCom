Personally, I find Postfix, UW-IMAP, procmail and Outlook Express (IMP when on the road) to be a very good solution. EVERYTHING lives on the server (except I haven't found a really good solution for address book yet; don't feel like setting up my own ldap server yet). <p>

The lag some people are talking about with IMAP is probably because they're doing it over a modem; on a decent connection (preferably, lan) it rocks.
