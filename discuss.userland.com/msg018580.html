Me, I sometimes click on Transfer, and see who's downloading songs from me. If they download a bunch of songs, I'll add them to my HotList, figuring that they have similar tastes.<p>

Another feature is instant messages. This is the first time I've ever chatted. I've never initiated a message, but I get a few a day from other people. Most people are either complimenting my collection, asking a question -- what's the best song by xxx -- or it's someone who knows I work for UserLand and they're just saying hi and thanks.<p>

And here's a bug -- the Napster search servers aren't linked together. If you can't find something, disconnect, then reconnect, and you may be able to find it. (Click on Help, then on the top 10 FAQ, for more details.)
