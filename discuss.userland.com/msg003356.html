Sounds like too much work.<p>

At the risk of sounding starry-eyed about Java, why not use this technology instead?<p>

And (yup, here it comes again) something like the <a href="http://www.operasoftware.com">Opera browser</a> lets you aim your <applet> tagging at the Java VM of your choice. For compatibility let's say the <a href="http://java.sun.com:8081/products/plugin/1.1.2/index-1.1.2.html">Sun Java plugin 1.1.2</a>. I still can't believe how well this works in actual practice now that I'm seeing it. ALL Java is running for me off the web. And new 1.1.7 based stuff of my own as well.<p>

Very soon I'll try to put the cash where my mouth is and code something. I'm deeply embroiled in straight C Quake2-engine game code now. Working on a serious project that a publisher is waiting for and all. It takes up all my spare time or I would be tinkering with this, honest.<p>

I want to hook up with Hannes soon and see what's what with this stuff. I'm intrigued with the whole thing and have this love/hate (mostly love) relationship with Java. :D
