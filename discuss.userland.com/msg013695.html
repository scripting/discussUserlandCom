I've written a <A HREF="http://www.flutterby.com/archives/1999_Dec/18_XMLforCalendars.html">proposal for XML calendars</A>. I'll try to whip together some data scrapers to give us some source material and perhaps an aggregate viewing CGI script today, but I'm primarily interested in feedback from people who are a little more ensconced in the XML lore about what I'm doing that could work better with others.<p>
