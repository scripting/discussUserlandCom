The page left behind at day's end? Does it promote specific writing styles? (The "What" of weblogging.) <p>

I'll hold my impressions for a few days to give you a chance to hear yourself write with MX&tm;. <p>

MX is revolutionizing my writing methods, the "How" of weblogging. Snap! and a retinal impression and a thought are posted on my site. I don't even have to go to my home page to preview or review! <p>
