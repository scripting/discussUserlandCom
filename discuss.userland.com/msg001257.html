I agree that Clinton has wronged our judicial system in a civil case.  He made additional mistakes in an attempt to hide the original error(one that I think many Americans would be guilty of if put in a similar situation.)  This is not a high crime, nor is sexual harassment.  Neither is an admirable quality in a leader, but I don't remember a politician worth admiring in my lifetime.<p>

I have already pledged that I will, for the duration of my life, vehemently oppose any person who votes yes on this proposition of impeachment. <p>

Not only will I not vote for these people, but I will use the considerable resources at my disposal to fund their opponents and keep them from getting elected.  Nor will I deal with any in business or do anything to profit this group of people in any way.  Not because I don't want Bill Clinton impeached, god I could almost care less about that, but because they are contorting our constitional system for their own ends.
