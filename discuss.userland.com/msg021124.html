No, I meant specifically to ask whether folks can cite that people have ever made <i>public domain</i> software proprietary.  There's a huge difference between public domain and open source.<p>

(I don't want to talk about open source politics. I only want to talk about public domain.  As the topic shifts to open source instead, I get disgruntled since I feel like a foil for someone else's propaganda.)<p>

Eric Kidd: <i>Such gratitude. This is basically why the GPL exists.</i><p>

I'm really pretty upset that my question was used to argue for the rationale of the GPL.  I'm trying not to let it get my blood up.
