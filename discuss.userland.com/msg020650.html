It can't reach out and grab your code.  If Dave were to release MacBird under GPL, without explicitly GPLing the Applet Toolkit, then the very worse thing that could happen is that he would have to relicense MacBird to another license, or remove it from distribution.  It really depends on the implimentation details.  <p>

As you said, the LGPL is the better choice for the Applet Toolkit if you wanted a GPLish license.  A BSD/X-ish license would work also.  <p>

A software license is only for OTHERS to follow.  It never applies to the copyright holder.  The only difficulty for a copyright holder is if there are mixed copyright to the code.  Then it requires agreement of the copyright holders.  <p>

About the LGPL, the Free Software community actively encourages you to use LGPL, any fleeting discouragement(even by the text of the license itself) is a pure Stallmanism.  He only grudgingly acknowledged the need for a different, and less restrictive, Library license.
