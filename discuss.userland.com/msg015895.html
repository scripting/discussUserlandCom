I was fiddling with IE/5 on the mac this weekend and I was actually able to make a usable outliner in the bowser. There are still quite a few work arounds in the code due to browser bugs - but we are finally starting to get DHTML support that make this stuff possible.<p>

I still can't get this to work nicely in IE/5 windows. I might need to use non standard approaches to get it to work there ....
