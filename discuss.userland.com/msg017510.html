Just FYI, some of the functionality that you're talking about in a phone-to-web app has been implemented by PageTalk (www.pagetalk.com). You might want to sign up, and play around with it. They use RA, and tack ads onto the end of messages, but it's free. 800# to update, etc. Perhaps a pay version of the system could eliminate the ads...
