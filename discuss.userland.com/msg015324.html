Also, something positive people can do. Create an intellectual property database like IBM's that documents unpatented prior art, so that lawyers defending against patent suits will be as well-armed as those on the other side.

A great idea: but any database has to be absolutely tied to the existing patents themselves to be an effective legal defence. Otherwise, you get dragged into having to <b>define</b> the technologies that products demonstrated, rather than just citing them as examples of prior art.<p>

How about thinking of each patent as a Manila story, where you get to see prior art as the "discussion" when you click on the cow-skull, together with commentary from the people who suggest them? A counterpunch for each blow issued by the Patent Office...
