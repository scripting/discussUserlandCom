If I have two desktop apps - A, X - and I want them to talk xml-rpc to one another - how do they use http to do it?  Do they have to go out to the net and come back? (I'm sure that's not it) Or is there some kind of tiny resident http server who manages all the calls? Or is it something that is built into each app?  How do the apps "listen" for http requests if there are many of them?  And what if I'm just on my own solo machine - how does http work there?
