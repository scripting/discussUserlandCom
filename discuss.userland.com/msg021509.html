There's a wonderful quote from Neil Stephenson's Diamond Age about this sort of thing.<p>

(from memory, spoken by the consultant just back from his last war)
<blockquote>
It's amazing how much money you can make shoveling back the tide. But then, there is no honor among consultants. In the end he will just go down as another 2 bit warlord that could't make the grade. </blockquote><p>

Of course, he wasn't talking about consultants to the computer industry, but than again, who knows. <p>

Or maybe it's not a related quote, but I still think it's cool. <p>
