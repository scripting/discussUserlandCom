Do you use a traditional PR firm? I've seen recent reports on how that old "Have I got a story for you, buddy" story/writer development process is beating out the news release. Cutting through what journalists perceive as a torrent of noise. Sorta high touch advocacy beating out generic business flack. btw, if you find a good firm, I'm shopping for one too. <p>

I've talked twice in two weeks with people who have personal PR agents. Objective: to create a reputation for themselves. Personal branding above and beyond their role or firm. <p>

I always thought that the personal and strongly voiced DaveNet functioned like a high touch form of gonzo PR. I have to believe that journalists subscribing were more likely to treat them as a valued and unique source of information than as one more news release buried among the 5000 news releases issued each week. <p>
