While it's perfectly legal XML, with escaped entities, etc., it's not clear what XML consumers of this data are supposed to do with things like &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; (which comes through most parsers as <i&gt;, of course). It just ends up being passed through to the viewer in the text, which looks weird.<p>

It's no problem to strip it out on the agent's end, but I just wanted to toss this on the table as a general philosophical issue. Specifically, does it make sense to pass HTML mark-up through to XML agents (if they aren't expecting it)? <p>

Short or full-blown style sheet support (not acceptable for lightweight agents), is there any alternative scheme for providing human-viewable styling on text otherwise destined for automated agent processing?
