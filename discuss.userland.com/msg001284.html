Tell the truth, of course.  Vitor, it's not like he hasn't had this come up in his marriage before.  He dorked plenty of women before Monica, including the star of Raven and that Gennifer Flowers woman.  He wasn't a saint in this arena, so why did he feel the need to lie about it and keep that lie going when it was readily apparent to everyone except him apparently that this was going to become a Big Issue?<p>
