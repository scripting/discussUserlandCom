I first opted to use an out of state DSL provider, and after they played around for 3 months I told them to get lost.  I then called up US West and had my modem AND service in under 2 weeks.<p>

THE NICE PART:  While US West gauruntees 256k speed on their DSL lines, depending on where you are in relation to the CO, it could be much faster as they don't limit their ISP bandwith per user.  My modem downloads AT 640k and sometimes jumps over 7-800.<p>

My modem uses DHCP, and I have 3 computers hooked up to the hub, and they all play nice together and share the connection very well.  <p>
