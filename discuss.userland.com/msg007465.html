I'll look into this. I was kinda hoping for something that I could just run on a mac that give a cleartext password would give me the encoded password. Something like htpasswd for the mac.<p>

I'd write some scripts in Frontier to automatically upload the .htaccess and .htpasswd files where needed automatically. <p>

Thanks for the info tho. I'll probably have to go that route.
