Word's outlining is cleverly integrated with the paragraph style mechanism. Reserved styles (heading 1, heading 2, etc) define a paragraph's hierarchy in the outline view. But this also allows for FORMATTING to be associated (automatically) with different levels in an outline. This greatly enhances its usefulness as a writing tool when you have long documents or documents with numerous levels of structure. You can reflect that structure by use of type size, spacing around paragraphs or text colour.<p>

You can also selectively show and hide outline levels down to a particular level (e.g. "show me just the chapter headings", "show me down to the subsection level only", etc). Another strong benefit when authoring and editing long documents with complex structure.<p>

Frontier's outliner doesn't have any mechanism for associating meaning with different levels of an outline (as described above).
