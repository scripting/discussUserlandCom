Not that that is bad or ineffective, just not quite the collegial, self-organizing community that it has been advertised as being. Now, the article is on the Lotus.com web-site, so draw whatever contextual inferences you may...<p>

>>Open Source Revisited
So, if the open source model is not a bazaar, what is it? To the certain consternation of Raymond and other open source advocates, their bazaar is really a cathedral. The fetchmail and Linux projects were built by single, strong architects with lots of help -- just like the great cathedrals of Europe. Beautiful cathedrals were guided by one person, over many years, with inexpensive help from legions of workers. Just like open source software is. <i>And, just as with open source software, the builders of the cathedrals were motivated by religious fervor and a divine goal.</i> Back then, it was celebrating the glory of God, now it is toppling Bill Gates.>><p>
