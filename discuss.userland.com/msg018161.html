Good point. <p>

I haven't given that much importance since they don't matter much in my application. My needs are structural. I need to set up specific chat sessions without any real prior communication. As for security, a big chunk of my job is to preserve the security of this data - to know when to listen and who it can and cannot be shared with. It's a trusted element of my job. The purpose of the chat channel is also specific. If it's used for other things, well... we do have usage guidelines to cover that.<p>

I would think that anybody wanting to use chat as a customer service tool would feel the same way. It's *not* an open channel to do anything you want. It's a specific service for a specific task.<p>

I don't think we can swap the open services like ICQ for the structured ones like I'm describing. I think that's part of the reason we haven't seen chat invade the corporate space much - the tools offer way too much freedom.
