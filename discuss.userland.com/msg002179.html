I agree that the information interchange areas become a little thorny as a result, but if you have fast base64 encoding/decoding it doesn't add much overhead. As we moved forward we checked with people on the xml-dev list and there was a consensus that we'd pretty much all be doing base64 before it was all over. I wonder if you agree? <p>

Also, to be claiming on our DG that you have better encoding before allowing us to respond is one of the ways we got in trouble in the past. As far as I can tell, www.wddx.org still has not been updated to reflect the information you have about simple object serialization. We, of course, have updated our site to point to yours..<p>

Yours in respectful coopetition,<p>
