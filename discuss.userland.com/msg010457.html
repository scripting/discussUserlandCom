Vanguard's terms of use (very strict):<p>

<a href="http://www.vanguard.com/site/copyright.html">http://www.vanguard.com/site/copyright.html</a><p>

Is Yahoo violating their "fair use" policy?<p>

I may not agree that the policy is fair (or even that it is enforcable), but it is their published policy.<p>

(Ooops...The link to their copyright notice violates the policy.  Don't click on that URL!  Go to <a href="http://www.vanguard.com/">http://www.vanguard.com/</a> and find their link to the policy ;)
