Remember, he is now on the board of VA Linux and therefore has a vested interest. In fact, when I spoke with him in mid-August he agreed, in front of everyone at the table, that he had a fiduciary duty to advance his company's interests and should not be seen as unbiased. He calls what he's doing "meme-hacking" -- a euphemism for propaganda.
<P>
Were he not involved with a Linux company, he might be willing to admit that the GPL's poison pill makes businesses unsustainable. Other licenses <i>do</i> allow companies to survive, but then, his company does Linux.
