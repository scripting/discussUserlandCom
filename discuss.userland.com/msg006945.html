People have to bring their minds with them. I really want to understand why people care about the things they do. And if they're just making conversation I need to know that too. In this case there was a lot of confusion over why the person cared about a tiny bit of storage on our server. I've been following this on other sites, like Yahoo. Try asking the question over there. They'll give you the same answer. It's unnecessary to build a whole human process for cleaning out dead accounts. There already are quite a few on our server. It's not something to worry about. Disk space is cheap, and a script can do it for us later. I'd much prefer (actually require) that this DG stick to technology issues, and stay out of the personal realm. That goes for me too. Key point, bring your mind with you, think before responding, ask yourself if you're adding value or taking up time and space.
