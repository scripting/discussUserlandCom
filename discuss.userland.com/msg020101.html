For example, AOL/Netscape is not generally considered an open source developer, even though they have released a major open source project, and Cygnus and RedHat are considered open source developers, even though they have non-open-source products.  I think it's both an attitude as well as hard code.<p>

Getting a little more fuzzy, there are degrees of open source <i>projects</i>.  There are still a few projects that release open source code, but where the project itself is open only to invited members (the "cathedral" model in <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar.html">TCATB</a>).  A common newbie technique for companies "testing the waters" with open source is also to release their code, APIs, or specs under an open or near-open source license, but keep the development close to or entirely internal to the company; these companies are often very surprised when their source gets forked (routed around) because they're unwilling to go a direction that a number of their users want to go.
