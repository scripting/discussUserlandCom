Back to your initial point about Baseball....Soccer is boring! (just a personal opinion--probably an "american" one).<p>

90 minutes of back and forth, back and forth, for what?  1-0 final...or worse yet 0-0, with overtime, and eventually the always unrepresentative penalty shots?  argh.<p>

I'll stick with baseball.<p>

And I don't think your point about the terminology is fair.  Every specialization has it's own terminology--just like us computer geeks can't be understood by most of the population when we get talking.  The terms work within the frame of knowledge...call it baseball-eze.<p>
