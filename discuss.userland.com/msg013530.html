The number one most requested feature is "Multiple Days on the Home Page." People also call this the "Just Like Scripting News" feature. <p>

<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$708">It's ready now</a>. "To display more than one day, change the number." And there's a new <a href="http://static.userland.com/editThisPageCom/images/newsDayTemplate.gif">template</a> that controls how Manila renders each day. This feature is available now on all UserLand-hosted Manila sites.<p>

BTW, Frontier 6.1 users can get the new Manila features by updating manila.root. Bring manila.root to the front and choose the Update command in Frontier's Main menu. It's the first command, so it's always easy to find.<p>

<a href="http://misnomer.editthispage.com/">Misnomer</a> and <a href="http://queso.editthispage.com/">Queso</a> didn't waste any time implementing the new feature. <i>Excellent!</i><p>

<a href="http://builderlive99.editthispage.com/">Phil Suh finishes</a> the Builder Live website with an ominous quote. "I spoke to a lot of different people about content management systems for websites. Everyone is in agreement, there is nothing good out there right now." <p>

Now you can <a href="http://dave.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$7">run surveys from pages</a> on EditThisPage.Com. Please read the docs carefully and understand the limits. It's a little awkard since the surveys are managed on a UserLand.Com domain and the pages are on EditThisPage.Com. Nonetheless, these are <i>interactive macros,</i> a first for Manila.<p>

You can now <a href="http://dave.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$7#optionalparams">change the colors</a> on surveys.<p>

It's always a good idea to <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/results/dave@userland.com/frontier61shipdate">review your surveys</a>, esp ones that asked people to make a prediction. BTW, the official shipdate for Frontier 6.1 was December 1. (65% chose Nov 25 or Dec 10.)<p>

If you have questions about using Manila, please post a note to the Manila-Newbies <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/list">mail list</a> or on the Manila-Newbies <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/discuss/">discussion group</a>. With over 400 new sites in the last week, it's impossible for me to help people directly, no matter how important their work is. Use the tools, let's build a community, it'll work much better that way. I don't like being a hard-ass, but this is one of those times when there's absolutely no other way to do it. Thanks for listening.<p>

"I'm not going to minimize my attachments by giving it all away, though, so you evangelists for a zillion worthy causes can just calm down out there and forget about hitting me up for megabucks. I am *not* going to be a soft touch, and will rudely refuse all importunities." <i>OK.</i><p>

A couple of sites complain that I'm watching them. I'll keep watching but I'll stop pointing. When you run a public website it's weird to complain that people are watching. (That's the point, isn't it?)<p>

"Zope's management environment pays for the flexibility of an 'Internet architecture' by being less productive than competitive 'thick-client' environments." Hmmm. Refreshingly honest! (We like thick clients, but we like thin ones too.)<p>

I'm having trouble figuring out what <a href="http://doid.editthispage.com/">Charlie Goodier</a> is doing on his site. It looks quite interesting.<p>
