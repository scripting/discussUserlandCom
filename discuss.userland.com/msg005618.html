If you want peace where your Italian family lives, start believing in the power of love instead of violence. Find things you can do to improve people's lives. Blowing up power plants and bridges in Yugoslavia is not improving anyone's life. The net improvement is negative. It's not helping any of the Kosovars. I challenge you to show me any way it's positive for anyone, except fulfilling some want of retribution. (A want I, for one, don't have.)<p>

Further, there are six billion people on the planet. Are you telling me, with a straight face, that we couldn't absorb two million displaced people? And, do we have a choice?
