>>But I really like the idea of reading books on a portable device that plays like a book. I can see a lot of advantages for people with aging eyes like mine. I'd like to make the type bigger, much bigger, then when I'm lying down I can use more positions and stretch my lower back while doing it, instead of having to remain in one of very few positions where my eyes can read the text. So thank you for the form factor, it's going to make a big difference.>><p>

I'm so glad to hear this point being articulated! I have argued with friends and family for years that e-books (and e-magazines, and e-reading in general) would be a desirable way to go when the pieces came together. One major problem of course is display resolution, and that is only improving rather slowly.<p>

But they would always say "but who wants to curl up with a computer"? My argument was that there would be specialized display types that would actually be more comfortable. I can easily envision a multi-axis, articulated e-book holder (very much akin to the fancy holders for flat-panel monitors) that would actually make reading an e-book in bed much MORE comfortable, because your arms would be free!
