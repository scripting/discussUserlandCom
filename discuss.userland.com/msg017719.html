A three-hour meal with drinks ended up costing a party of 13 about $90 a person [Ouch!]<p>

<A HREF="http://timeoutny.citysearch.com/timeoutny2/loc/Sammys-Roumanian.html">Sammy's</A> is one of those places that can create remarkable memories, but only at a cost. If you don't worry about money, then Sammy's is the place to be for any group outing. It's an amazing place. Singing waiters. A very drunk owner. Even more drunk party guests from other tables. I know of sales people who spend thousands of dollars at Sammy's to show their clients an amazing time, if only to get them to sign a million-dollar [or whatever] deal the next morning.<p>

In short, Sammy's is intoxicating.<p>

Oh yeah, and big big big big steaks on very hot plates.</a><p>
