Here are two examples, one from <a href="http://screenshots.userland.com/pictures/tomalak@dsoe.com/SearchEngineInterface.GIF/">Lawrence Lee</a> and the other from <a href="http://screenshots.userland.com/pictures/daniel@circumtech.com/mynewspage.gif/">Daniel Berlinger</a>.<p>

Wait there's more! <a href="http://screenshots.userland.com/pictures/lixianliu@hotmail.com/chineseDG.gif/">Lixian B. Chiu</a> shows us the DG doing Chinese text. And a Chinese <a href="http://screenshots.userland.com/pictures/lixianliu@hotmail.com/chineseSearch.gif/">search engine</a>! <i>Wow!</i><p>

<a href="http://screenshots.userland.com/pictures/pingel@digi-info.de/redaScreenshot.GIF/">Christophe Pingel</a> is working on an editorial system for a broadcast radio station's website.<p>

I'm so inspired! I just posted another <a href="http://screenshots.userland.com/pictures/dave@userland.com/memberData.gif/">screen shot</a>. This one shows what a user's member record looks like. Don't worry the password isn't for real. <p>

Here's my <a href="http://screenshots.userland.com/pictures/dave@userland.com/controlPanel5.gif/">latest control panel</a>. Note the angels (my new term for agents) and cowboys, and now there's even a turkey (this is where I go to see error messages). A new nomenclature. Who says web development can't be colorful!<p>

This is better than I had hoped for. People are reallly being creative. This is great. I want to show people how people are being innovative with Frontier, not just what Frontier looks like.<p>
