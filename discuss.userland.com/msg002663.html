Since you define the parameters that an XML-RPC handler accepts, you can define username and password parameters if you want. They can be encoded in any way you want, as long as the client knows how to encode them and the server knows how to decode them.<p>

In addition, in Frontier we have a convention, you can include a #security script that runs before a handler is invoked, allowing you to disallow access based on HTTP username and password, IP address, or whatever other criteria are available.<p>

So: while there's nothing in the spec about security, there's nothing to prevent you from implementing security however you want.<p>
