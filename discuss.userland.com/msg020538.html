Kinda like talking about how to design cars, not drive them.<p>

Rereading my original question it's obvious that this wasn't clear.  I can clarify by saying that I see three different sets of people who might have difficulty with XML Namespaces, but whatever difficulty is different for each:<p>

<ul>
<li>People who use namespaces in already defined XML formats (like SOAP or RSS1.0p).
<li>People who define new formats.
<li>People who write tools to work on specific formats or generic XML.
</ul><p>

If there's a direction I'm trying to lead, I <i>know</i> that there are highly (and unnecessarily?) complex examples of XML Namespace usage (SOAP, XML Schema).  But XML Namespaces can be used in a sane, simple, manner (RSS1.0p).<p>

I'm mostly interested in why people believe that simple usage of XML Namespaces is difficult.  The answer might well be the lingering fear that one <i>might</i> have to become a namespace-guru at some point in time to continue forward.
