Like every community there's the ranking thing, the place you want to be. Who's on top and who's the rising star? Our little den of RSS lovers is no exception. <i>"Black dirt live again!"</i><br><br>	Interesting thing about the hotlist, it recalcs every hour and is a function of who's logged in. (A login lasts 25 hours.) This morning I looked at it and my number had decreased from 11 to 7. Still tied for number one. <br><br>	BTW, we're going to release the source code for the cloud when it settles down so that all different kinds of communities can develop. It's all XML and XML-RPC/SOAP. I know of one developer working in Zope to parallel our development, and of course we welcome this.<br><br>	I can also see which categories of mine people have subscribed to. A lot of people have subscribed to Scripting and Frontier, but I rarely route stories to these channels. It's as if there's a small audience waiting. So I just routed <a href="http://www.webreference.com/dhtml/column46/">something</a> to Scripting, and am going to create some things to route to Frontier. Feedback in the form of a hotlist really helps. <br><br>	Another example of that is the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stats/referers">Referers page</a> for the XML-RPC site. As news of Eric Kidd's work spreads, the XML-RPC site is getting linked into more developer sites. And it distributes the flow to the implementors and they in turn point back to us. This is the Web doing its work, telling developers about good stuff they can use and in return encourages us to create more good stuff. <br><br>	Anyway, if the hotlist is such a good idea, then an <a href="http://www.userland.com/updates">Updates</a> page can't be far behind, right? Well, in the next level, the Updates page is much hotter. You don't get a list of sites that changed,  you get the bits from the sites, delivered into your template along with items from MacNN, The NY Times (we <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/rss/nytimes/technology.xml">got</a> it working!) and Salon, Herring, Wired and Fool, and a bunch of others. It's kind of a mix of chat, the Web, and mail lists. <br><br>	Who was it who <a href="http://www.thetwowayweb.com/payloadsforrss#aTouchOfGrey">said</a> "Everything on the Internet is just like something else. Or if it's any good it's just like <i>everything else."</i><br><br>	"curly"<br><br><b>Redesigns<a name="redesigns">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/23#redesigns" title="Permanent link to 'Redesigns' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Redesigns' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.news.com/">A redesign</a> at News.Com. As much as I like the design, I'd really like to see CNET support "RSS".
