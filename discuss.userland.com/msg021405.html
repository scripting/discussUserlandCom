Rules are orthogonal to OPML. They are carried in the content, not understood by or recognized by the format, it's an interesting idea, but I think would interfere with the transparency of the format. <p>

What we're going to look for are real server-side apps that render OPML documents that care about expansionState. Those guys will squeal loudly (I hope) and show us why it's important to add a common attribute.
