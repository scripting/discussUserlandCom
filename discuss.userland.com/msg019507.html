First, if you want to be my friend, don't tell me to write a DaveNet about anything. Even suggesting it is not a good idea either. It's my personal column, and I jealously guard it, I quit Wired over that issue, so..<p>

Now, I haven't written about Radio UserLand in DaveNet yet, because it isn't ready for them yet. It will be soon, I hope, but not yet.<p>

But how does it fit in? Well, the name of the company is UserLand. We make website software because that's the best way to empower users. We're in the route-around business. <p>

Well, music is another media type. A very important one. People thought we were crazy when we went to the Web in 1996. But it was the right move. This is the right move too.<p>

As to how music and writing connect, please allow me a little secrecy. For a couple of reasons. First, the thoughts are still in development, and the software will follow quickly after the thoughts are baked. The other reason is that we're in a competitive space, and I'd like to have a chance to be first to ship my ideas. But writing and music are very connected. Spend a half-hour on Google to get an idea about that.<p>

I will say this. The change that's happening now is so fundamental, we'll look back on the years before 2000 as being a mere warmup act for what's to come. The Silent Web. Look at how music transformed the movies. Reading with music? Ohhhh yeah! A big deal.
