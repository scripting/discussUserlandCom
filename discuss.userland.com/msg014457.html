Well, given that WINE is not one of those pieces....<p>

A lot.<p>

Think about the economics here. <p>

Linux has a small (growing) but vocal market share. LinuxPPC <i>Might</i> have 1% of the linux market. In my rough (wild ass) guesses, that would put the Frontier market on LinuxPPC in the tens of copies.  Maybe Hundreds if you're lucky. If it were a recompile from Linux/x86, I'd go for it. but it's not, since they're using WINE.<p>

I'd personally rather see Userland's effort go to other fronts. I'd like to see them do something completely new and mind blowing. (Again, They've done it a few times already)<p>
