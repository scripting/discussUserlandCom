You know, a better option might be to implement MacBird in Java, run it as an applet in your browser, and get the best of both worlds. Editing in your HTML page with the power of a MacBird UI. <p>

Dave, wasn't there talk long ago of a MacBird plug-in? A Java MacBird making RPC calls back to the parent server would be a cool variation on this, IMO. You could use the same card formats and everything, it's just be rendered in your browser window instead of a separate app.<p>

Were the MacBird card data formats ever documented for public consumption?
