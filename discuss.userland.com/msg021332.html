Anyway, here it is more appropriate:<p>

Not meaning to start a flamewar, but I definitely need an answer to this. I have been trying to contact Userland via the <a href="mailto:sales@userland.com">sales@userland.com</a> e-mail address, but haven't been getting any response. Unfortunately, Userland doesn't provide a phone number (which immediately precludes our Purchasing department from ordering Frontier). I have gone ahead, and ordered a copy of Frontier on my credit card, but, to date (almost a week) I have yet to receive the instructions on retrieving my copy of Frontier. <p>

I do know that my credit card has been charged. <p>

So, how does the one year subscription proceed? Does it go from the day my credit card was charged, or from the day I actually receive my copy of Frontier? If the former, well, I haven't had any Customer support whatsoever. What is the deal, Dave?<p>
