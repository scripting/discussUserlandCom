Please adopt the conventions of the weblog world. Archive your back issues in a calendar so others can point to back issues. It'll be good for your flow. We'd be happy to give MacInTouch a free license, with static rendering they'd give up nothing in performance and get a boatload of features that users really like. The links to "special reports" in the right column is a clue that they need more than this to make their site really work.
