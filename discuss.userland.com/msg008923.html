Should I run the Mac or Win version of Frontier to serve my web content?<p>


The Scenario:
I use Frontier as a CGI Scripting environment/tool only. With this tool I have created my own content management tool, with which I easily can create multi-lingual content for different groups of users.<p>

I would like to access the CGI with a call like this (as in Frontier v4 for Mac): www.mydomain.com/go.fcgi$pathargs<p>

I would like to access files on the HD (images, etc) with a call like this: www.mydomain.com/images/logo.gif<p>

In the CGI I very much use the (Macintosh) extensions 'datasortingKit' and the tokenizer function within the AppleScript OSAX 'ACME Script'.<p>

I expect a maximum of 1000 hits a day.<p>


The Mac Solution:
I suspect I can set up the envrionment like for Frontier v4; that is, with a webserver (WebStar) handling all 'file'-requests, and passing CGI-requests to Frontier.<p>


Other solutions:
Can I use Macintosh and skip the webserver at all, having Frontier handle it all?
How do I set up a Windows envirnoment for my needs; is it possible?<p>

Any input would very much be appreciated.<p>
