Boy you should see some of the mail that was waiting. The <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet">How to Make Money</a> piece reallllllllllly worked. Stay tuned. <p>

I had my <a href="http://macrobyte.net/people/seth/nikonshots/people/DaveW-SethD.jpg">picture</a> taken with Seth Dillingham yesterday, he's tall, so am I but I'm standing on my tiptoes in the pic. <p>

MacCentral has a <a href="http://www.maccentral.com/seyboldboston.shtml">special page</a> for Seybold press releases. Too bad they didn't send someone to yesterday's panel on standards hosted by Dale Dougherty of O'Reilly. I was on the panel along with two experts on XML and a fellow named Bierman from Adobe (no relation to our Bierman). Good news is that Adobe is going to be moving soon with software for Scalable Vector Graphics. And W3C has a proposal to make the web work like Third Voice. Oy. <i>The session was very lively!</i><p>

Industry Standard: <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,9599,00.html">FTC Investigates Alexa</a>. "Using a packet sniffer to monitor the data travelling between his computer and Alexa's servers, Smith discovered that his full home address had been sent to Alexa while he was using AltaVista's yellow-page service. He also learned that Alexa's servers had received detailed information from an airline ticket purchase he made on Travelocity, and a personal phone call he made to a relative in Florida."<p>

Last night's session was a lot of fun. I demo'd Manila for a bit, then showed and explained Pike, and then we had a discussion. Many of the people were EditThisPage webmasters, you're free to write up the session, if you do so, send me a pointer and I'll point. <p>

<a href="http://wws.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$98">Bill St Clair</a> has a writeup of last night's session.<p>

Two notable people were there who I had not met before. <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/hewitt/hewitt.html">Carl Hewitt</a>, a professor at MIT, is investigating SOAP, and Seth Dillingham, distinguished Frontier developer, who is very very tall. There was also a <a href="http://www.outliners.com/more30.html">MORE</a> user, didn't catch his name, who was grinning from ear to ear during the Pike demo. This was very gratifying. MORE users will like Pike, I think. It runs on Mac and Windows. It's also quite scriptable, but its technical depth is not in your face.<p>

<a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/02/08">Dan Gillmor</a>: "[Yesterday] morning at Demo, Dan Bricklin's company, Trellix, announced a product called Trellix Web Express, also aimed at writing on the Web. The products are quite different in key areas. But both validate the growing need for such tools." <i>How are they different??</i>
