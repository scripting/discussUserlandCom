<blockquote>
Wow, I just did a Napster search for a song I have been looking for in record stores, online and real-world, for years. I was willing to pay $20 for the song, but the music industry couldn't get it to me. 
<p>
The song is Them Changes by Buddy Miles.

Amazon carries <em>The Best Of Buddy Miles</em>, which includes "Them Changes".  It also carries <em>Band of Gypsies</em> (Jimi Hendrix, Billy Cox, and Buddy Miles), which includes "Changes"; I believe this is the substantially the same song.
