For instance, I am much more confident of my ability to write a TCP/IP client in a scripting language on the NT and UNIX platforms than I am on the Macintosh.  This is not because I am unfamiliar with the Macintosh, but because I found a lot of annoying Perl module incompatibilities on NT and Macintosh.  ActiveState, the company that has lead Perl 5.005 development on Windows, has aleviated a lot of these problem on NT, but I am not sure who is carrying the ball on the Mac.<p>

The problem I see with Perl, and scripting languages like it, is that they do not seem appropriate for the kind of scripting that I used to do with things like AppleScript and Frontier.  By this, I mean application automation that was one of my main claims to fame prior to the development of the Web as we know it today.<p>

Since the advent of the Web, I have simply been captivated by all of the things I could do without using desktop applications.  Nearly everything I build today is delivered through a Web Server.  So, at least half the places where I would have wanted scripting hooks in the past don't really matter to me anymore.<p>

(I should also point out that I am impressed that Frontier has jumped two huge chasms -- from simply being an alternative to AppleScript to being competitive in the Web space, and from being a Mac-only to a Mac and Win32 toolset.)<p>

A number of people speaking about the NT environment have hinted that the mechanism for scheduling tasks needs to be improved.  I tend to agree with that, although I also suspect that many of the things that we would want to do (in terms of adding/deleting scheduled tasks, and inspecting scheduled task lists) are doable today, just not in ways that are obvious to those of us who cut our teeth on non-PC platforms.
