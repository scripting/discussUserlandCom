I'm more befuddled than anything about this development. The paranoid side of me wants to say that they're trying to insure that future browser enhancements (especially those relating to XML/SOAP/etc) will be WINDOWS-ONLY, and they're trying to relegate Macs to an inferior web experience.<p>

Anyone out there in scripting-land have a different, perhaps more hopeful perspective on all this?
