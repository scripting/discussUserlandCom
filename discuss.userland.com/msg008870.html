Sexist attitudes aside, Dvorak is simply pointing out that marketing the Ibook to, er, lesseee, women, aint gonna work because there aren't enough customers to make this a viable business. He's pointing out that no, er, power user macho, umm, male would dare to be caught alive with a lemmon chiffon or aqua colored Ibook. Style does matter and eminently controls market accessibility and, er, penetration. Look beyond all the sexist fluffery that Dvorak's piece is dressed up in and that's what I think he's saying. The sexist stuff did just the job Dvorak intended, that is, start a debate.
