<i>"Wiki is a composition system; it's a news server; it's a repository; it's a mail system. Really, we don't know quite what it is, but it's a fun way of communicating asynchronously across the network."</i><p>

I thought people here might be quite interested in this even though it appears to be hacked together out of raw Unix tools doing cgi stuff. The heart of it is <i>EditThisPage</i> behavior.<p>

It's ambitious and appears to be doing what it set out to do. I already edited some of their pages with information I saw that needed changing with regard to Interactive Fiction and computer games.
