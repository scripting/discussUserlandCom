How dare they disconnect their clients' conversations just because the outside user is using the enemy's software?
   Can you imagine Sprint PCS disconnecting a phone conversation coming into their network through   a Cellular One subscriber? </i><br><p>

If Celluar One failed to pay for Sprint it customers usage of the network, then you bet that Sprint would refuse Celluar One customers.<p>

This IM spat EQUAL to Celluar Phone Cloning. MS discovered a way to make the IM phone call for free. Now when MS IM customers get cut off after they are discovered, they complain. Other companies are agreeing to provide authoized access.</br>
