The legal standard for perjury is higher than that for lying -- among other things, it must be legally relevant.  Since the Jones case was dismissed, and subsequently settled, there is a legal case for saying that the lying was not legally relevant.<p>

However, it doesn't matter very much if Clinton legally committed perjury or not, because the standard for impeachment is not a legal standard, but a political one.  Basically, it is "high crimes and misdemeanors" _as defined by the House and Senate_.  It is not sufficient to say that Clinton broke the law and therefore should be impeached -- breaking the law does not automatically qualify a president for impeachment.  <p>

It is misleading for representatives to suggest that they had to vote for impeachment because they think Clinton broke the law.  They are required to make a political judgement, not a legal one.<p>

p.s. replying to this message, because I don't know how to start a thread (maybe I can't?)
