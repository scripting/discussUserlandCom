No way! Jewish food. I like <a href="http://www.epinions.com/rest-New_York-Ratner%27s">Ratner's</a> or Sammy's or the <a href="http://www.stagedeli.com/menuny.html">Stage Deli</a>. <p>

<blockquote><i>I couldn't find a pointer to Sammy's Rumanian Steakhouse. So let me review it right here. It's a little hole in the wall in lower Manhattan, near Delancey. The steaks are huge. The waiters are cute Jewish college kids. There are pancake syrup bottles filled with schmaltz, aka chicken fat. It's a happy place. You leave feeling sick, but it's a wonderful sick feeling. It's around the corner from another big deli on Houston St whose <a href="http://www.shaw-review.com/deli.htm#Katz's Deli">name</a> escapes me. Their slogan, dating back to WWII is "Send a salami to your boy in the Army." Which teaches you how the New Yawk accent woiks.</i></blockquote><p>

In a pinch I could do Italian. New York has so much good food. I get great Thai food here in California. But a blintz from Ratner's or a flank steak at Sammy's or a mile high pastrami sandwich at the Stage is to die for. Kasha varnishka. <a href="http://www.shaw-review.com/hotdogs.htm">Kosher hot dogs</a>. Or we could do <a href="http://foody.org/eggs/reviews/juniors.html">Junior's</a> in Brooklyn (Flatbush Ave) for the best <a href="http://www.newyorkfirst.com/gifts/w027.html">cheesecake</a> in the world. <p>

Or any neighborhood Italian restaurant beats the best Italian here in Calif. Or split a pizza pie at any Ray's.<p>

<img src="http://www.newyorkfirst.com/img/products/chcake_plain.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">I once took my VP-Marketing a blonde very shicksa-ish woman to Ratner's and the waiter yelled at me for bringing such a woman to such a neighborhood (Delancey St was pretty rough then, but I hear they've cleaned it up).<p>

The waiters in Calif don't yell at you! (I miss this.)<p>

Wait, maybe we <a href="http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/html/public/press99/pr52-909.html">don't want</a> to eat at Ratner's.
