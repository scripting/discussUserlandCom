During the last few years, when good games are still available (indeed, later games for a still-popular older system tend to be better, if less visually impressive, than the first games for a new system), the consoles are usually money-makers.<p>

Frex, Sony makes a lot of money off PlayStations sold for $99 these days, but was losing money on PlayStations sold for $199 at launch.  I'm not sure when they started making money a profit on PSX's, though.
