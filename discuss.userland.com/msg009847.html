<i>This is not addressing my point. In fact it reflects an irony and something for O'Reilly to ponder. I trust the O'Reilly people to think this thru (not so sure about Linux Journal).</i><p>

Disclaimer: I haven't looked at recent issues of the Linux Journal.<p>

In the past, the LJ has always covered open source <i>and</i> proprietary software. They've had reviews, articles and advertisements for proprietary tools.<p>

If anything, their policy has always been to avoid Windows. Ask two questions: Would they cover a commercial C compiler for Linux? Would they cover Python for Windows?<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
