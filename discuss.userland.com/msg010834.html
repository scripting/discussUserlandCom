Think of when javascript rollovers first came into being, annoying as they were, a lot of sites added them based on how easy it was to implement.<p>

The javascript site Dave posted was good, but not specialized enough IMHO. What we need is a javascript (it could even be seperated as  *.js code to reduce clutter) program that will take each line by line of a RSS or ScriptingNews file and say "okay, print this out, print that out".<p>

Bang. Instant syndication.<p>

Then websites with channels can go, "download this *.js file, add the following <script></script> to your webpage, and get free content for your site"<p>

So close...
