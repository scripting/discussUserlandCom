If all fifty states do this, imagine the nightmare (or wet dream, depending on who you are) scenario that would ensue when companies try to keep track of exactly which local taxes need to be added to a transaction. Yikes.<p>

Write your congress-critter and let them hear about where you stand on this issue.
