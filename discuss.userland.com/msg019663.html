When a tool set is dragged into the floating window, a new tab is added. Tabs can be removed as well. They do cite lots of the prior art in their application, but allowing the collection of tool sets to be modified seems to be Adobe's claimed contribution.<p>

I'm not suggesting I agree with their patent, I'm just pointing out that they don't appear to be claiming they invented the <i>tabbed </i>tool palette, but rather the <i>modifiable </i>tabbed tool palette.
