Do you really think so? Every day, it seems to me, we get a little bit closer to the web being nothing more than a ip-distributed version of Windows. I can't tell you how many sites I visit that expect me to be using Windows for full functionality. Even my credit card company.<p>

From the microsoft link: <i>The power to build HTML Applications (HTA) brings Microsoft&#174; Internet Explorer 5 to the fore as a viable Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174; development platform.</i><p>

Ah, well, I never really believed that business about the web being a platform "without a platform vendor" anyway.<p>
