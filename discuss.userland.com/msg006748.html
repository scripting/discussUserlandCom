But it was still an interesting process. Here are my notes while I was considering it.<ul><p>

<li>It came to me out of the blue. I was thinking of folders, and remembered that they are often called Manilla. I liked the sound.<p>

<li>It's a lot like Mozilla. Another famous codename.<p>

<li>And it's the name of a real place, like Java.<p>

<li>And it rhymes with something known for simplicity. <i>Vanilla.</i><p>

<li>Choosing soundalike names is not unknown to me. I chose Frontier because it has the same shape as Finder, and being a Mac product, I wanted its name to look familiar to Mac users.
</ul><p>

That's it. The other choices didn't stand a chance.</li></li></li></li></li>
