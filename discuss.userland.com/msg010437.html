(I hope I am making sense here...)<p>

I am disturbed by all these issues -- not because different people favor different rules, but the differentiation between the various kinds of activities and applying different rules to them.<p>

I fail to see how the activites (e.g. scraping vs deep linking, indexing by search engine and indexing by moreover.com, process done by machine vs process done by human, etc) can be differentiated.<p>
