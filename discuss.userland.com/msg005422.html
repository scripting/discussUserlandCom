It still looks like you're saying that a Win16 developer either had to rewrite his application from scratch, or use Win32s?<p>

Since that doesn't really make sense, you probably mean something else.</i><p>

Sorry for being unclear.<p>

All I'm trying to get at is for any major Windows developer to have a healthy FUTURE (past, say the end of 1996) they would have had to dump their strategy of selling a Win32s version of their product as the version for Win32 platforms, and do a real Win32 version.  (unless your installed base was still on Win3.1, as many large IT shops were at the end of '96)<p>

And doing a real Win32 version involves updating your app to use all of the new GUI controls in Win95 -- the Win95 common controls, etc.  It involves a lot more than that too, yes I'm oversimplifying.  (Add multithreading, updated printer support, etc etc etc)<p>

There was a signification amount of rewriting going on to make that happen.<p>

I wasn't saying that Win16 apps didn't run on Win95, nor that Win32s apps didn't run on Win3.1.<p>

All things said, it was an admirable migration path, but it was from one API to a different API.  (Similar function names, but not the same, and they used different (but similar) structures for many things)  From everything I've read, the path to Carbon is less bumpy.<p>
