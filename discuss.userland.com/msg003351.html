Do you trust Steve Case to ship it? To be clear, Microsoft isn't asking us to trust them in this way. Imagine your frustration if you turn Mozilla into the ultimate XML-RPC client, and they won't ship the code? If I were you I wouldn't recommend getting into the browser distribution business in competition with AOL and Microsoft. That sounds like a formula for misery. They have really big pipes and big names. The trust factor is huge. A new name in this business would have to get pretty famous very quickly to get a sizeable installed base.
