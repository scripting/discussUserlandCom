But that aside, read what they say.  You do not need a license if all the gif's you obtained were made in compliance with their license.  So therefore as long as you use a product that has legal license to do gif's you are fine.  They are "willing" to have you spend $7500 and say even if the gif you got was not created under license we forgive you. <p>

In my opinion this will be a hard one to enforce, how are they going to know if a gif itself was created under legal license or not?
