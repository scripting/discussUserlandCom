mozilla may not have all the speed of msie, but XUL is cool.  gecko in itself is a tremendous achievement - as much as the linux kernel is.  yet X [in my mind] on top of the linux kernel is analogous to any XUL implementation on top of gecko:  flexibility vs native speed. it's the old "assembly code vs c++" or whatever.<p>

nobody wins in the mozilla vs msie battle if the end result is <i>either</i> flexibility or speed being sacrificed.  same with linux vs windows.  some of us want flexibility... some want sheer speed... and some want the golden ring of both.<p>

i keep trying to remind myself that mozilla isn't a *finished product*, by any means, and perhaps never will be.  from my experience as a software user, every update and revision that software programmers make in hopes of improving and fine-tuning their creation is more or less just a quantized rendering of a continuous change.<p>

and it's not just any individual software project that is changing, but programming and programmers as a whole.  that's what makes me excited about XUL and mozilla -- even though as a web designer i love mozilla's compliance to w3c standards.  but it's a new way of thinking about the way software and the internet should/could work.<p>

the creative process is not always welcome where it destroys tradition -- but i say good, great!  bring it on!
