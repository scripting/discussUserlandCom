I must admit I"ve lost track of Frontier since it
went commercial, but clearly Userland is exploring
some awfully cool technology and it would be bad
to lose touch :)<p>

Now if Microsoft would come out with something
like OSA and scripting (Does the Windows Scripting
Host fill this bill? It doesn't look it from a
brief glance through the doco) I'd be psyched :)<p>
