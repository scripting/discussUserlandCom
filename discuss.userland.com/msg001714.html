for several years because it is one of the better link
sites, and because he found your editorial pieces
interesting and informative.<p>

Joseph McConnell is someone who has enough respect for your
opinion to have emailed you in the past to both agree and to
disagree with things you wrote. One does not bother to reply
to those published opinions one does not value.<p>

Joseph McConnell is someone who is a old hand at
participating in discussions in moderated forums. He learned
the most important rule of posting while on CompuServe.
Attack the posting not the poster. Refute the argument
point, dont dismiss it. And if you are moderating a forum
and one is participating in a thread make an extra effort to
distinguish between legitimate dissent and ad-hominum
attacks.<p>

Joseph McConnell is someone who does not presume to know
what you want. He is someone who infers likely outcome from
actual actions not stated words. One sees someone who seems
to make a genuine attempt to build informed discussion but
one also sees a propensity to delete posts from those who
differ in opinion from the sites host.<p>

That is the hosts prerogative but the host should remember
that one learns a lot more from debating with those who
disagree with ones position than with those who agree. A
forum were dissent is suppressed always turns into
self-conglatulatory club. <p>

Joseph McConnell is someone who appreciates all the hard
work that goes into trying to set up a discussion forum. He
would also like to respectfully point out that the chances
for build a successful community would be greatly increased
if you could differentiate better between ones role as host
and moderator, and as a participant. If you can successful
compartmentalize these two roles then you may have a forum
were informed discussion and dissent can coexist and
flourish.<p>
