The first one, surveys, is <a href="http://plugins.userland.com/plugins/surveys/about">ready to run</a> on most UserLand-hosted Manila sites. <p>

If you're a Frontier <a href="http://plugins.userland.com/managers/">server manager</a>, you can install Manila plug-ins to bring new features to the sites you host. <p>

The Manila plug-ins architecture gives <a href="http://plugins.userland.com/developers/">developers</a> lots of power.<p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$374">A rambling piece</a> on competing, Blogger, Sidekick, Bill Gates, BlogThis, brilliance, Amazon, patents, why software markets die, and why Internet users are not powerless because Amazon still has competitors they can buy from.<p>

<a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$125">This</a> might set the record for the longest license plate.<p>

<a href="http://theburmanetnews.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$114">BurmaNet News</a> is <a href="http://theburmanetnews.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$109">heavy</a>. I'm starting to look at sites based on how many members they have. This one has 42. The highest membership site on EditThisPage.Com is <a href="http://friday.editthispage.com/">Crusoe's Companion</a> with 116.<p>

A Weblogs.Com <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/stats/findinweblogs?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fexec%2Fobidos%2F">search</a> reveals that 74 of the sites link to specific pages on Amazon. When you go to the sites the links can be hard to find. Amazon is quite deeply rooted on the Web, without help from a patent.<p>

<a href="http://www.weblogs.com/stats/findinweblogs?q=noamazon.com">Fourteen weblogs</a> point to noamazon.com. That's up from zero yesterday.<p>

<a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogs.pyra?txtSearch=noamazon.com">Blogger sites</a> that point to NoAmazon.Com.<p>

<a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/02/26">Dan Gillmor</a> has an email from the president of Cuesta Technologies, who says "We have been providing affiliate programs for our client web sites since 1995." <p>

Sr. Bezos makes a guest appearance on the <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/asknot.gif">asknot</a> page.<p>

Hey how did I miss that there's an <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blog_linkwatcher.pyra">XML file</a> pointing to all the Blogger sites?<p>

<a href="http://whois.userland.com/$noamazon.com">Who Is</a> NoAmazon.Com? <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Casey+Muratori&num=10&sa=Google+Search">Who Is</a> Casey Muratori</a>?<p>

"noamazonalignright"<a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/news/technology/html98/legl_19991107.html">Seattle Times</a>, 11/7/99: "Casey Muratori, a software programmer with Kirkland-based Rad Game Tools, was so incensed by the lawsuit against barnesandnoble.com that he set up a Web site called Noamazon.com. 'We were just outraged that we had spent a lot of money at their Web site and they took a stand in the wrong direction," he said of the reaction among fellow programmers at the Kirkland company. 'I'm sure the engineers at Amazon.com knew this was something that should not have been patented.'"<p>

I added two global shortcuts making it easy for UserLand-hosted Manila sites to point to NoAmazon.Com. They are "noamazon" and "noamazonalignright".<p>

Too bad this <a href="http://www.amazonsucks.com/">domain</a> is under construction.<p>

BTW, a heads-up to people with sites on UserLand servers. You don't have to agree with me. I had a conversation with a friend who has a site here and has a different position on Amazon. He said he saw me as his landlord. That's not cool. You are free to have any point of view you want, I don't want any editorial control over your sites, I only want to influence your opinion, not to dictate it.<p>
