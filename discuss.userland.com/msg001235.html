First let me address this idea that there cannot be a huge disconnect between what the people want and what a politician can do.  That's BS, plain and simple.<p>

I shall remind you that there was a time in this country when "The People" thought it was just cool to sail to another country, grab a bunch of people, bring them back in horrible conditions, sell them, and make them work.  And then a few people started to think that this was perhaps not an okay thing to do. Though they were in the minority, they were right.  Following on your logic, it should be "The People" who should be listened to.  Newsflash: The People are not right a great percentage of the time.  The fact that women couldn't vote, that blacks were treated separately in the south...all were popular at one time.  That still didn't make it right. <p>

The point there is that your argument that there is a "disconnect" between "The People" and the Government is faulty.<p>

You may not be bothered that he lied.  I am.  He is a lawyer.  He taught law.  He is the highest legal officer in the land.  It is definitely NOT OKAY for him to lie under oath.  I don't get to get away with that, there are plenty of people in jail for doing exactly what he has done in exactly the same circumstances, so why is The President special?  Shouldn't he be held to an even *higher* standard?<p>

I certainly think so.<p>
