Publishers perform an increasingly useless service, copying information that individuals who own computers connected by the Internet can copy on their own."<br><br>	I spoke briefly on the phone this afternoon with Clay Shirky, columnist for Feed, professor and startup-advisor. He wrote an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/00/07/15/oped/15shir.html">op-ed piece</a> in the NY Times about Napster that remains one of my anthems. We see eye-to-eye on where this is going, and the importance of the Internet's version of radio. He also pointed out that Napster has more members than AOL. An interesting statistic for sure. (The power of music, again.)<br><br>	The second edition of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-2e-20000814">XML 1.0 spec</a> is up for review on the W3C site.

It's been great to watch him process our stuff, I've always wondered how our work compares to Notes, and Russ is giving us some insight.<br><br>	One of the first things Russ wanted was a whitepaper, but I haven't gotten around to writing one, so Russ took on the job. We want feedback and help. Is this useful? Do you want to contribute to the process?<br><br>	We both feel that given that UserLand is a community as well as a company that the story would best be told by the community. Maybe this is not right, or <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19704">perhaps</a> now's not the time?<br><br><b>Jakob does a weblog?<a name="jakobDoesAWeblog">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/14#jakobDoesAWeblog" title="Permanent link to 'Jakob does a weblog?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Jakob Nielsen says he's not <a href="http://www.useit.com/hotlist/spotlight.html">running a weblog</a>. Hmmm. Looks like a weblog to me. Now Jakob what if I wanted to point to your comments for August 8 (I do), there's no "permalink" to that bit of your weblog (the one that's not a weblog). <br><br>	I gotta drink more coffee when I write Scripting News. Yesterday I <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/13#beingKindToTheJungle">said</a> that Netscape was the first browser. Bad Dave! Mosaic was not even the first browser. Luckily, <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19694">according</a> to Jakob, I didn't blow it too bad, because Mosaic called them Bookmarks too, not Favorites.<br><br>	Survey: <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/jakobNielsensWeblog">Should Jakob Nielsen have a weblog?</a><br><br>	I realized later that a better <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/isItAWeblog">question</a> would have been Does Jakob Nielsen already have a weblog?<br><br><b>Bees and more<a name="beesAndMore">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/14#beesAndMore" title="Permanent link to 'Bees and more' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Microsoft has a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/ecommerce/contmgt.asp">whitepaper</a> on content management.
