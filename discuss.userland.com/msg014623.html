I just deleted a whole thread of Mac users whining because they didn't like the cool trick that Jeremy Bowers did on his Manila site.<p>

Well, go tell Apple or Microsoft or Netscape, who can do something about it. Especially Apple who's screwing around with the UI now. Maybe they'd get off their butts and make sure they stay competitive.<p>

<b>Clarification</b><p>

No private whiny email.<p>

No whiny messages that begin with "This is not a whiny message." <p>
