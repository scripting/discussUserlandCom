Every member of my site has the option to set their own prefs., which include a script to generate CSS for each member. Hey - crude, but it works!<p>

I'd like to extend this further by offering a file upload form in prefs/prefssite/default. I've worked out how to draw a file upload field and make the form a multipart one (by adding to prefs.prefssite.default), but I can't see where I can point the form to postCatcher - so I can, well, catch that post!<p>

Any voices to lead me the way?<p>
