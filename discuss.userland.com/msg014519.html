Viewing a spec, manual, or other document as a single HTML file does have advantages, but can be a real nuisance if you've got a slow connection.  I like the approach GNU takes with their manuals, such as emacs (at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/emacs-20.3/emacs.html">http://www.gnu.org/manual/emacs-20.3/emacs.html</a>).  You can get the manual as a single HTML document, individual chapters in HTML, each node as a separate page, or straight ASCII, PostScript, etc.<p>

At work, I usually get the whole thing at once, but at home, the one node per page is far more usuable.<p>

By the way, anyone know of a good, cheap way to get a fast connection, that doesn't involve cable, or being close to a POTS switch?<p>
