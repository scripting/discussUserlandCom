This may be naive, but what's to stop someone from compiling in one device driver to the system that in turn can call all the code bits in a specific folder, allowing boot-time customization?<p>

Personally, as someone who has lived with shitty extensions to an OS (The Mac Component Manager) I kind of like the idea of compiling in my code at the OS level, esp for servers. <p>

Regardless, a fragmented Unix world has always been what holds Unix back. When I asked Apple to go to Linux, I was really asking you all a question. I am very happy with the level of discourse here. I feel like we're all from different backgrounds, and we're learning about each other. This is the way it should work.
