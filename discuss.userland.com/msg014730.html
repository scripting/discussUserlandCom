John Dvorak used to do this in his paper columns, must've been a decade ago. I found it distracting then, too.<p>

I've only read it two ways: that the author doesn't think most of his prose is worth reading, or that the author thinks his audience doesn't have the attention span to learn anything but the buzzwords. Either way, it screams that I should be looking to another source.<p>

So good on yer for not doing it. Keep the mischevious italic voice, though.
