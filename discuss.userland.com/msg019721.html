He's turned his history.xml file into a weblog. It's time for a callback so users' scripts can catch the history flow and turn it into any kind of XMLization they want. <br><br>BTW, this is what I meant the other day about having a tool to go with every XML format. The outlineDocument format puts the power in users hands because there's a tool with an easy hood-lift, you don't need a degree in rocket science to figure it out, it just sneaks up on you. "If he can do it, so can I."<br><br>OK, now here's a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/jeremysHistoryAsWeblog.gif">screen shot</a> of Jeremy's <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/irights@jerf.org/history.xml">history.xml</a> file, integrated with the user hierarchy on OurFavoriteSongs.Com. The XML is a constantly changing, so don't expect to see exactly what's in the screen shot.<br><br>It's an exciting time! Our users are trying things before we thought of them. <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/radio-userland/830">Yesterday</a> Aaron Swarz tried to open <a href="http://www.scripting.com/xml/currentOutline.xml">Scripting News</a> in Radio UserLand.

";->" (The next <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$890">Woz</a>, again imho.)<br><br>I got an email from Aaron correcting me. He's 13, not 14! I told him that I first met Wes when he was roughly that age. I didn't meet Woz until he was in his 30s. (He just turned 50 last week.)<br><br>WSJ: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/446281.asp?0nm=-25B">Writers sue Web publishers</a>.
