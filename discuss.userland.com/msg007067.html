I'm not so sure; I think BizTalk represents a deviation from the XML-RPC work I have read about (and admired) here. It looks like the proposed <Route> tag in the BizTalk framework is intended to specify not just where a document is destined, but what application is to be invoked on the receiving end. This is done via the "process" attribute of the <from> and <to> tags. I am gleaning this from the <a href="http://www.biztalk.org">BizTalk Framework XML Tags Specification</a>.<p>

This is a twist on XML-RPC, I think. If I understand correctly, I build an XML-RPC call and specify the data to be passed as part of the marked-up call. I suspect that data could be an XML document itself (something more complex than <i4&gt; for example). In BizTalk, the business document itself is moved around and embedded in it are the routing and processing instructions. It's sort of an inversion of XML-RPC.<p>

This appears to leave the decision of how to specify the procedure to be invoked up to the developer - unless BizTalk 1.0 attempts to formalize that syntax. At the moment, I don't see how XML-RPC can fit into this strategy.
