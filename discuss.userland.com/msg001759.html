here are some comments on the latest Tonto release:<p>

- Storing the cached scripts in a menu bar is much better. But it confused me that I am supposed to keep a seperate menubar for each app. That just messes up the user.tonto table. Why not keep just one menubar, with a 'submenu' for each app?<p>

Check out <a href="http://129.13.100.103/misc/tontocache.gif">http://129.13.100.103/misc/tontocache.gif</a> for how it could look.<p>

Hint: there is another idea, look at the line containing 'MSIE, MOSS'. You could have shared scripts that way. A creator name should be able to show up several times.<p>

- it would be great if the window position could be remembered after a restart<p>

- same with the mode (add user.tonto.mode and then do tonto.setMode (user.tonto.mode) in startup script)<p>

- I seem to be getting errors when I have a global button which calls tonto.registerCachedScripts (). When I press it, Frontier keeps a process running and Tonto crashes (at least does weird things).
I know that this is not a nice thing to do. But then someone else will do it as well. And I thought that Tonto was just the perfect tool for such an often repeated task. :-)<p>
