At the moment all it does is connect to the masterlist of files at my.userland.com and allow the choose which channel they would like to display.<p>

I've posted it to <a href="http://xml.cameronmartin.com/rss/">http://xml.cameronmartin.com/rss/</a><p>

Once I have an XML-RPC spec to work to this potentially will grow to be much more sophisticated -- I mainly wanted to build this Proof of Concept to validate that this type of system could be built in IE5.<p>

Dave, do you have any plans to post your work-in-progress XML-RPC specs for the RSS file syndication? I'm not using Frontier and I'm not looking foward to having to pull apart what you're doing at <a href="http://pointers.userland.com/myUserLandRoot/suite/">http://pointers.userland.com/myUserLandRoot/suite/</a><p>

Any chance of some doco? Work-in-progress is fine.<p>
