Wouldn't a simple alteration to the msgReader template make this happen, such that the "Discuss" link was to the specific day the message was originally posted, e.g. <p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/$1999/01/20">http://discuss.userland.com/$1999/01/20</a><p>

instead of:<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/">http://discuss.userland.com/</a>
