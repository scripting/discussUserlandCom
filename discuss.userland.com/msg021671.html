Their question is:<p>

<b>Was Clinton correct to release some of the nation's strategic oil reserves?</b><p>

Fine with me. Let's look at your choices of answer:<p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, the situation has become critical.
<li>No, doing so will not contribute to a long-term solution.
</ul><p>

Now, there's a big problem to me. I want to vote yes. I don't care whether he's doing so to help Gore or not. If there's a small chance that the oil price increase will affect some poor people's life during the winter (even if the government is exaggerating the problem), I feel that we should take the risk and release some oil reserve. No one knows whether it will help or not, but if we don't try, nothing will be changed.<p>

Anyway, back to the survey. I can simply click on <b>Yes</b>, but I am not 100% against their answer of <b>No</b>. <b>Releasing the oil reserve is definitely not a long-term solution. </b> Put it this way, If my choices are just Yes and No. I will say <b>Yes</b>. But, if saying yes means the opposite of <b>No</b>, then I am not so sure I am in the position of saying <b>Yes</b> to this question. Because, the opposite of this <b>No</b> would mean, <i>"Doing so (releasing some oil reserve) will contribute to a long-term solution."</i><p>

I assume that MSNBC must be paying quite a bit of money for their editors, but how could they allow this survey to go live? It doesn't make any sense at all!
