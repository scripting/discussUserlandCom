<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> with soft updates configured (apparently this gives it a 7-8 times boost over Linux;
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> as your MTA;
and <a href="http://www.list.org/">Mailman</a> as your list manager. Mailman has built-in archiving support.<p>

Ebay uses Postfix, and they send out a phenomenal quantity of e-mail. Python.org have switched to Postfix and they use Mailman. Mailman is written in Python fwiw.<p>

<a href="http://www.pair.com/">Pair.com</a>, a web hosting provider, also provide mailing list support through <a href="http://www.pairlist.net/features.shtml">Pairlist.net</a>, and their software list is as I've noted above.<p>

For best filesystem performance you need one of the BSDs, and from what I've read, Freebsd seems to be the one people use for high-performance mail and web servers.
