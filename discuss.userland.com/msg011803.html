The upside is that someone who's familiar with the mailserver (of which there admittedly aren't that many) could probably add the xml-rpc calls in a couple of hours, so long as it was a reasonably simple interface.<p>

Even if you then subsequently replace all of the parts with higher performance versions, you still have been working against a reference implementation. <p>

Never underestimate the power of a working server to test against.<p>
