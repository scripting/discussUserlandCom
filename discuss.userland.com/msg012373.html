Now, to the substance, XML-RPC is not going to get store and forward capabilities, at least as far as I know. That's been the major disconnect in this "discussion" so far, and due to people not asking questions before they jump to conclusions.<p>

The trouble I was having had to do with an *implementation* of XML-RPC in the Frontier environment. It related to strategies for asynchronous messaging, having absolutely nothing to do with the protocol. If Flutterby's comments had been on a mail list they could have reasonably been interpreted as being <i>off topic.</i><p>

That said, I would be interested in exploring the transmission of XML-RPC over SMTP, sometime next millennium, after we ship Frontier 7.0.<p>

And thanks again for the collegial approach. Much appreciated. No sarcasm.
