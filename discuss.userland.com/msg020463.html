I'd say there is - the
                                  value of time. The time that would have been spent (wasted) researching in the dark.<p>

                                  If your time's worth $100/hour and reading someone else's code saves you 10 hours of research, the
                                  value to you is $1000. The value to me may be even more - I may have saved 40 hours of research
                                  (maybe I'm a slower researcher than you).</i>
<P>
Fortunately, the public library is enlightened enough not to demand that you give it the fruits of your labor -- all of them -- because it saved you a bit of time. Some people seem to believe that programmers who use open source should do that, even if it means they go broke.
