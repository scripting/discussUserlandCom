At this time there is no projected shipdate for 6.0. There's a lot more work to do. 6.0 is, at this time, just a convenient name for all the new server-workstation stuff. There's also a lot more kernel work to do. The outliner is getting an overhaul in this release, among other things. <p>

It'll be a point release, probably the biggest add in functionality of any Frontier release. But, a very important thing to note about 6.0 which I can't repeat too often, it leverages everything you know about building websites in 5.x. You'll get a lot of features added on to the current content management system. Also better docs!<p>

Brent can tell you the plan for the COM client. It's one of the next things on his list, so it's a very current topic, and that will be for 5.x users, not just for 6.0.<p>

Also coming very soon, 5.1.5, with many many fixes.<p>

Dave
