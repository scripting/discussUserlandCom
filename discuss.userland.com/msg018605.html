I got the impression that he was making reference to two different people: Dave in the first section, and then a different person beginning with "The conspiracy buffs." The transition is pretty ambiguous, and I could see folks getting confused and attributing the source of the misogynistic notes to the same person Cooper is talking about in the first part of the column (Dave).<p>

If Cooper is in fact writing about two different web authors/journalists in his column, it seems he could have been a bit more clear about the separate identities.<p>
