Dan found the old <a href="http://my.netscape.com/publish/formats/rss-spec-0.91.html">Netscape RSS 0.91 spec</a>, with his comments from 1999, explaining their philosophy for RSS. It's an exact match with UserLand's, <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss">then and now</a>. This should put to rest the debate over what RSS is. He also credits UserLand, appropriately, for our contribution to RSS 0.91. <i>What a great birthday present. </i><br><br>Ohhhh mama, I had a birthday hard disk crash. Yup I lost a lot of work. Not going to worry about it right now. <br><br>Postscript: As I put back together all my favorites and settings for the 18th time in the last three years, maybe now the value of HailStorm or something like it is sinking in.

I don't think he would have appreciated it, but I do. I kindof believe in reincarnation, so there's something really silly about Maggie and my grandpa having the same birthday. Next time I see Maggie I'm going to ask her about the plutocracy and see if her ears perk up. ";->"<br><br>	I have a song picked out, it came from my Father's Day exploration last year, when Napster was opening new doors for growth for me. It all comes back in an instant. I wrote an essay on Father's Day last year, but I'm not ready to publish it. My birthday and Father's Day are linked in the past. I know some people would understand my Father and Son story, and by sharing it, it could help some other people, probably mostly men, to figure out how to make peace with their parents, or their childhood. In the meantime, if you can find a copy of <a href="http://dave.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$147">Father and Son</a>, set it on repeat. Let it sink in. We're different, but we're the same. Life is confusing, but it <i>can</i> be very simple. Neither of them got that, they struggle to accept each other.
