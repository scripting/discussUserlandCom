While superior to Frontier in some aspects (security, micro-mangement of users, integration with Oracle stored data, 7-24-stability, scalability), my experience makes me doubt that relational databases are a good foundation for content management. <p>

<ol>
<li>Building/adapting anything outside what comes in the box, often gets realy time consuming and expensive.
<li>They often store pages as blobs, and have litle or no knowledge off the content. 
<li>The matrix-table structure that data is stored in, is quite unlike the tree structure that we often see on the web. It can be mapped in, but this adds an layer of complexity.

P.S. I would count Notes as one of the competitors. It's a nightmare, but a nightmare that delivers. And I would not be surprised if someone soon builds a killer system on the excellent Zope foundation.</li></li></li>
