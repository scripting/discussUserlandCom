In a crowd of over 750 upper high school and lower college students only two people held their hands up. Those around them could see that they are obviously joking. With that he said that File sharing would never go away and when one method dies, 10 more will sprout up."<br><br>	My response: "Don't trust anyone over 30, and tell them that a 45-year old told you that, so you know it's true. ;->"<br><br><b>Weblogs are not a passing fad<a name="weblogsAreNotAPassingFad">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/04#weblogsAreNotAPassingFad" title="Permanent link to 'Weblogs are not a passing fad' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.evhead.com/?archive=2000_08_01_ev.xml#580263">As Evan Williams says</a>, the idea of easy writing for the Web is here to stay. Every once in a while a pundit trivializes weblogs, as Jon Udell does. "There was once a hope that the weblog could become a powerful tool for reaching out and connecting with the world. Instead, it has become a powerful tool for self-gratification and self-absorption." Hey Jon, there are good weblogs and self-gratifying ones, and some of the self-gratifying ones are good. So what. <br><br><b>Steve Ross spots a bug<a name="steveRossSpotsABug">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/04#steveRossSpotsABug" title="Permanent link to 'Steve Ross spots a bug' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://mountaintop.weblogs.com/2000/08/04">Steve Ross</a>: "Almost every article I've read has referred to the sharing of digital music online as 'piracy,' the very term that the RIAA has pounded into our heads. The only problem with this characterization is that it has not been legally proven (And even if it were, I would argue that our current intellectual property laws are relics of a prior era, and should be radically modified.) If Napster were to win in court, and music sharing were declared 'fair use,' then it absolutely cannot be considered 'piracy.'"<br><br><b>Windows, the first musical operating system<a name="windowsTheFirstMusicalOperatingSystem">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/04#windowsTheFirstMusicalOperatingSystem" title="Permanent link to 'Windows, the first musical operating system' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q261/1/86.ASP">Microsoft</a>: "During normal operation or in Safe mode, your computer may play <i>Fur Elise</i> or <i>It's a Small, Small World</i> seemingly at random.

Today I'm thinking of it (seriously) as a multi-user <i>musical</i> operating system that runs over the Internet. First there were graphical operating systems, it make sense that music comes next. Who doesn't like music? <br><br>	Yesterday's improvements <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/history.xml">can be seen</a> in my history file. When my player starts a new song it hurls an xml-rpc message at the server, which saves a new version of the file onto a static server. Now, since our ID3 act is together, you get the artist, album and song title, if they were in the MP3 file on my system.<br><br><b>A lab environment?<a name="aLabEnvironment">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/04#aLabEnvironment" title="Permanent link to 'A lab environment?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	To lawyers who say programmers must keep a "lab notebook" to defend against all kinds of suits, that's another view of Scripting News. It's a "lab notebook". Even if the lawyers didn't demand it, every programmer should keep one, imho, and it should be public, so everyone can see how our minds work, and how we "steal from the best" just like writers and musicians do. (Do I have to wear a "lab coat" too?)<br><br>	Of course I think that patent infringement suits are worthless garbage. I am an American citizen, born in the USA, where we value freedom above all, and freedom of speech is the number one freedom, afaik. I'm writing a story. The Internet and my software are deeply integrated. If the Internet is a free-speech zone (damn straight) then so is my programming space. One and the same thing.<br><br>	Programmers are always having to learn how lawyers' minds work. How about returning the favor? Here's a programming concept. The "default value" of something. This is the value of a variable if the user hasn't specified one. Now, apply this to the law. The "default value" of the variable freeSpeech should be "true".<br><br>	<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19464">Ralph Hempel</a> keeps a lab notebook too. "I love writing in my lab log, it's easy to do in between compiles, while I'm connecting to the Web, or while the soldering iron is heating up."<br><br>	<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2611544,00.html">ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley dives</a> into the minds of programmers. It's great to see this kind of stuff. All the reporting on the high tech industry, but little of it reflects how programmers work. <br><br><b>It's the community, honey<a name="itsTheCommunityHoney">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/04#itsTheCommunityHoney" title="Permanent link to 'It's the community, honey' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Radio UserLand is getting another community feature this morning. You know the XMLization of the signed-on users <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users.xml">list</a>. I'm going to load that into an outline.<br><br>	This is a miletone, it's the first time I've loaded a live XML file into the outliner over HTTP. It's working, here's a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/primitiveUsersListInAnOutli.gif">screen shot</a>.<br><br>	Now for people who think that outliners haven't changed in ten years, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/afterExpandingScriptingNews.gif">check this out</a>. When I double-click on Scripting News Radio, it makes an HTTP request, gets the XML text in my history file, parses it, and fills in the songs under it. <br><br>	To refresh, collapse and re-expand. This is a Web browser, but it's not HTML that it's browsing, it's XML. It'll be easy to generalize and allow the user to specify callbacks to process other kinds of XML. I think we're onto something.

But keep spreading those rumors. <br><br>	Gotta love the music industry. When asked "What about what Courtney said?" one ex-Warner exec says "She did crack while she was pregnant." OK, I guess then we should ignore <i>everything</i> she <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/">said</a>, right? <br><br>	I wonder if there are any <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=mensch">mensches</a> in the music biz.<br><br>
