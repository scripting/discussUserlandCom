So for instance you could create a web form that asks for a web page in a "field" and you will be able to create a styled page in that field - add tables, colors, links etc just like it was a regular web page - then the HTML is submitted in the form.<p>

Also I think that even now in Nav 5.0 you can take "any" page - select "edit mode" and now that page is immediately editable!  If someone combines this with webDAV this will be very powerful.
