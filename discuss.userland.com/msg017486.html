No, they think it's more dangerous because it's a digital transmission, and thus has the potential to be a <em>perfect copy.</em><p>

Did you also notice the length requirements, which are specified long enough to make it inconvenient to record a whole broadcast without running out of space? :^) Many of the rules attempt to prevent knowing when an item might "air," thus discouraging the ability to "record" it.<p>
