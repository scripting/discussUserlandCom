Re: why don&#180;t writers have their special tools but instead use MS.<p>

I remember a review of Microsoft Word for Macintosh (some ancient version) by Douglas Adams for Macworld Magazine UK. Maybe someone has a pointer to it on the web. If I remember his points correctly, D. A. would be thrilled by Manila and Pike as a writing tool. Maybe someone should point it out to him.<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
