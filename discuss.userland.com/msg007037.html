I agree. However, I think it would be useful to have a service that tracks links, so that people can find all the links of a certain kind to a certain page. <a href="http://crit.org/">CritLink</a> seems to do a good job of this; it even uses meta tags to distinguish different kinds of links.<p>

And if you see a comment about a page, you can use the same service to find all comments about the author's home page, thus serving as a sort of "reputation manager".
