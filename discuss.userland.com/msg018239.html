The crypto doesn't really need to be perfect. It needs to simply present a high enough barrier to entry to discourage unencrypted duplication. Certainly it will be broken and the unencrypted media distributed. But if the most common format is the encrypted one or with a token-passing online authentication method (is user foo authorized to access content bar), then access to unencrypted media players will be hard to come by, authentication bypassing techniques will be hard to come by, and you'll really have to try hard to get that thing that you want. <p>

Most people don't want to radically break the law. We'll go 10 MPH over the speed limit but not run red lights. Collectively, we have acceptable limits, and some individuals <i>will</i> go beyond them. The same will happen here. If it is clearly apparent that getting the media that you don't have rights to is an illegal act, but getting the media that you *do* have rights to is simple and straighforward and flexible, then I think people will largely fall in line.<p>

I primarily used to use BBS to get software illegally not because I didn't want to pay, but because I usually needed the product *now* and CompUSA was closed or out of stock. Sometimes I would forget to buy the product, or the need passed and I didn't bother. With online purchasing and download, I buy everything as soon as I need it - at 2AM and can use it at 2:15AM. The industry responded to my problem and my behavior has changed as a result. I can still pirate it. I know the software is there. But paying is easier than not paying so that's what happens. (Companies consistently underestimate the value of people's time relative to their money.)<p>

I think that's all that needs to happen. Make it easier to pay for <b>what you want</b> than to steal it. If you already own the CD, then they need to find a way to allow you to download the MP3 for free. If you only want one song, they need to offer that as well.
