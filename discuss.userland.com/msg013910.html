The last time it did this one of my mR discussion groups gives the following error when the "default," or "people" pages are access, but the "public" pages work ok.   <p>

     Sorry! There was an error: Can't complete the operation
     because Windows reported an error: "Reached end of file".<p>

I must have a bad database, but I can't determine which one.  I am able to open and close discuss, members, config, htmlInterfaces, and mainResponder.  Where else should I look?
