And it's freely reusable? (I think you just have to have some kind of attribution stuff).<p>

It would be sooo cooool if my.userland.com took advantage of this "open source yahoo" directory.  I maintain about 6 subcategories myself and anyone else can join and contribute to it as well.<p>

It's called the open directory project (formerly newhoo).

You can download an RDF dump of the whole hierarcy here:

If anything it could be a nice test case for Frontier 6 to chew on as a big XML file to play with.....
