I used PhotoShop on both platform a lot, and I can tell. When I first switch to PC, I thought it's just because I hadn't get used to the environment. But I quickly found that, the mouse actually responses differently. The mouse on the Mac feels more "precise". I don't know why I have this feeling, but I know it's not a hardware issue, 'cause I use Kensington's mouses on both the Mac and the PC. It might have something to do with the mouse-focusing.<p>
