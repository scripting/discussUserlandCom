<i>reformed adj. Abbr. ref.<br>
1. Improved by the removal of faults or abuses.<br>
2. Improved in conduct or character</i><p>

<i>I believe that the first two definitions apply.</i><p>

<i>Speaking of laws, it appears that Gresham's Law applies to the Internet as well.</i><p>

given that Germany ended up with a new government and a new
constitution after the war (well, two of each, actually),
anyone talking about post-war german governments as reformed
nazis are really stretching things beyond reason.  hardly
what I'd call "good money".<p>

in other words, feel free to keep on posting.</br></br>
