I actually believe MS should be left as it is. I personally can't see the problems that some believe exist. <p>

The browser issues for me are purely technical. I choose IE for what I see as its better standards support but have no problems building cross-platform apps that behave quite nicely. Netscape on Mac, the apps work. As the standards mature then the it only becomes more likely that cross-platforms apps will proliferate. <p>

The points you make about IE letting you choose Messenger and the fact that the most standards compliant browser shipping for the only real competitor desktop os (Mac) is made by Microsoft all amuse me. If Netscape or someone else is able to produce a highly standards compliant browser (it matters little whether it is on linux, personally I say make it 'insanely great' on Mac) then excellent, until they do they should shut and keep working they have little to complain about.
