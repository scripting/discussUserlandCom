The original largest size (480x216, menace480.mov) movie uses simple 4:1 compression on a 22 khz signal, giving a 182 kbps data rate.  It sounds even better, but takes 3.3 MB.<p>

The larger QuickTime 4 movie (640x288, menace640qt4.mov) movie uses QDesign Music 2 at 125 kbps on a 44 khz signal.  It sounds just as good, but is only 2.2 MB.  Twice the frequency content (should be twice the size), but only 2/3 the size.<p>

Movie soundtracks -- especially Star Wars ones! -- are much more demanding than typical music.  They've got large dynamic range, orchestral and other music, PLUS percussive explosions, laser beams etc etc.  MP3 just wouldn't handle this well at all -- evan at 128 kbps.
