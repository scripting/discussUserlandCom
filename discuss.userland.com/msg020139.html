problem, and not too hard to solve (from my programming point-of-view). <p>

But there's a cultural shift involved here as well. <p>

At the moment, it's accepted all over that 'it's okay to give away someone else's art'.  And so said giving-away is tolerated. <p>

The cultural shift I'm thinking of is a cultural shift in which
everyone realizes to some extent that creative people must be
supported in their creativity.  So as the software that supports
micropayments on new works comes on-line, it gets used and creators
get the continuing support they need. In a way that's easy for everybody - including the creator - to use, because many creative people in my circle are terrible business people.<p>

Getting across that cultural bridge is the hard part. 
It hasn't happened in hundreds of years, but it could happen
in time for me to use it.
