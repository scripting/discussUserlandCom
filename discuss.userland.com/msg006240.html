Given a copy of the Mac ROMs and a recent version of the MacOS, you should be able to get your Macintosh software running under LinuxPPC. (You may see a 5% performance loss.)<p>

It's probably got a few problems still, of course. But I bet it's a fun way to spend a rainy afternoon. The Mac ROMs seem especially ammenable to being run on a virtual Mac; somebody at Apple must have kept their code clean.<p>

Cheers,
