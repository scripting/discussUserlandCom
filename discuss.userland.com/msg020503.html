Can you elaborate on that?  ":-)"
<p>
I'm not denying RMS's talent <i>as a programmer</i>, nor his efforts to build a free-software movement <i>among programmers</i>.  Furthermore, if there hadn't been high-quality products like Linux and Apache to point to, the marketing campaign for open source would never have gotten off the ground.  However, ESR and his colleagues in the Open Source Initiative set out to convince <i>the suits</i> that open-source software was good <i>for them</i>, and I think they've been pretty successful.
<p>
I will admit to being on the margins of this whole thing, so feel free to tell me that based on your extensive experience in the industry I'm full of baloney.
