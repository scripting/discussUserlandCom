<p>I would say, then, that there are probably different kinds of respect, just as there are different kinds of love.</p>
<p>I have no idea why you say that when it's gone, it's gone forever.</p>
<p>Nor do I think Cam is being ridiculed. That doesn't mean that the comments are nice, or friendly... but I would say that they have nothing at all to do with respect or disrespect.</p>
