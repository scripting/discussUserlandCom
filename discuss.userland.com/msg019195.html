I'm not a lawyer either, but <A HREF="http://dl.napster.com/opposition.pdf">David Boies' court brief</A> (that's a PDF, by the way!) had some interesting stuff in it.  In particular, one passage strikes me as a very strong and clear argument that this injunction should never have been issued and could very well be overturned in the future.  Starting on Page 30:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>X. THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS TIPS SHARPLY AGAINST AN INJUNCTION.</B><p>

The law is clear that a preliminary injunction must be denied if the balance of hardship on the defendant is too great. <i>Abend v. MCA, Inc., 863 F.2d 1465, 1479 (9th Cir. 1979), aff’d sub
nom, Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207 (1990)</i>. Without an injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer no harm. An injunction against Napster could not significantly protect Plaintiffs’ intellectual
property, as other file sharing programs, such as Scour Exchange, CuteMX, I-Mesh and Gnutella,would expand to take Napster’s place. <i>Hall Decl. at &#182;&#182; 15-19; Barry Decl. &#182; 13</i>. Further, an injunction would do nothing to eliminate the millions of CDs available on the Internet.<p>

By contrast, the requested injunction would effectively put Napster out of business. Its irreversible effects on Napster are palpable and certain: closing its service and severing important relationships with investors, its own employees, and users who would rapidly transition to other file-sharing and directory services. <i>Barry Decl. at &#182; 13; Hall Decl. at &#182; 83.</i></BLOCKQUOTE><p>

Yeah, it's a biased source, but if the root argument is true, and I doubt it's completely false, this injunction was very wrong.<p>

Based on the tone of the judges voice I'm picking up reading <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,17168,00.html">The Standard</a>, <a href="http://irights.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$675">I think</a> the judge has already ruled.
