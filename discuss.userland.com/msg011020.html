It's a good question.<p>

My answer is that as long as it is <I>my</I> content that is driving your browser, I pretty much don't care how it got there.  I don't care if you are using Lynx, AOL, a proxy, or psychic impulses (just to be silly :-) ).  I also don't care if you were sent there by a link, a search engine, or blind chance (www.[company name].com).<p>

The difference is that Third Voice introduces new, unwelcome, unrelated content into the pages, where AOL is merely another level of processing.  The proxy part itself is not bothersome... it's what it <I>does</I>.
