When Sony introduced MiniDisc with its ATRAC compression, they got ripped in reviews because ATRAC is a lossy compression scheme that altered the music. MP3 is the same, and in many ways worse than ATRAC. I have a 4-track MiniDisc mixing console for audio recording, and although I can hear the loss due to compression, it's nothing compared to what MP3 does to the music -- sucks the life out of it.<p>

By the way, Sony's using ATRAC in its memory sticks, now.<p>
