People should be able to browse these different websites with the same accounts.<p>

What I tried was to paste the address of a "real" #membershipgroup table into the two other site's membershipgroup, but Frontier complained not to be able to find a *subtable* called '#membershipGroup'. Is there any way, trivial or nontrivial, to do this without modifying mainResponder?<p>

Best regards,
and TIA for any input
