	It doesn't help.
	
	You can write in style, change this, change that; bold this, bold that. But after you submit, the browser will bring back plain text.<p>

	I think one half of the job of a text editor is for styling (changing page format, font styles and sizes, spacing ...), another half is for easy writing and editing (grammar checking, spell checking, thesaurus ... ).<p>

IMHO, although the web browser cannot give you text styling, it should at least give you easy writing. Everytime when I use Outlook Express, when I type a misspelled word, and when Outlook Express underlines the misspelled word just like MS Word, I wonder why Internet Explorer cannot do that when I write email using my Hotmail account!
