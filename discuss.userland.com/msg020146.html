Forbes Magazine reports:
<P>
<blockquote>
 [Stallman] retaliated [against the computer scientists who left the MIT AI Lab 
   to form Symbolics] by sabotaging his former colleagues' sophisticated commercial 
   programs for powerful computers, singlehandedly hacking up his own versions and 
   giving them away. "They accused me of costing them millions of dollars," he says. 
   "I hope it's true." 
</blockquote>
<P>
Stallman's activities were intended to sabotage Symbolics' business prospects. Stallman reaffirmed this in an interview published in BYTE magazine (where he claimed that he wanted to "punish" Symbolics) and again in interviews with Steven Levy for the book "Hackers." Levy reports that Stallman's sole motive was "revenge."
<P>
There is, furthermore, absolutely no question that the creation of commercial software is a field of endeavor which he attempts to sabotage in the same way via the GPL. Stallman affirms this in <i>The GNU Manifesto</i>, cited earlier in this thread.
