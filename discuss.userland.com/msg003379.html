The good news is that this *should* eventually work with Netscape browsers across all platforms as well as IE on Windows. The bad news is, it doesn't yet. The problem is that Netscape (4.5) is confused by the URI of the applet archive, which doesn't have the .jar extension it usually has. It works now on Internet Explorer 4.0 on Windows. If you get an error message, either the applet has not completed loading or the loading has been interrupted by the server (you may have to try some reloads depending on how far you're away from the MTTF server).<p>

The applet is around 40 k big and will be included in the next version of the XML-RPC library for Java. There aren't any docs yet, but you can look at the source of the HTML page to get an idea how this will work from JavaScript. <p>

Have fun with XML-RPC!
