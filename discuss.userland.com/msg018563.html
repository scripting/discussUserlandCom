He had no plan. That's half the story, in a nutshell. <p>

Now the question was how long should the users wait? The users waited quite a long time. That's the other half of the story.<p>

I've thought about the questions some have asked about Frontier. You know what, if a Napster-like system for software developed, and it included everyone else's software too, you're damned right I would want Frontier included.<p>

In other words, if I were Ulrich, what I'd do is set up a server at Exodus and load every Metallica song onto its hard disk. I'd put a copy of Napster on the machine, log on, and let the magic happen.
