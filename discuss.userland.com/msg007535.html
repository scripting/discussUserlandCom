really?  one could believe that phrases like:<p>

"By /.../ submitting a Summary File to the My Netscape Network, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use".<p>

and<p>

"You are responsible for the RDF Site Summary File"<p>

and<p>

"You must be authorized to represent an organization or entity
if your Channel is associated with that particular organization
or entity."<p>

in the terms of use means that you cannot register someone
else's channel. unless you like to get yourself into legal
trouble, of course...
