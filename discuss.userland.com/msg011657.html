ThirdVoice creeped me out because it was centralized -- their plugin, their server, etc.<p>

CritLink gives me hopes for the web being what it was intended to be -- e.g. giving *me* as *reader* the power to *annotate*. And *share*. The difference? Foresight lets you download the code, that to participate in a Crit discussion I *opt in* that conversation.<p>

Maybe because my "milieu" is education, and we keep trying to connect contexts -- these tools (done *right*) really open possibilities. And deployment like CritLink let us taylor it to our smaller discussion.<p>

(What's next? It's a violation when someone uses JavaScript to display something other than the URL when they link to you? I mean, you can easily be messing with a brand there...)
