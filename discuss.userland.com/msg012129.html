God speaks to us thru baseball, at least *my* god does.<p>

I grew up 10 blocks from Shea Stadium so I could properly attend to my religion. I went to Shea when I was seven years old, I thought they had built the stadium just for me. I'm not kidding! It just made sense to me that it would be that way.<p>

What's amazing to me is that this team full of strange names seems to be continuous with the charmed team that I rooted for when I was a kid.<p>

So Jacob I think that's it for me, and I've heard others say it too. Baseball is about continuity. We're a very young country, and baseball works as a link to our past and something we share with our parents and esp our uncles and also our nephews.<p>

I remember how my father got crazy watching the Mets beat the Red Sox in 1986. My dad just doesn't let go very often. For me, I'll never forget how he rolled around on the floor in utter amazement when Mookie won the last game of that series.<p>

The Cubs have their stadium and beer and whatever else they do. The Yankees have stature (say this with an impressed voice). Who cares about any other teams? But the Mets, it's like that Harry Nilsson song where he says God must live in NYC. God lives in the Mets.<p>

<i>You gotta believe!</i><p>

One more note. I pity the poor Atlanta Braves, they just don't know what they're dealing with. Is there any spirituality in that team? I doubt it. They look like caricatures to me. That guy Rocker. Whatta face. Look under Mookie's cap. "It's dark under there!" (I didn't make that up.)
