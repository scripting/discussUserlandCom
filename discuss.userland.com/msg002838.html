Ok, you can stop laughing now - what I mean is say you wanted to send a message in a "bottle" to your great grandchildren, or to your unborn child.  It would be interesting if there was a way to store this message and somehow trigger it when that person became "able" to read email.  I know there are many problems with this - the least of which is how you would ever know that that new person's email is, but the delayed email concept intrigued me.
