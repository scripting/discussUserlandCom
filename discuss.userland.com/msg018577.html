I've downloaded a few just for the heck of it, and I tried Napster ... and the quality leaves me nonplussed.</i></font><p>

I suspect that most MP3s on Napster are home-encoded using the default encoder settings. Those defaults typically compromise sound quality in favor of smaller file sizes. A 3-minute song reduced to 1.5MB is encoded at about 128kbps. It's like JPG (or any other lossy compression format): a file encoded for low quality might be less than 1/4 the size of one encoded for best quality. And, despite the hype, MP3 is a lossy compression format. It tries to throw away only the parts that people don't notice, but the more you throw away, the harder it is to disguise the losses.<p>

I experimented with the bits-per-second setting on N2MP3 (a MacOS encoder), and found that it has a major impact on play quality. At 128kbps, there's significant degradation--like AM radio, or worse. 192kbps is commonly used for pop & rock recordings, but I could definitely still hear the difference there, as well; IMO, it still wasn't as good as FM radio. I settled on 384kbps; a careful listener (or an audiophile) may be able to tell the difference if listening alternately to the original CD and the encoded MP3, but you still get better than 7:1 compression. If the primary distribution format was 256kbps or 384kbsp MP3 (other production elements remaining equal), I'd prefer by far to simply pay for and download the individual songs I want to buying a CD on which I might like only a couple of the songs. (256kbps is okay for rock and most pop, but for folk or classical a higher rate is needed.) I think the real issues are (1) how much to charge/pay for a song or CD (perhaps $X per song or $8X for a 12- to 14-track CD-"bulk packaging") and (2) how can such payments be handled (business model, technology, etc.).<p>

<font color='#000066'><i>Call me nuts, but lately I've found that part of me wants the MP3 craze not to get industry support, for fear that getting a lossless copy of the music is going to become more expensive and difficult.</i></font><p>

On the other hand, MP3 recording is a godsend for me; I have bunches of old, out-of-print LPs. I never played them much; instead, I copied them to tape, then played the tapes until they wore out. Then I'd have to do it all over again. Now I can do them once, and never again have to repeat the (time-consuming) process. 'Course, that means I have to play some 30-year-old LPs again for only the 3rd or 4th time....<p>

And I *haven't* posted them on Napster et al, nor do I intend to do so. I transcribe them from LP for personal use, not for distribution.<p>
