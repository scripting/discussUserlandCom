Linux speaks SMB and TCP and AppleTalk and HTTP and strange IBM protocols which have been lost in the depths of time. It reads your Amiga disks and hooks into your Acorn EcoNet.

There's more to that to embracing other platforms.  All the while, many Linux users and developers will tell you that you should <I>really</I> just be using Linux and give up on those other systems.<p>
