Tell people what you're going to say. Say it. Then, tell people what you just said. A lot of writing on the web is too sparse -- people need more context than a lot of bloggers give.<p>

To borrow an example from your web log (which I cite primarily because your log is one of the more interesting I've read lately): "Cam is pointing to some fascinating essays by John Stevenson. A lot of these ideas I've seen replicated in by many other authors." More context on what the essays were about would have been helpful -- the Barlow quote was much more informative (though I think he and Stevenson are both wrong).<p>

BTW, regarding that Chronicle of Higher Ed. piece you commented on. If educator's think technology creates bad writers, perhaps that explains the almost unreadable prose found in most professional academic journals.
