(Can anyone suggest a way to do this?)	For example, today this item appears on Scripting News:		CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/08/impeachment/">White House responds to Byrd comments</a>. Now I wonder why CNN missed the scoop <i>they got,</i> as reported in DaveNet last week.	I think it would be cool if the editor could insert a keyword, for example "Clinton" into the web page object so that if someone did a search of Scripting News for "Clinton" this item would turn up. You could even have links to pre-configured searches for specified keywords as another (automated) means of site organization. 	You could have a table of contents page with an item, "Clinton", linked to 	<a href="http://search.userland.com/default?m=25&s=1&q=Clinton">http://search.userland.com/default?m=25&s=1&q=Clinton</a>	The site editor wouldn't need to manually update this page everytime another item about Clinton was added to the site, but would be able to <i>control</i> which items showed up on that page by using the keyword feature.<p><p>
