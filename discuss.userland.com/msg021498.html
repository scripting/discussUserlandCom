"HTTP plus HTML–was probably the last instance where standards of global importance were designed and implemented without commercial interference." I agree with everything in his article but this. I have hope. Too often the sources of "commercial interference" awake too late, a defacto standard already exists. Plenty of people thought it was all over in the early 90s while the Web was catching on. Actually I think that's a good time to gestate  new ideas without commercial interference.<br><br><a href="http://www.inside.com/story/Story_Cached/0,2770,9675_13_30_1,00.html">Inside.Com</a>: "The looming combination of high-speed connectivity to American homes, ever-increasing desktop processing power and home data storage capacity plus peer-to-peer file sharing is more incendiary than we ever allowed ourselves to imagine."<br><br><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/462894.asp?cp1=1">WSJ</a>: "The public-relations backlash from putting users in jail would cause them more problems than they now face."<br><br>Stewart Alsop: <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/alsop/0,5238,55251,00.html">Wireless Web on Phones?

This is a new kind of Macintosh experience, one that's arguably better in many ways, but one that seasoned users may find difficult to adjust to.

They added lots of 'easy-to-use' features like optional keywords and named variables that pop into and out of existence at unexpected places. The result is a morass that drives experienced programmers to distraction and is totally inaccessible to novices." <br><br>	Later he says: "What I really want is a Java-like language that can access the Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) on the Mac." <br><br>	You might want to give Radio UserLand a try. <br><br>	Mark Aldritt sent a <a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/JavaScriptOSA/index.html">pointer</a> to his JavaScript OSA component.<br><br><b>aggregator.root<a name="aggregatorroot">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/19#aggregatorroot" title="Permanent link to 'aggregator.root' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Frontier developers: I'm looking for a community leader to take custody of aggregator.root after I release it. I've got the whole thing working on my desktop now. There are a few glitches, and bits that I want to straighten out before releasing the code. This is an experiment for the Frontier community. Forks would be permitted, but there would be a single thread that's endorsed by UserLand. The only limit is that the code may not be ported to other environments.<br><br>	The perfect person for this job would be someone who has deep experience in the runtime model for Frontier servers. From a political standpoint, someone who's liked in the community, and someone who likes working with me and my team. It would involve a part-time commitment for a few weeks, to document and test and enhance the code. After that I'd expect the project to wind down, to respond to requests for help from people who are running aggregators, and coordinate further work. There would be a Manila site for documentation and download, and a companion mail list. <br><br>	If you're interested send me a private email. I believe aggregator.root is worth an investment by the community, and that this could be a template for projects we can do together in the future. <br><br><b>Morning stuff<a name="morningStuff">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/19#morningStuff" title="Permanent link to 'Morning stuff' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Scripting News will be abbreviated today, I'm speaking at a conference in San Jose at 11AM, so there won't be much time to find and link to stuff this morning.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/09-19-2000/0001316464&EDATE=B">Sun is buying Cobalt</a>.

Cobalt was a shining star. P2P routes around outages. I guess it's going to be another "open source" milked to death by middlemen. I'd like to think there's another Cobalt around the corner, waiting for us to love them and wanting that love. And I hope someday there are technologists who want to work with other technologists without having middlemen who are scared to be looked at running the show. We've been in that loop for so many years. <br><br>	Technology requires integrity, you can't lie to the compiler, and integrity can't happen without people looking at what you do and raising questions when they need to be <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss">raised</a>. <br><br>	Thanks for listening.<br><br>
