You still have to figure out what it is.<p>

Perhaps foodtv.com tried to leave more stuff uncached than was wise; perhaps they underestimated the number of open database connections they would need; perhaps their database structure is overly complex so that typical queries take too long... Tuning seems to be an important part of a typical Story Server implementation. It's that scary engineering big iron thing again.<p>

My number one guess is that the foodtv site emphasises user searching. Lots and lots of concurrent full-text searches will hit any RDBMS hard. Suddenly things that worked great when you were developing, when you stress-tested, fall over under load.
