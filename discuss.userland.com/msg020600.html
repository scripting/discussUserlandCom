Zzzzing! You got me.<p>

Thanks Paul, for bringing me back to earth! ;-)<p>

I admit that I haven't checked out any of the games in the open source community. I'm sure the engines you have cited are as good or better than the commercial ones.<p>

But there is alot more to a game than just the code. I just can't imagine how the open source community could create a game with the depth, consistancy, and playability of Diablo. Maybe I don't have a very good imagination.<p>

I'd love to be proven wrong!
