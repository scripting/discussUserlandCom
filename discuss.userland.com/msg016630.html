The big one is let's work together. Somehow when I say things that piss people off they come to me. When I praise them, which I have done many times, they don't. It has something to do with human nature. I don't do it deliberately. I did get angry when I read the Raymond quote, it reminded me of the difficulty that this stuff caused a couple of years ago. I wish O'Reilly would read the stuff about patents. I can't make him do that of course.<p>
