I just now got the commercial release of frontier six after poking around with the F5.0 shareware.  I feel like I have a powerful packhorse - I just need to learn how to put the saddle on :)<p>

Dave - it would be cool if you could find a way to have some kind of faceless core db engine that could talk to other programs.<p>

I am a die hard Dreamweaver user, and I've created countless extensions for it (<a href="http://alaji.home.mindspring.com/dreamweaver/">http://alaji.home.mindspring.com/dreamweaver/</a>) and now I want to make sure I can integrate these two tools together.  I've seen objects and such for Tango, Apache, etc. etc. What I want to  do now is talk to folks about building Frontier objects and stuff for DW.<p>

But first - it's time to walk through the "Getting Started with Frontier" page - for me.  I want to start "from scratch" and build up. I know some things about 5.0 but I will try to forget that so I learn 6.0 as it's own creature.  And perhaps sometime in the future you will see Frontier apps coming from me - just as Ive done for dreamweaver.
