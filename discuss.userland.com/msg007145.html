The basic
proposal is to allow (example in Perl):
    open(IFH, "http://davenet.userland.com");
as well as the conventional:
    open(IFH, "h:/metapage/userland/davenet/index.html");<p>

Using the under-used HTTP PUT directive, this idea could be extended
to the writing of URLs.  (Now that WebDAV is here, this becomes much
more practical.)  Specifically, to write a Web page one would do
(in Perl):
    open(OFH, ">http://davenet.userland.com");
(the Perl syntax for creating/overwriting a file).  File -> New and
File -> Open could then be extended to just accept a URL as the
location.  If someone really has a local file called:
    <a href="http://davenet.userland.com">http://davenet.userland.com</a>
(which they could on Unix/Linux), then they can just access it from
File -> Open using:
    <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/http://davenet.userland.com">./http://davenet.userland.com</a>
as the file name.  There's really no reason (IMHO) to separate the
processing of local files and URLs, as URLs are so easily
distinguished from local files under most OSes (at least under
Win3x/9x/NT, Unix/Linux, VAX/VMS, and (I think) MVS).
