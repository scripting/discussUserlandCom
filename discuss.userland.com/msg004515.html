now, as an outline user, but not a Frontier programmer, if you could make
this work on a slightly higher level, with the technology hidden just a
little more fully, you know, with things like menu commands to make tables
and stuff, well, then it'd be even that much more useful.<p>

have you been following the technography thread? are you aware of any tool
that would allow me to broadcast outlines on the fly, as they are being
built, over the internet, with minimal latency?
