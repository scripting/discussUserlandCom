My interest is setting up multiple channels internally where people can go to get current info on a project (within a pharmaceutical company).  This would be a killer use of this whole channel business since often work is done by many people at different locations.<p>

First, I assume that I need to come up with some way to set up my channel in the format described at <a href="http://www.scripting.com/midas/cdf.html">http://www.scripting.com/midas/cdf.html</a>.  I guess the way everybody does this is through scripting pulling stuff from the database, etc.  Second, guess I need to set up frontier to 'serve' the channels and then get that serving function pointed at my channel.  I can't seem to find any reference on how to do this.
