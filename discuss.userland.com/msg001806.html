They are a peripheral, a way to carry a bit of your data with you.  Content-rich sites like many of the news pages are perfect fodder for reading via the Palm III.  But when it comes time to, say, order a book from Amazon, the desktop is where one should be.<p>

A threaded discussion like this one isn't going to work well on AvantGo.  AvantGo allows a user to go n links deep, but doesn't differentiate between links - it just keeps going and going, following every single possibility.  And for now the maximum it can hold is 256K, so if I ask for even one link deep from scripting.com I can't get a week's worth of links.<p>

I really like the Scripting News page for AvantGo.  It's one day's worth of news, it's concise, there are no frames to deal with, and it's very Palm friendly.  Thanks Dave.
