From reading some posts about AFS support on the <A HREF="http://www.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/">Linux-Kernel mailing list</A>, the binary module interface appears to have changed several times between fix releases of the 2.0 kernel.  This is a kernel that is claimed to be a <B>production</B> release.<p>

I think these sorts of issues -- in addition to the forcing-Unix-down-users-throats quality that a lot of Linux development has -- are what Faisal was referring to in his comment on developer maturity.
