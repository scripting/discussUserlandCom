You can set SIMS to store individual emails as individual files, or in a single file. The format used is easily interpreted by Frontier (i.e. it's plain text :)<p>

One of the things I do with Frontier on our server is have it look for new messages in a special "watched" account in the folder where SIMS stores its mail. When a new email comes in for this account, Frontier grabs it, parses it, and puts it in a Filemaker database. 
In this case Frontier just needs to act as an interpreter and gatekeeper.<p>

So it strikes me that Mr. Soroos' excellent work could be leveraged to work with SIMS or EIMS with a minimum of fuss. I've been asked by a couple of users if I could offer web-based email, and so I've cause to explore this further. Hmmm....
