I was simply replying to <A HREF="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/08/01/wheresTheMessiah">Dave's comment</A>:
<blockquote>
<I>"the service agreements of home connectivity providers are as busted as the distribution system of the music companies. Users are prohibited from running servers in their homes."</I>
</blockquote><p>

I don't think our SAs are "busted".<p>

My main point is that if you change what kind of service you expect to get, you should also expect to pay for it.<p>

I provide basic $20/mo. service for <B>users</B>. Users, on the average, are online about 10% of the time. My margins are fine. However if I'm going to provide service for a <B>server</B>, this is a completely different beast! Servers don't sleep, eat, leave the house, etc. like people do. If they are connected 24/7, (dialup) then I've got a $40 <B>direct</B> cost, and plenty of indirect ones as well. The margins aren't just thin, they're non-existant!<p>

I'd be happy to rewrite my service agreement for anyone willing to pay for the service that they will receive.
