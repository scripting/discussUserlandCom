That's why I don't buy an entirely open source world. <p>

I don't buy this dot.commie stuff either.  <p>

It's all about who controls the distribution, the pipeline.  <p>

What I gathered from those articles is not that musicians don't get any money, but they do not get the appropriate portion of the money because they have no control over their own works.  <p>

Just like book or software authors currently enjoy right now, to the dismay of the open/source bandwagon.<p>

Courtney Love made very clear that money is an issue.  I agree with her.  I would like the Napster folk to really think about how they are routing around the artist just like the record companies do.<p>

How do you compensate the author, the person who is creating the work in the first place, in such a world now that the cat is out of the bag?<p>

Are we saying that being a musician is not worthy of compensation?  Selling t-shirts doesn't cut it.
