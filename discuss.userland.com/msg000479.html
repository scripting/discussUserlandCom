Actually, that's not quite true. What DID happen is that it would not stop accepting connections, so the existing queries never completed, so NOBODY got pages back -- the old clients or the new. :( Then you'd have to shutdown and restart the server manually -- which wasn't a trivial task when it was hundreds of miles away on an OS that doesn't have a built-in telnet daemon.<p>

Those were some annoying days... Grrr. Too bad we ditched it before I got a chance to learn Tcl.
