wouldn't send messages unless either the FROM user had a mailbox on
the server or the TO user had a mailbox on the server.</i><p>

If that's the only spam prevention, the mailserver is pretty brain dead. From lines are trivial to forge, so the protection that that provides is pretty much nil.<p>

<i>It's not clear yet whether we can configure a mail server's SPAM
filter to allow ANY user TO/FROM as long as the mail request came 
from within a network, or specific IP address.</i><p>

That's the way intelligent servers do it.<p>

SIMS (www.stalker.com) does this really nicely on the mac for free, and should be able to handle any concievable mail load that frontier could throw at it.<p>

On NT I'm not so sure what your options are.<p>

Unix has sendmail, although if you were willing to configure this, you'd already know about it.<p>
