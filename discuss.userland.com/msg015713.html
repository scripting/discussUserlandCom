UserLand is one of those companies.<p>

For months I had been trying to get my guys to do their own weblogs, and then when they finally did, I started seeing things posted there that used to only be on our internal discussion group. Quite a shock, I had to say to myself "you wanted them to do this" quite a few times to get calm about it.<p>

Now it's a normal part of our workflow. They have become popular weblogs among our users, and this allows us to cover more territory, things I might not put on Scripting News make it onto their sites, and even better, I learn more about what my company is doing by reading their site. In the end it works because I trust these guys, and of course, they are worthy of the trust.<p>

<a href="http://www.inessential.com/">http://www.inessential.com/</a> is Brent Simmons' weblog and<p>

<a href="http://www.spicynoodles.com/">http://www.spicynoodles.com/</a> is Andre Radke's.<p>

Another note, now when hiring someone new I prefer if they already have a weblog, like Jake Savin, who we just hired:<p>
