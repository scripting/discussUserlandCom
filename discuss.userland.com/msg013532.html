Plus you will be able to have a windows-like look and feel - or a totally bizarro new-style look and feel. All of the widgets are styleable via css - the point being that when you build an app using mozilla+xul it will have the same look across all platforms - mac,pc,linux,osx,solaris, etc. etc. if you so desire. The point is _choice_ you will have a choice whether you want it to look the same across all, or if you choose to make it look "native".
