Furthermore, the argument presented is pretty much diametrically opposed to what I understand to be Dave's stance regarding Napster and copyrighted music. He's likening sharing existing CD content using Napster to pirating copies of Windows 2000 (or for that matter Frontier.)<p>

It is at least a consistent argument.<p>
