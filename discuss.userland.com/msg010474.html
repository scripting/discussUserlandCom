It's very different, in fact it's the mirror-image of the InfoWorld policy, and derived from their old policy.<p>

If, after deliberating, InfoWorld left their original policy in place, I had decided that I would not link to them.<p>

In other words, I required permission.<p>

Now I'm saying that in order to syndicate a story flow, I require permission. I see a copyright notice on the home page. That's it, no permission, as I see it.<p>

RSS file? That's permission.<p>

I didn't tell you what to do, btw, I just told you what I am doing.
