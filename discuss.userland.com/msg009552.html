But to claim that exception, you generally can only quote small passages for the purposes of comment; members of the press     have been allowed to quote entire tracts, but then that would mean that the standard press handling of requests for confidentiality would also apply here.</i><p>

Just some clarification on Fair Use (I have to give a short speech about it today :-)<p>

You don't have to be a member of the press.  You're allowed to quote for any criticism or commentary.  Generally speaking you should ask four questions in determining fair use:<p>

<b>What is the character of the use?</b>  Non-profit commentary definitely weighs toward fair use.<p>

<b>What is the nature of the work to be used?</b> Factual material is in favor of fair use.<p>

<b>How much of the work will you use?</b> Large is against fair use.<p>

<b>If this kind of use were widespread, what effect would it have on the market for the original or for permissions?</b><p>

A key question would be whether e-mail is considered to be publication, which I don't think has been determined yet.<p>

Even if you make a determination that a case isn't fair use, you can often get permission, e.g. Antique Software violates item three (large quotation -- kinda), but you can still get permission.<p>
