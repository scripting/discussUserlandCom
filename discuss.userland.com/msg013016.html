It seems like it should work...my understanding is the Macintosh Compatibility Environment (blue box) is 8.5.1 and applications that don't mess with directly with hardware will run.<p>

An even more bizarre question, if frontier runs, could the frontier under blue box communicate with apache that's running in the unix environment on the same mac?  I realize this would probably not be efficient but it would be an interesting experiment. <p>

I'm thinking about upgrading my server...which means both frontier and webstar server suite 4.0 would have to work.
