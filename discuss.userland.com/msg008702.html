1. The burglar alarm went off at our office at 3 AM one morning. I had been hacking until 1, so I didn't relish driving in to see what was up. It would have been great if I could have remotely turned on the lights, looked around via a camera, & reset the alarm. As it turned out, it was a false alarm. This happens every month or so. Maybe a German Shepherd company mascot would be a more practical solution... ;)<p>

2. I forgot to check the pressure gauge on our pool filter one morning. Our pool filter is located in the basement, which is convenient for winterizing (Cincinnati climate), but very inconvenient if a pipe breaks due to a clogged filter. It doesn't take long for that pump to empty our pool into the basement! (file that under lessons learned the hard way) I'd love to be able to check that gauge from work or wherever, or even have it page me if it reached a certain level.
