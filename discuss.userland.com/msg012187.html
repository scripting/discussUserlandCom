In some countries you do (even without the Internet).  Most modern TVs have alternate talk-tracks--they just don't get used for much, except alternate languages sometimes.  <p>

In Japan the daily news is broadcast in Japanese, but also in English on the alternative track.  Same is true for English-speaking movies, which you can watch in English or dubbed.  <p>

Similarly, some baseball games have a regular commentary, and also an alternate track that sounds like a bunch of guys having a beer and talking about the game (I never quite understood the details).<p>
