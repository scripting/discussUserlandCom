Ari Davidow, on XML editors: <a href="http://www.ivritype.com/xml/">Allegations of Functionality in search of reality</a>. "I have encountered none of the enthusiasm for specific tools that foreshadowed the transition from editors to word processors (dig that Wordstar!), or that accompanied the rise in HTML (HomeSite! No, PageMill!). I have found no comparative reviews or links to favorite XML editors on the XML interest websites."<p>

My personal preference, Frontier's <a href="http://www.outliners.com/images/frontier6/prefsDemoWizardOutline.gif">outliner</a>, makes a fine XML editor. I really don't need or want anything more than this, at this time.<p>

Juancarlo Anez: <a href="http://community.borland.com/devnews/article/1,1714,10391,00.html">Start the Revolution without me</a>. "Like many programmers, I have used and written open-source software for a long time. I'm glad that we now have a phrase -- open source -- to describe what we've been doing. But I object to narrow definitions that exclude workable, time-honored, and popular practices. Now that we have a buzzword, people are trying to cram political and economic agendas into the term." <i>Excellent!</i><p>
