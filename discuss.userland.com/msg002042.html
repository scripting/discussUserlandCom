Interestingly enough, "menu sharing" should be very easy with MacOS X, if one utilizes the "Services" functionality. The developer registers application our services at (installtime? runtime? dunno) with the OS, then it goes into the "Services" menu which is system-wide and context sensitive. The user gets a "Frontier" submenu in the "Services" menu with available commands. The number of apps which support "menu sharing" in this manner could theoretically be *all of them* (in the case of apps written to the OS X API)<p>
