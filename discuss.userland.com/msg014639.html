Arne Graesser who is codeveloping Frontier-applications togeher with Christoph Pingel and me at the Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe (Germany) implemented this beautiful piece of Fronier-code. He is really using UserTalk in a very innovative fashion. So read what he has to say about his FrontierChat and then enjoy it.<p>

yours remotely, Tom Fuerstner<p>

How it works :
I used the session support suite of Samuel Reynolds.
This suite makes it possible to give each user a sessionID , which will be
stored in user.session.sessions.
Read more about this at : <a href="http://www.spinwardstars.com/frontier/suites/session.html">http://www.spinwardstars.com/frontier/suites/session.html</a><p>

My Goal was , to build a chatsystem which is totally embedded and hosted by
UserlandFrontier.
So far , i arrived at a point ,to host a chat for different users in
different chatrooms.
The advance for Frontier is , to make live conversation possible , without
using external tools.<p>

The big advantage of this system is , that the only thing the user needs is
his(her) webbrowser.
This offers the next huge possibility:
U can allow the user to use HTML-TAGS as a tool for this chat.
At the moment , i only use this to change the user-color.<p>

Until now , i didn't arrive to test the system under huge traffic.
The system works really intelligent , meaning all the data that is
necessary to identify the user is taken out of the
userdata , stored with the sessionID , and rendered live with every frame
and every page.
This makes it easy to change the users preferences , cause all u have to do
is change the userdata using his sessionID.<p>

I have to do some  sourcecode commentation and correction, to share it with
u , but that might take a little while.
Until then , it would be a great help for me to have some of u testing
around a little bit .

Critics and suggestions are as welcome ask questions on the tool.<p>

My big hope is , that somebody will find a way , to parse the text to the
browser continously 
without using frame-refreshing (and without using external software).I
didn't arrive yet to get the mainresponder 
doing that for me.
