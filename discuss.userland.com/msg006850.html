It has been in the news over the years but never seems to come out of the back pages of most mainstream publications. FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting) had labeled it one of the most important uncovered stories of either 1997 or 1998 (I forget). <p>

Privacy and Cryptography are two of the things I follow on my News/WebLog at <a href="http://www.MacRonin.com/news.html">http://www.MacRonin.com/news.html</a> Below are some items I culled from my archive pages (Back over 2 years) that you might be interested in.<p>

Maybe folks will start DISCUSSing the topic and take it seriously.<p>

TechWeb - Report: <a href="http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19990518S0004">U.S. Uses Key Escrow To Steal Secrets</a>.
European plans for controlling encryption software are nothing to do with law enforcement and everything to do with 
	U.S. industrial espionage, according to a report released by the European Parliament on Friday.<p>


	The working document for the Scientific and Technological Options Assessment panel said the United States has tried to 
	persuade European Union countries to adopt its key escrow or key recovery policies -- allowing backdoor access to encryption programs --
	saying this was necessary to read messages exchanged by criminals. <p>


	But the report details how the UKUSA alliance  -- made up of the United Kingdom, United States, 
	Canada, Australia, and New Zealand -- has used its secret Echelon global spying network 
	to intercept confidential company communications and give them to 
	favored competitors. Thomson S.A., located in Paris, and Airbus Industrie, based in  Blagnac Cedex, France, 
	are said to have lost contracts as a result of information passed to rivals.<p>


	"The U.S. government misled states in the EU and [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] 
	about the true intention of its 
	policy," the <a href="<a href="http://www.iptvreports.mcmail.com/stoa_cover.htm">http://www.iptvreports.mcmail.com/stoa_cover.htm</a>">report</a> adds.<p>


	"Between 1993 and 1997 police representatives were not involved in the 
	"NSA" [National Security Agency]-led policy-making process for key recovery. Despite this, during the same 
	period the U.S. government repeatedly presented its policy as being motivated
	by the stated needs of law-enforcement agencies."<p>

	Would you trust your private key to this agency? Since 1956, the NSA has 
	had a secret deal with the Swiss company that supplies the world with 
	crypto<p>


	Once the cipher machines were rigged to include the secret decryption 
	key, the BND and NSA codebreakers could use the transmitted key to read 
	any message sent by Crypto AG's 120 country customers.<p>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/04/biztech/articles/14phone.html">Researchers Crack Code in Cell Phones</a>.
In successfully cracking a widely used encryption method designed to 
	prevent the cloning of digital cellular phones, a group of University of 
	California computer researchers believe they have stumbled across 
	evidence that the system was deliberately weakened to permit government 
	surveillance. <p>


	<I>Hmmm ... very interesting!!! Especially in light of yesterdays mention of an article from
	Covert Action Quarterly mentioning the same thing having been done once before in Switzerland for the NSA.</I>

	According to a draft of the project, which is being discussed by Russian communications agencies, SORM -- the acronym for ``system for ensuring investigative activity'' -- would force all providers of Internet services to install a snooping device in thei
	main computers and build a dedicated information superhighway connecting it with the security agency FSB, formerly the KGB.<p>
