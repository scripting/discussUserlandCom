I think the ability to operate in a disconnected (or asynchronous) mode is a very important one. Being able to send an RPC via XML-RPC and later synch up with the result -- either by polling or by waiting -- will allow me to write apps that are connected intermittently.<p>

FWIW I think CORBA does not have such a facility. They have "oneway" calls with best-effort semantics but you can't get a result back and you can't know that the call actually happened.
