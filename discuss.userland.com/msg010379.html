For a vendor that will supply a linux box that is "guaranteed" to work out of the box, I am very optimistic about SGI linux because:<p>

1) SGI has historically provided very good support for its IRIX unix systems (both hardware and OS) -- it shouldn't be much of a stretch to add linux to the mix. SGI is comfortable and experienced with 24x7 "enterprise-level" support.<p>

2) SGI is putting its money where its mouth is by opening the source of IRIX's XFS file system and porting it to linux. File system scalability and performance has been an issue on linux (as well as some other unix flavors), and XFS is arguably the most "modern" unix file system (full 64bits, mega-terabyte filesystems, journaling, no need for fsck after crashes or power failures, etc). They also support the Samba project (e.g. Jeremy Allison, part of the Samba team, is an SGI employee, who, strangely enough, develops Samba as part of his work at sgi).<p>
