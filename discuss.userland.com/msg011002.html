It is encouraging to hear that Frontier continues making headlines. For over seven years now, Frontier has been running on my desktop while my computer is on.<p>

In the early years ( 1992- 1995) of using Frontier, I took a lot of flack in the corporate world for using Frontier on projects. Frontier never let me down and it performed very well as a workflow processing tool. Glad to hear so many others find Frontier so rewarding too.
