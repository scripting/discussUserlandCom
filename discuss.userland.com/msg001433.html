I've put up a page about IdleTime (I'll need to add a link to the
source) and I'm also more than willing to help fix this little problem
(which might be something I did wrong).<p>

  <<a href="http://www.dijas.com/idletime/">http://www.dijas.com/idletime/</a>><p>

I sent some mail to <a href="mailto:edb@macresource.com">edb@macresource.com</a> on Tuesday, the 8th asking for
more information and never got a reply regarding the Apple Tech Support
rep who blamed IdleTime. I also cc'd Dave (using <a href="mailto:dwiner@well.com">dwiner@well.com</a>) which
he might never have seen.<p>

I know the code and I'll certainly help. At the same time I've been
running the extension on every box I've ever used for a long, long time.
I run lots and lots of applications (right now I've got 12 apps running
under 8.5.1; 184 FCBs with 145 of those in use) and I've never seen the
problem being mentioned.<p>

If there is indeed a problem, it's being nudged into view by something
else.<p>
