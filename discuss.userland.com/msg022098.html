More people are downloading it, we're still fixing bugs and creating new ones. The docs directory needs a re-org.

When it's ready for the masses the coffee mug (to the left) will become a permanent fixture on Scripting News. Wes Felter had some difficulty with localhost vs 127.0.0.1. I have to write a page explaining the "Thousands of Channels" that Radio can deliver. I want to be able to post to my <a href="http://www.scripting.com/blog/index.html">Radio Blog</a> via email.
