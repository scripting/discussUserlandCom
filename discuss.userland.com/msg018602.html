If I see someone downloading Tortoise, 808 State and Lee Perry from me I know they're going to have a similar taste in music and so I go and look at them. (Although it'd be a hell of a lot easier if "sort by username" worked on the download screen)</P><p>

<P>I'm still not entirely convinced that collab-bots like Firefly <i>can't</i>
work... I just think that they weren't very well tuned. They'd almost always
give you stuff that was quite good but relatively middle-of-the-road, and no
use for hunting down things in particular genres because genres are so hard
to do well in music these days. And also because the users didn't have much
control over their settings, and they could only rate on a single linear
scale.</P><p>

<P>The frustration I had with Firefly was the usual "Yeah, I think REM's good,
but I think Bark Psychosis is brilliant" problem. Collab filters drive you
<i>away</i> from niches, towards the middle ground, which is pointless in a
recommendation system, at least it is for me, because I'd rather be
recommended interesting niche stuff most of the time, but instead it gives me
Elvis Costello. Or maybe it's being a kind of classics teacher, telling me I
should spend some time with the greats before I wander off looking for quick
thrills. (This is where my guilt for not listening to enough
Beatles/Stones/Curtis/Public Enemy comes in)</P><p>

<P>Here's an idea, with the usual discalimer because it's only just come to me
and I'm really tired: how about a Firefly where you can make up your own
rating scales for music, as many as you like - so you could, if you wanted
to, rate music on overall quality, vocal performance, cheesiness, technoness,
chilledness, etc. You, as the user, make up whichever scales you like for
music and then you rate stuff on those scales. And you don't have to explain
what these scales mean, at least, not to the bot - you can put in a
description string so that other users browsing your scales can see what they
mean, according to you. And then, um, something like having the bot compare
scales between people and find matches in the scales, rather than matches on
individual albums - so if I have a scale called "technoness" and you have a
scale called "bounciness" and the bot compares our ratings on those scales
for albums and sees that we've both given Basement Jaxx a high score and
Johnny Mathis a low score (except with a much larger sample base, obviously,
to get some differentiation between "bounciness" and
"grandma-wouldn't-like-it-ness") and then decides that the two scales are
roughly equivalent. Then you can log on and say "I want a new album,
something good, quite bouncy, with occasional chilled bits", except you say
that by doing it in terms of the scales you've defined, and it goes out and
looks for scales that match your scales.</P><p>

<P>It'd be interesting to build the sort of arbitrary-scale system I talk about
into Napster, with no bot intelligence at all - just a way you can show
people browsing your stuff how you rate each track. (That's the other problem
with rating albums rather than tracks - saying "occasional chilled bits" as
opposed to "the whole thing is averagely chilled" is impossible with a single
chilledness score rating an entire album)</P><p>
