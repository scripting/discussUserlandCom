When Dave points me to a site, I often visit is because
I think he's got an eye for ideas. So I jumped over to<p>

<<a href="http://www.warchild.nl/index.html">http://www.warchild.nl/index.html</a>><p>

To see what the fuss was about. I browse with graphics off,
so the pictures didn't render for me, and the text is in Dutch.
So I scolled down....<p>

Holy Cow! The nav bar on the left scrolled into the visible
area of my browser. If I make my browser wide and short, only the
graphics are in view, which makes navigation tough, but the IDEA
is cool.<p>

It just goes to show that there are new ideas out there. I still
don't like wasting a column on the left where content could be.
I prefer a nice navigation pathname with names in the heirarchy
that I can click to get where I need to be, but this scrolling
navbar has some merit.<p>

Comments?<p>
