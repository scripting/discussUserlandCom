Conversely, what if a script was doing it, but was DOG slow; slow as a person doing the same thing. In fact, I'm sure there ARE scripts out there somewhere that are aggregating this stuff for personal use, that are probably not the fastest things in the world.<p>

To be honest, I think we're on a slippery slope here...and one I kind of expected. Is it automation, or the SPEED of the process?
