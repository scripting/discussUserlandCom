But not so much as my friend (and others?) would have liked.  He's looking for a my.yahoo.com  ... with the "channel" features like my.userland<p>

Dave .. can you add a "my bookmarks" area? ... so that users can add their own static bookmarks?   I know that this would be making my.userland more like a "portal"  .. but sans advertising ...  I simply LOVE whois.userland .. check out www.myhq.com for a nice "my bookmarks" page.<p>
