epinions is a good example of what I've been saying all along: the issue is the accountability of those posting. epinions supports "reviewing the reviewers," which is as it should be. They've created a market of opinions. If you believe in free markets, then you should, by definition, believe that the value of anyone's opinion on epinions will become more accurate over time (i.e. as more reviewers review the reviewers), which will draw more people to the site, which will draw more reviews, which will make the results more accurate, which will draw more people... this is why it's an excellent web model.<p>
