I totally agree.  In fact, if Micheal Dell is as sharp as everyone thinks he is we will see AirDell ... the same pod with a Dell logo.  It would make my year if Dell, Gateway, Compaq, and IBM would announce AirWhatever products and machines with antennas and a slot to snap in the same $99 client card that Apple sells.<p>

Of course ... AirDell might be a dog of a product name.  ;-)
