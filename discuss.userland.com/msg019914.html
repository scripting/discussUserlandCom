Progress in standards is slow. Crawl, walk, run.<p>

I have great hopes for the DAML efforts that are trying to incorporate standard ontologies, inference rules, etc. into an RDF framework.<p>

Inferencing in Cyc (with about 0.5M rules) was very hard. Inferencing in any language with any expressiveness is undecidable. Inferencing on the web is going to be much harder. And therefore more fun!<p>

I also believe in the use of representations with a declarative semantics, even without inference rules. Thats another reason why RDF is so important!

Is there anywhere that I can get an explanation of all this?  To my mind, this is the problem with RDF.  I'm averagely smart and I don't understand a word of what this means.  That's not to say it's not important, but where's the one page explanation of each of these terms:<p>

Logical rules: seems to be being used in a different way from everyday use<p>

Ontologies: ditto<p>

Inference rules/inferencing: ditto<p>

Representations with declarative semantics:?<p>

DAML:?<p>

It appears that all these terms are being used in a technical sense, but their everyday use does <b>not</b> have a technical meaning.<p>
