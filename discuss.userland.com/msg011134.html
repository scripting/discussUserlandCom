I agree that you have to define the procedures on top of XML-RPC. That's the answer to Mark Aldritt's thread on XML-RPC.COM. Did people miss this? We specified the DG interface. We could totally XMLize the spec and would be happy to do so. We also specified a search engine interface. We will soon specify a prefs distribution interface. This is key. XML-RPC is a layer, in the layer above XML-RPC are the scriptable apps, the analogs to Word, BBEdit, Quark, etc.
