It would have to run outside a firewall.  You could run one, or someone else.  Manilla would have to be changed a bit to support it.  It would have to be located outside a firewall(or inside a firewall with a hole puched for it.)  <p>

A routing enclosure would have to be wrapped around the Server->Pike messages.  It would have to tell the proxy server which connection to send it to.  Perhaps just a user identifier, like the email address in the prefs.  The proxy would strip off this routing tag, and match the email addr with the connection, then send the message that way.  Or, rather than a routing tag, just another option inside of an existing tag.  I am not sure how Manilla aquires Pike's IP addr, I assume it just sends things back to the http requester.
