Do popular music groups even make most of their money off of records? It might be an extreme example, but based on the buying habits of the 12-year old girl next door I suspect the Backstreet Boys make far more revenue on their merchandising than on their music (probably because the merchandise is of higher quality than their music).<p>

BTW, the MP3 format has caused me to increase my CD buying rather than diminished it -- but I don't pirate illegal MP3s so I might be in the minority there.<p>

The same thing goes for writing and the other media forms as wellby the way -- you can use the reputation garnered on the Internet to sell ancillary products. I've been working, for example, on using the reputation I've been building in a couple of areas to garner speaking engagements and other sorts of business opportunities.
