mainResponder.members.sendMail is called from mainResponder.members.checkMembership, which in turn is called from mainResponder.respond before the requested object is built. I don't there is currently a good way for you to hook into the authentication process. It looks like you will have to hack one of the involved mainResponder scripts.  :-(
