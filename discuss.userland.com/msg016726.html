Anyway, if I recall correctly, $ was what MacHTTP (later WebSTAR) used  to separate a CGI script URL from its parameters.  Since Frontier's web scripting capabilities originally ran behind a host web server, this was how you passed parameters to CGI scripts written in Frontier.  Frontier's built-in web server carries on this convention.
