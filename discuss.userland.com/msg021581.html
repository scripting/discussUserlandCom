You're probably thinking of Dan Libby. <p>

Your pointer to the Syndication list was actually a pointer to the Decentralization list. Very different cultures and scope of work. <p>

Dan Brickley did give me pushback, but the discussion ended (on the FoRK list) with him asking me what was stolen and me explaining what was stolen. Once I did that, I think most people understood the issue. Before the switch to RDF+Namespaces I was a leader in Web syndication, after your move, I was not. Pretty simple? How did that happen?<p>

I never claimed ownership of RSS. Be more careful Tim. I specifically disclaimed ownership of it, repeatedly. Further, my work on <scriptingNews> format predates Netscape's involvement by over a year. That was merged with RSS 0.90 to form RSS 0.91. Go look at the specs. They tell the story much better.<p>

It's really weird that a person of your stature, who has no direct knowledge of the events, is trying to write me out of my own creative process. Tim, right there, that's my major complaint with you and your company.
