I reckon that there'll never be EditThisPage for Linux either since it seems, according to the rant, that it takes advantage of MS-only features. Since when does everyone need to dance to the Microsoft tune in order to be hip on the internet?<p>

A clarification of what is meant by that rant would be helpful. I know you don't mean that all OS's need to follow the MS proprietary lead in order to be able to access the web fully.<p>

Sincerely,
Eric M. Winslow
