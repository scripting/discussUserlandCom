This is an absurd suggestion, and unnecessarily personal. <p>

Firstly, the new US government regulations only apply to US government agency sites. The information on these sites is <I>already</I> controlled by government. The issue here is whether people with certain disabilities have as much access to this information as the average US internet-using citizen.<p>

Secondly, the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines have been in open development for more than a year. There is nothing shadowy or obscure about this process. Anybody could have (and did) chime in with their two cents at anytime.<p>

Thirdly, I'm not a US citizen nor am I responsible for any US government sites. I design for accessibility because I respect my readers. I offered advice to others who wished to respect their readers.<p>

Mr Dambournet, can you please explain to me why you think that a government-employed webmaster has the right to decide which US citizens are allowed access to their agency's information?<p>

Or perhaps you can explain what browser effect is so damn cool that you can't be bothered to offer an alternative.
