I found the problem. It was <a href=http://www.falken.net/webfree/>Webfree</a>, which was set to block cookies. Of course I had that feature shut off before I nuked my old system, but either it defaults to blocking cookies, or I turned that back on by mistake.<p>

Sorry for wasting folks' time with a cockpit error (or as I used to say when I worked in Tech Support, <i>The problem seems to be somewhere between the keyboard and the seat.</i>) What I don't understand is how I thought cookies were working for other sites. Maybe the heat wave we had here last week may have caused some brain damage.<p>
