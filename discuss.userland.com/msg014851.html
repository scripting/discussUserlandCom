I will be following close on Brent's heels (I guess) as I will be building my own Linux system (on a Dell) to demo Frontier/Manila (via WINE, pending an alternative) as well as the ArsDigita ACS system, in the next couple of weeks<p>

perhaps I will document my experience as well, on my editthispage.com site, until I can cajole my company to get me a commercial Frontier license (we are reluctant to invest in NT)<p>
