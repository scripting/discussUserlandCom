I had posted a note recently about an idea for shared authentication, but now I can't find it.  It was basically a third-party keyserver but with a mechanism where the key was signed by the keyserver so the web server doesn't need to contact the third-party on every use.<p>

The technique specifically does not address authorization, formal mutual trust, or user info (the latter being part of linking membership systems).
