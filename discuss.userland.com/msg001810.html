I think the outliner format really comes into it's own on palm-size screens - you can quickly expand and collapse topics and make the most of your limited space.<p>

I tend not to read web pages on the PalmPilot but I do write and read a lot of email. I would really like some sort of generalized conduit system that would let me share outlines and email messages with Frontier and other applications (perhaps XML-based?)
