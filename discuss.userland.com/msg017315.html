I was cruising down the highway between Savona & Genova at 150...  A notorious highway for having 90 degree bends, rather than curves...  Then this smart car whizzes by at 160+
I was impressed by its handling - obviously a very low centre of gravity.  What more do you want? The speed limit is at 130...<p>

For Dave's sake, it was meant to prepare folks for electric city-only cars (like the Renault Twingo); as folks get used to it, cities can start closing off to all gas-propulsed traffic and move to electric-powered vehicles of similar dimensions.<p>

Great advertiSIGN vehicle too, as North Americans notice ;o)  Keep your eyes open for mine!
