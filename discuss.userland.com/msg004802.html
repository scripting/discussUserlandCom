She explains that she heard that you were the one who programmed the on-line technography capability into Frontier. She’s very excited about your contribution because it lead to a revolution in journalism, and she desperately wants to interview you to learn more about your genius.<p>

You ask her to call you back in a couple hours. In the mean time, she’ll send you an e-mail, confirming the interview time and giving you the URL for your meeting.<p>

She calls. You answer. You click on the URL and find yourself on the web, on a Frontier-like page with a 36-point banner reading: Code Warrior Fights for New Journalism.”<p>

“So,” she says, “what inspired you?”<p>

“Well,” you respond, modestly, “it wasn’t really my idea in the first place. I read about it on the Frontier Discussion Group.”<p>

As you speak, you see a new subheader appear on the Webpage: “Gets inspiration from on-line Discussion Group”<p>

“Yes,” you comment, “that’s correct.” <p>

“And,” she adds, “did you realize that it would have such a revolutionary impact on the practice of journalism?”<p>

“Actually,” you answer, “I really was thinking more about Emergency Response teams.”<p>

On the screen you see: “Launch of New Journalism, says Code Warrior, begins with Emergency Response teams”<p>

“Wait a minute,” you say, “it wasn’t Emergency Response Teams, it was my realization that Frontier could serve as a tool for keeping them informed and helping them coordinate tasks.”<p>

“Oh. I think I’ve got it.” Says the interviewer. On the screen you see “The launch of New Journalism, says Code Warrior, began with a new technology for supporting Emergency Response teams.”<p>

“Yeah,” you say, “that’s much better. Isn’t this a great way to work?”<p>

“What do you mean?” asks the journalist.<p>

“I feel like we’re working together on this article. It’s not just you interviewing me. It’s us creating an article, together. I like how I can see myself being heard. I like how I can make sure that you’re taking my words and putting them in the best light. I like how we’re on the same side.”<p>

“That’s a good quote,” says the journalist. “Let me get it”<p>

On the screen: “The idea of New Journalism,” explains the Digital Prophet, “is that it keeps everyone on the same side – the person being interviewed gets to see how he’s being heard.”<p>

“Yeah, and gets to make sure he’s being heard right.”<p>

“, and gets to make sure he’s being heard right.”
