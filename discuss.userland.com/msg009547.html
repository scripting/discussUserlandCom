There are two things I hate when I click on a deep link:<p>

1. a supposed deep link that takes me to a home page instead of the content I clicked for (usually an asp with no obvious path to the "real" info that lead me there), and<p>

2. a deep link to a page that does not have an obvious path back up the site's hierarchy (in case I want to get the "big picture.")
