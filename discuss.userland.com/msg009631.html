Very true!  The client side of Xml-Rpc is <i>almost</i> trivial with any language (scripting or otherwise) with robust XML and HTTP support.  I wrote client code for my KDE Xml-Rpc implementation in a little more than an hour.  The server side has stalled me for a few weeks now as I try to work out some conceptual issues (e.g., how do you embed a multi-client web server into a single threaded application?)
