I'd like to confirm this. As an example, the following is a message posted to the Java-Apache mailing list (imho _the_ hot spot of server side java on unix) some months ago by Jon Stevens, one of the <a href=http://jakarta.apache.org/whoweare.html>core members</a> of the java-apache project:<p>

Yes, it should be possible but would not be the best method imho.<p>

I would use XML-RPC instead <<a href="http://www.xml-rpc.com/">http://www.xml-rpc.com/</a>>.</i><p>

I think the thing to realize is that mind share (and the spot on Linux CD-ROMS it brings) is a bottom-up phenomenon in the Linux world much more that it is with Windows and Mac. And I think it's coming along very nicely.
