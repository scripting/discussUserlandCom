Today is Friday 19 November 1999.<p>

The numerical format for today is 19-11-1999 - all the digits are odd. The next 'odd day' after today will be 1-1-3111 which is well over a thousand years away, and which we will never see; so clearly
something to think about!<p>

The next 'even day' will be 2-2-2000 - the first one since 28-8-888 -
nothing to worry about on that front then!<p>

So, now you have a reason to celebrate today as it'll be your last 'odd day' on Earth!
