Did you read the Albini piece? In the example he shows the band ends up negative $14K and the record company has a positive $711K. What did the band get? The satisfaction of doing a record that a lot of people listened to. Hard work touring. But they're in debt for the privilege. <p>

If you dispute those numbers, fine. But say so. <p>

Further, who controls the distribution? On the Internet, so far, no one. As has been amply evidenced. <p>

The same old tired arguments don't work now that the finances have been exposed. I've read everything I can get my hands on. Listened to NPR's excellent show on it yesterday. The record company exec hung up during the interview! They're cornered man. This isn't business as usual. Things are changing. Old arguments don't work when there's change happening.<p>
