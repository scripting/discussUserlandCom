Nokia actually have shipped in excess of 250K 7110's in Europe as of 10 days ago. The problem is demand far outstrips supply - resellers here in the UK are typically receiving 5-10 per store per week...but they have in many cases several hundred people who are waiting for one.<p>

Good point about the mime type for a WML deck. All the WAP docs are abvailable from <a href="http://www.wapforum.org/">http://www.wapforum.org/</a> in PDF/HTML format.<p>

Merry Christmas and a happy Y2K!<p>
