- "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog." More specifically, e-commerce significantly levels the playing field so that small operations can market almost as easily as large ones.<p>

Based on these two concepts, I think that everyone who has an e-commerce site that implements 1-click should attempt to license 1-click from Amazon; if the license fee is unreasonable for the small sites, then there may be grounds to launch a class-action suit against Amazon for unreasonable license fees (there must be an attorney out there who's willing to take a shot at this target).  If the suit were successful, then the price would be reduced to a point where Amazon would no longer be able to use the patent strategy as a barrier-of-entry to its main competition (Barnes and Noble, for example), and the whole strategy might fail.<p>

This might be an opportunity to show that the Internet economy is really a new one, and that some of the old rules don't apply.<p>

The patent system was supposed to promote technology and sharing of information, while ensuring compensation for inventors; it wasn't supposed to restrict competition.  We might have a chance to make it work that way in this case...
