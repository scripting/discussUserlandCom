The Florida vote count seems to be converging at this late hour. The current count is 48.9% <i>each</i> for Gore and Bush:<p>

Bush: 2,898,508, Gore: 2,897,939<p>

The local news in San Francisco is reporting that the counts are within 6,000 votes, but according to these stats, it's within 1,000 votes at this time.
