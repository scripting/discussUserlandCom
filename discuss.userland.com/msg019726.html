For example, I've got music by Irish artist M&aacute;ire Brennan on my system here.  When I try to view my history.xml with IE5.5, it's default method of viewing returns this:<p>

An Invalid character was found in text content. Line 15, Position 23 <br> 
  <outline text="06. M?e Brennan - Against The Wind" ...<br>
----------------------^<p>

I don't know enough about XML (yet, I'm doing my best to learn) to know if this is an "error" about which we should be concerned or just a limitation of IE5's defaults.<p>
