I think this is the real news: people used to go on and on about the "Steve Jobs reality-distortion field," and a lot of that, I think, had to do with Steve's stubbornness in the face of information that contradicted his strongly-held opinions. What we're seeing now is a Steve Jobs who's more willing to deal with market realities such as the need for vastly improved price:performance ratios in the Mac line and the need for smaller developers with shallower pockets to get into serious Mac development (MPW for free, WebObjects for a very-not-unreasonable price).<p>

This is excellent news, especially given that WebObjects can now be Java-driven as well as Objective-C-driven.
