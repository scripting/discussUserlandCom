There's very little pressure for developers to use the GPL. Stallman may <i>ask</i>, but he'll take "no" for an answer. Or at least I never had any trouble.<p>

<b>GPL Compatibility</b><p>

But there's another, related issue. The GPL doesn't always play nicely with other open source licenses.<p>

Let's say, for example, that you want to combine FooApp with BarApp. You're going to call the resulting program Foo+BarApp, and release it as open source.<p>

FooApp is distributed under the GPL. BarApp is distributed under the Mozilla Public License. Can you combine the two applications into one?<p>

<b>Rules for Combining Applications</b><p>

The GPL has a special rule for combing two applications into one.<p>

The GPL says that if FooApp is GPL'd, and you combine it with BarApp, then <i>Foo+BarApp</i> must be GPL'd. This rule does <i>not</i> apply to BarApp, but <i>only</i> to the combined code.<p>

This is what people usually mean when they call the GPL a "virus".<p>

If BarApp is distributed under the MPL, you can't create Foo+BarApp. But if BarApp is distributed under the XFree86 license, you <i>can</i> create Foo+BarApp.<p>

<b>Python and GPL'd Software</b><p>

<a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnumeric/">Gnumeric</a> is a user-friendly spreadsheet. It's released under the GPL, and it uses Python as a scripting language.<p>

It's OK to combine Python 1.5 with Gnumeric, because the old Python license was very flexible.<p>

But the Python 1.6 license is <a href="http://www.handle.net/python_licenses/python1.6_9-5-00.html">more complex</a>. You may not be able to combine Python 1.6 with Gnumeric anymore.<p>

<b>What Guido Wants</b><p>

Guido wants <i>everybody</i> to use Python. He supports open source developers, commercial developers, proprietary developers, GPL'd developers and just about every other kind of developer.<p>

So Guido chose a very simple, inclusive license. Under the older license, both UserLand <i>and</i> the Gnumeric developers were welcome to use Python.<p>

<b>CNRI Owns Big Pieces of Python</b><p>

But Guido's not the only person who has say over the Python license. He used to work for CNRI, and much of Python belongs to them, since they paid his salary.<p>

After Guido left CNRI, they decided to change the Python license. The Python 1.6 license is still an open source license--but it may no longer be GPL compatible.<p>

Guido, of course, wants to keep using a simple license. But he has to do whatever CNRI asks him to do, because they own his code.<p>

<b>Which Licenses are Compatible with the GPL?</b><p>

The XFree86 license, the MIT X license, the newer BSD license and Guido's Python license are all compatible with the GPL.<p>

The MPL, the NPL, the ZPL, the original BSD license, and the CNRI Python license are not compatible with GPL, or so Stallman's lawyers claim.<p>

Since Stallman wrote the GPL, most people leave the final decision up to his lawyers.<p>

<b>How to Avoid Outages</b><p>

If you want to share code with <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/">major open source projects</a>, it helps to use a GPL-compatible license. You don't have to use the GPL itself, any other compatible license will work just fine.<p>
