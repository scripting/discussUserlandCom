I just have a quick look, and I see the navigation inside sub-sections of the site is really improved with the use of paths &agrave; la Yahoo or Wired (or whatever its called). Now you know where you are and how to go back to the "portal".<p>

About the first page, I like the layout BUT, I think that its too thick.<p>

The two main sections "What is Frontier?" and "Docs" are mucho important, but you get a kind of list of indifferent items.<p>

I think you should make a small comment on each sub-sections letting know the user what he/she is going to find there, and why its important to go there. <p>

Also, I have this alert on Mac/Netscape 4.05<p>


<pre>
missing &#123; before function body.<p>

                function isIE4Win () &#123;
.....................................^

Good work !<p>

And when its going to go prime time, some work for me to convert the old urls in the Frontier Newbie Toolbox to the new urls.
