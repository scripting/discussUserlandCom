There seems to be quite a large disconnect as to how to use Java on Linux as the author moves from the fact of browsers not having Java support to being forces to choose either NT or Solaris because Java can't be deployed on Linux.<p>

First, having Java outside of the browser is a very good thing.  That way you are no longer at the mercy of the browsers to be given the latest JVM.  How long did it take either Netscape or Microsoft to ship with Java 1.1?  At least 9 months after it had been released...  <p>

Second, Java runs fine on Linux.  I use it at home for all of my development and there would be no way I would continue if there were problems.  The <a href="http://java.blackdown.org">Blackdown</a> JVM has been very stable for me and I have a great Linux Java development environment on a laptop and a desktop.<p>

Java on the server is becoming much more popular and depending on the application, Java within the browser might not be the best solution.  But to jump to the conclusion that Java will be doomed to fail because it isn't supported in a browser is very short-sighted and misses the boat completely.<p>
