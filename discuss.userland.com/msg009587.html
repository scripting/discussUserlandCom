They call it Smalltalk Express but it is really the old Digitalk Smalltalk environment.<p>

Back in the mid-90's I spent a lot of time in this environment studying OOP concepts and experimenting with the Win16 APIs. It was refreshing, as a programmer, to step into a foreign environment such as this (compared to the bread-and-butter stuff I was doing) and discard all my preconceptions and start anew. It is probably still useful in this respect.<p>
