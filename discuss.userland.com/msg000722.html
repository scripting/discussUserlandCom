On that measure Java is kind of in the middle.  I can buy a set of APIs (as it were) from Sun, IBM, Inprise, ..., or even Microsoft.  On the open extreme I can buy a set of POSIX APIs from all kinds of people.  On the closed extreme you have things like the Mac and Windows API which only have a single source.<p>
