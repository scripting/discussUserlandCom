Ah! I suspected you might say that.<p>

Now here's my response. Maybe they should not be relying so heavily on reads of their home page?<p>

My opinion: The Internet ad business is a bubble that's ready to burst. The only ads that will survive are the ones that are interesting enough to visit on their own.<p>

The Dancing Hamsters were a huge clue for the Internet advertising industry. I wonder if they were paying attention?<p>

Anyway, I won't do anything to protect other people's ad revenues. Sorry!
