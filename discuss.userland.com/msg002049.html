I've wanted to play with it since it first came out but haven't found any. Once someone has a server speaking WDDX, it's easy to become compatible with it. <p>

BTW, it does have competition. As part of XML-RPC we have a serialization format that does the same thing. In fact, much of the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/rpc.html">spec</a> is about <struct>s and <array>s.<p>

But we won't get into a pissing contest over who came first. If, as you say, other people are deploying WDDX we'll get in the flow. It shouldn't be hard.
