The FSF is not a charity. One of the fundamental requirements for a charity (and one of the criteria that the IRS uses to determine if an organization is a charity) is that it target its benefits at those in need.

I have <a href="http://www.irs.gov/forms_pubs/pubs/p52601.htm">IRS Publication 526, Charitable Contributions: Organizations That Qualify To Receive Deductible Contributions</a> in another browser window, and it doesn't mention any requirement that a charity "target its benefits at those in need".
<blockquote>
It also makes most of its income from items unrelated to its claimed "charitable" activities (T-shirts, etc.)
</blockquote>
It's common for charitable organizations to sell stuff to raise funds.  My synagogue, for example, is having a dinner next month to honor some of its members, and charging admission to the dinner; the profits from the dinner benefit the synagogue.  (The part of the ticket price that equals the market value of the dinner is <i>not</i> tax-deductible.)  This is just like the FSF selling T-shirts to support its software development activities.

<i>Presumably, some of programmers [who contributed code to GCC] would not have done so without the "poison pill" of the GPL protecting their selfish interests -- they considered the availability of derivative works to be their compensation for their contributions.</i>

In other words, they hoped to confiscate the work of others. 
</blockquote>
They hoped that in exchange for offering their source to other developers, other developers would offer the source of derivative works to them.  If a court retroactively steps in and says that arrangement is invalid, then <i>the court</i> is confiscating the intellectual property that used to belong to the GCC developers.  How will those developers be compensated, if not by access to other developers' derivative works?
