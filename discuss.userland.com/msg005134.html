Given a specific workflow and a quite distinct concept about the information you want actually to get into your database, you can easily do a word template for a specific task -- e.g. having a doctor typing an surgery report or an medical analysis or something similar.<p>

In comparance to a free-style word document, this is rather depending on a rather well structured word document.<p>

I don't think, there will be a standard way of using word as editorial interface - otherwise word would be the best thing to use.<p>

I actually did not experiment much with the HTML export, but people are complaining that much about it, that I did not even consider using it.<p>

BTW: I looked at RFT -- it looks painful!<p>

I am checking out the MSXML.DOMDocument stuff in VisualBasic (to which I am an absolute beginner with no documentation at hand) Maybe it is far better to come up with a "exportXML" macro in Word itself?<p>

If this is going to work, the thing could maybe be used as a VBScript, which could be held in suite - Windows only.<p>
