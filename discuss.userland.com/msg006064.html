You'll encounter some bumpy spots (contrary to the recent press coverage, Linux is far from perfect), but there's lots of people who are willing to help you.<p>

<I>I don't know what all those things do. Can outsiders get into my system in any meaningful way thru those services?</I><p>

Not really. RedHat's fairly careful about security, and none of these daemons should have known security holes. But the wisest security philosophy is simple--if you're not running something, nobody can figure out how to break in through it.<p>

<I>Is this something I have to worry about right now?</I><p>

Nope. All of these services have reasonable default settings, and nothing should be wide open. Experienced Unix admins usually turn things like <B>rsh</B> off out of paranoia.<p>

For fun, pop open two terminal windows on one of your virtual desktops. Run the <B>su</B> command in each to become root (you'll need to enter your root password). In one terminal, type <B>tail -f /var/log/secure</B>. This will print out all the authentication messages for your system. In the second one, type in <B>tail -f /var/log/messages</B>. This will print out your system log and any errors from your servers.<p>

Cheers,
Eric
