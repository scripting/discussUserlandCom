Any help pointing us in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.  I have gone through the basic tutorial, but need your compass of experience.<p>

We would like to put into/keep images and text in a Filemaker Database and then either import them into Frontier and publish, or keep them in the Filemaker DB and publish.<p>

We would love to do something like NetObjects Fusion 3.0 for mac.  NetObjects will pull the image and text from a FM record and paste them into a webpage automatically going through the entire database creating a nice central table page with links directly to the individual pages it creates.<p>

How can this be done in Frontier?  <p>

I have tried to import text files exported from Filemaker without success.  What is the best type of export to use to take info from FileMaker into Frontier.<p>

Thanks so much,<p>

Jim<p>
