That was about my read.  My second thought was that content server 1.0 ca. 1997 + a little scripting could do that, without making the users write html.  I actually ran across a content server fan e-mail in my outbox today, sent to Dave in that era about a week after downloading frontier and content server. Echoes from the past.<p>

The third thought is that a perl hacker + procmail + some database could have the same thing for any unix box, written at a scripting language level (belatedly realizing that combo functionally describes frontier, but less well integrated).    <p>
