Start by removing Java and JavaScript from Netscape, move the "Always load images" option somewhere close at hand.<p>

(After noticing a negative correlation between Java/JavaScript and actual useful information, I've found leaving all the flash turned off is a great filtering aid.)<p>

Give me conditional scripting for my default colors so that I can use defaults which match my preferred ergonomics (light text, dark background) without having to suffer through "web designers" who assume that the default font color is black. Even just a "If they override one color, use this mode instead" would be handy.<p>

I used w3-mode for a while, but hadn't yet made the switch to Emacs for the rest of my editing. Now that I have maybe I'll try it again, it handles CSS style sheets and most of the other funky stuff. When I used color and font tags, I'd also use Arena to make sure my pages were readable. There are other browsers out there.
