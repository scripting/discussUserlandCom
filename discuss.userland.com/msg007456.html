1. Right -- more Windows end-users. Lots more.<p>

2. Multiple vendors competing in the Unix market push each other.<p>

3. Trained sysadmins are responsible for the systems, not untrained end-users. So patches aren't a problem, and neither are default settings.<p>

4. User permissions and other architectural roots.<p>

5. The industry treats server security far more seriously than client security. NT security is more important than Outlook and Office backdoors, and is better for the attention Microsoft gives it. Despite the number of potential 'dissatisfied customers', the money is in the servers.<p>

The Worm didn't spawn a bunch of copycats, the problem was fixed, and attention was paid to this kind of attack. (Can't afford to have the whole net go down.) On the other hand, Melissa, which has a family tree more than a couple of years long (it being very difficult to deal with macro viruses while preserving functionality and besides, who cares about the individual complaints of end users so the problem was not solved), and it was quickly turned into something harmful. During the past two years, lots more users are on the Internet with an OS that is even better integrated with it's email and application software than ever before. Which is a useful thing if you're a user or a virus.
