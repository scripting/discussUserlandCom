Unfortunately my body sinks like a rock! Big bones. So I can only get watsu from very strong people. It's still wonderful. <p>

Opportunity in Mac Publishing land? Lots of comings and goings at MacWEEK.Com. Meanwhile <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/">Macintouch</a> and <a href="http://www.macopinion.com/applesurf/">AppleSurf</a>, and a hundred Mac fan sites keep right on rolling. Maybe the Mac publishing world will be the first to migrate to the <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet">How to Make Money</a> formula, where editorial work is distributed to community members and a portal with a big brand-name ties it all together? I'd love to help it happen.<p>

Hey, here's a <a href="http://www.searchingforher.com/">Mahir-wannabe</a>. "I really do need help. I don't want to waste any more time. As you read further, you'll get to learn a great deal about me. When you are done reading everything, if you think you know of someone right now who could be a match for me, no matter where in the world she is at, then I am interested. You're going to be her agent. Do whatever you can to persuade her to give me the chance. And if you really feel strongly about the match, be persistent! Please!"<p>
