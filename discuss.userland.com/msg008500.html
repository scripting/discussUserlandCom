I just wanted to make the difference between that Python and Frontier services explicit since it hadn't been mentioned.  I was also trying to point out that the experimental service (pseudo-random nums) would be easy in Java too, given a place to host it and the proper tools.<p>

So, how does one go about finding these distributed services?  Has anyone seen anything akin to the Jini Lookup service for XML-RPC?
