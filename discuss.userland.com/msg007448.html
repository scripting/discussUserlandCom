I think you can do without writing a script here. I would use some powerful text editor to do the job, i.e. MS Word.<br>
The idea in general is to replace delimiters with pieces of XML code.
In your case there's a bit of a problem with delimiters - how to know the first colon from the second in every line to do the right substitution.<br>
In MS Word I would do the following (but I suppose it can be done in in any word processor that supports tables):
<ol>
<li>select all the text</li>
<li>convert it to table with colon as the delimiter<br>
(now we get level 1 categories in the first column of a table, level 2 - in the second, etc)</li>
<li>insert an empty column after the first one</li>
<li>select all the table</li>
<li>convert it back to text, use any delimiter, you might use the colon as well</li>
</ol>
now the first category is separated with double colon, i.e.<p>

Europe:: UK: Scotland<p>

and you can replace easily now <p>

Please contact me in case you have any difficulties with this</br></br></br>
