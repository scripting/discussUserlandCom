I spent four years on Unix, and would actually say things like "Today was a good day: I never had to leave Emacs..." and then moved project teams and started doing Mac work. One of the most frustrating and difficult things was cutting the umbilical cord to Unix, trying to take my old techniques and ways of thinking over to the Mac. Once I settled into doing things the Mac-way, I was fine. I'd successfully retread myself. <p>

But that's the point, I could make myself think both ways, but they didn't really combine very well. I'm doing the same thing now, after six years on Mac I'm on about my second year under Windows. I still have Emacs lying around for the things it does best, but I've been trying to mash my brain into VC, with okay results so far.<p>

Now, BeOS, there's a mind-twister. The UI is as simple as Mac, but hit a key and _boom_, there's a bash prompt. And most everything works like you were back on Unix. I suspect the same abilities will be available on MacOS-X. And with the Cygnus package, you can do basically the same thing under Windows, so I'm trying to do the "big merge" now without blowing up my brain. We'll see.
