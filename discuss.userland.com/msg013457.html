absolutely! if any other folks around here are like me, this is just what we've needed to be able to crank up with Frontier. The combination of on-site, in-site collaboration for the developer bits and the content, at the same time, is a great one-two punch. For those of us who want to be on both sides of the game, and play with folks who only want to contribute, but not build . . . this IS the game.<p>

Diggin'!
