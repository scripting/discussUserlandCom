My bookmark folders rarely get opened or closed once I've configures them for optimum use.  the must frequent operation for me is to schedule a calendar event, and even this is just a few times a day.  otherwise, i use the bookmarks *a lot*, the search module *a lot*, the news clipper once a day, and of course, i always have a family picture in the picture frame module.  <p>

In short, bandwidth is less of an issue once usage becomes driven by need.  Not that I don't care about bandwidth, i try to keep images to
a minimum, and of course, you can tailor the modules to just the set that are important to you.  <p>
