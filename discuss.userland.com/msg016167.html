Thank God that's <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16113">not what I said</a>. ";->"<p>

I appreciate the fact that Chris Blizzard has repeatedly stated here that Netscape is focused on shipping a browser. It makes me think that the Mozilla people get it.  I hope they are focused on getting the word out.<p>

As <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16133">taylor has pointed out</a>, one of the reasons Dreamweaver is a successful platform now is that it was first a successful HTML Editor. A successful Mozilla Browser paves the way  for a successful Mozilla Platform.<p>
