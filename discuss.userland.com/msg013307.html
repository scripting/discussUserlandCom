Re Undo, I agree that it's needed. However, we need a bit of time. I figure that the web is roughly at the same point in its development as an application deployment platform as the Apple II. Character based, with a smattering of graphics and a very limited set of UI tools for authors.<p>

It'll all bust open when we directly connect desktop apps into the server. For us, the server is Manila. We'll be publishing a full scripting interface for Manila within two weeks, so any limits in browsers can be routed around. Before anyone complains that the interface will be proprietary and involves lock-in, the answer is no, it is open.
