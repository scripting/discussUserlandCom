Would you want them to pay all of it for one Windows server, with half of the money ending up at Microsoft for the base operating system, manuals, user licenses, and the cost to you for supporting Windows? Or would you want your customers to get two Linux servers for $10,000, almost all of which you get to keep? C'mon folks, you don't need to be Alan Greenspan to figure this one out." <i>Exactly.</i><p>

<a href="http://www.deja.com/[st_cam=mydja.deja.none.mydeja_banner_ani]/rate/item.xp?CID=0&PDID=8552">Deja.Com discusses</a> Jodi Foster. Wait a minute. It gets better. Over on the Meg Ryan <a href="http://www.deja.com/[st_cam=mydja.deja.none.mydeja_banner_ani]/rate/item.xp?CID=0&PDID=375">discussion</a>, someone claims to be her gay lover, before she had the sex change operation! <p>

I am Co-Chair for the <a href="http://www9.org/w9-call-developer.html">Developer's Day</a> "Distributed Computing on the Web" track at WWW9 in Amsterdam next May. My fellow chair is Annrai O'Toole of <a href="http://www.iona.com/">Iona</a>, an expert on CORBA. I guess XML-RPC is being acknowledged. What an honor! <i>Maybe it's time to join W3C and get official?</i><p>

I'm still a newbie at this "Chairing" thing, but I understand we're in the Call for Participation stage. This means that if you have work you want to present at WWW9 that relates to Distributed Computing and the Web, now is the time to at least start thinking about making a proposal.<p>

Mr O'Toole is <a href="http://www.iona.com/info/aboutus/company/index.html">CTO at Iona</a>. He is "the visionary behind the evolution of Orbix, IONA's flagship product and the world's leading technology for Making Software Work Together."</img></img>
