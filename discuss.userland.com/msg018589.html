At 8pm EST, 7/13/2000 we released a new design for the Dartmouth College external web site, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/">http://www.dartmouth.edu/</a>.<p>

The site is built and scripted with Frontier 6.2 (not Manila, yet, because I needed to designate multiple templates), including a web-based system for managing/maintaining the three link sections on the main home page (still under development ;). See the <b>about this site</b> link in the page footer.<p>

I,  we, would be interested in any comments people might have. As well any questions about how I did/am doing the site.<p>

Thanks for listening...<p>
