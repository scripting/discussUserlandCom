Now tell me where I'd go to buy that song?</i><p>

As far as I can remember, that particulr recording of "I Saw Her Standing There" was found as the b-side of the "Philadelphia Freedom" single that Elton released in 1975.<p>

So, to get that recording, you'd probably have to scour used record shops for a version that was in decent shape, and then probably pay a premium because it's a rarity.<p>

I wish someone would digitize these things and make sure that they never die.  There's this market build on pure supply and demand that creates ridiculously high prices (have you priced a copy of the "butcher baby" Beatles album lately?) for artifacts of the music industry.  Now, the artifacts may be rare, but there's no reason that the music has to be.<p>

Unlike times past, where the only way to record music was on paper, we have the opportunity to make the music last forever.  So why aren't we?<p>
