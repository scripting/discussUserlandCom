Good policy! ;-) Customers are smart, right?<p>

<I>A few years ago I thought our server story would be finished with NT, today it's not true. For a lot of people, more and more, you don't really have a server story until you're running on Linux.</I><p>

Ah, well. Things change. I'm glad we have WINE--it allows Win32 developers to become Linux developers without pitching their all their code and starting from scratch.<p>

If your customers say you should have a Linux story, we want it to be a fun and easy story for you to tell.<p>

Cheers,
Eric
