In the case of spam, finger, and windows, the original meanings came from outside of the computer industry, which reduces the possibility of confusion. <p><p>

"Weblog" is an overload of a term from *within* the computer/net industry, which creates the potential for confusion.<p><p>

IMHO "log" doesn't seem very accurate; it seems like more of a digest than a log, since there's often a little text summarizing what the link is about.<p><p>

"Webdigest" seems like a better description.<p><p>
