What is the OSS "methodology"?  I didn't know that there was one?  As a Microsoft employee, I can also attest that many of us in Redmond have developed for UNIX, open source, and contributed to "communal" programming efforts in our lives previous (and sometimes during) Microsoft.  I would venture that Microsoft has a higher density of OSS-literate people than most other IT organizations.  Do you suppose we forget everything we know when we clip on the Microsoft badge? :-)
