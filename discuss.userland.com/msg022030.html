He's certainly a businessperson, a restauranteur, but he's also a cook and a teacher. It's generally assumed in the software business that you need a CEO who knows little about the product and users to run your company. I've always thought this was wrong. Software is more like a restaurant. Puck serves hamburgers at Spago in Orlando (kids like them). And macaroni and cheese. But it's Puck-style, not mass-produced, with fresh ingredients and weird spices. <i>Weird is good.</i><br><br><a href="http://www.sbrowning.com/vintage/index.php3?p=3">Vintage computer ads</a>. <i>A lost art.</i><br><br><a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap001127.html">Earth at Night</a>. <i>Visible global warming?</i><br><br>
