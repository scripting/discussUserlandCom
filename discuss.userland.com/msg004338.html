Actually, I don't know what is the formal name of it, but whenever I talked to other web people, they know what I meant.<p>

When I said "root-based url", I meant a url specifying from the root down to the file, w/o the domain name. So, <p>

	<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/htmlInterfaces/discussionGroup/msgReader">http://discuss.userland.com/htmlInterfaces/discussionGroup/msgReader</a>$<p>

will become<p>

	/htmlInterfaces/discussionGroup/msgReader$<p>


As far as I know, it wouldn't make any difference as long as the url come from the same domain.<p>

<p>

<I>Also, could you visit the Who Are You? page and fill in your name. It would make your messages friendlier and more personal.</I><p>

Done.
