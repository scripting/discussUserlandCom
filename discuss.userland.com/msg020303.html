that much. Granted, it makes it easier for them to track down
their content and put a stop to uses they don't like, but...
<br><br>
The more they regulate the use of their content, the less it
is worth to me. And if they were seriously thinking about the
economic issues they'd realize that things like my.mp3.com
and Napster influence the marginal consumer (which is what
is directly connected to the price they can charge). That is, it
might tip me over from not-buying to buying if I know that once
I've bought a CD I can to listen to it anywhere I have an Internet
connection and speakers. And, if I'm not sure if I want to buy
a CD, sampling a few of the tracks on Napster will make it more
likely I'm satisfied with the CD purchases I do make, increasing
the price I am willing to pay for those CDs.

Watermarks are much better for them than audio fingerprinting 
because it opens up the possibility of price discrimination:
charging people who value the music a great deal (so want to 
listen to it in the car, keep a copy on their computer, etc.)
more and people who just want to listen to it once in a while
less. Unfortunately for them, the way I understand it, the same
kind of research that leads to audio fingerprinting (figuring out the
essential parts of an audio signal that will not change as 
you recode it) is also the research that teaches people how
to strip watermarks.
