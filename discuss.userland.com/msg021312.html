UserLand participated, along with 44 companies in defining the charter for this working group. <br><br>	The process leading to the XML Protocol activity at the W3C was confidential. There came a point in the discussion where each participating company had to express their opinion re the formation of the working group. That came on August 18. I can only share my own opinion with you. This is what I <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$938">said</a>.<br><br>	There are a lot of conclusions to draw today and probably in the coming weeks. For the next 1.5 years the W3C will be working in this area. In the meantime, we have two widely-deployed specifications for XML-based distributed computing, XML-RPC and SOAP. I have no doubt that this technology is relevant, and the W3C charter explains why.<br><br>	<i>The Web can grow significantly in power and scope if it is extended to support communication between applications, from one program to another. The purpose of this Working Group is to create a simple foundation to support the needs of such communicating applications.</i><br><br>	That gets a 100-percent right on from Dave. As the process continues, I've come to appreciate the way the W3C works and am more and more impressed with the mind of TBL. <br><br>	<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21314">William Crimm expresses</a> confusion about the charter of the working group, and I shed <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21316">whatever light</a> I can.
