Now, in your position, even this might be a good thing, why should you care what bits appear on all the desktops? Maybe I shouldn't care either.  I just don't think the Mac is a very open platform for software developers. Or it's too subject to the whims of the platform vendor. Maybe you could say the same thing about Frontier. Who knows. <p>

Very recently you said you were happy to be on both platforms because that meant Microsoft didn't own you, and neither did Apple.<p>

I don't know if you've considered this before, but part of my reason for using Frontier is because:<p>

1) You're not Microsoft or Apple.  I don't want either of them to control me either, any more than they already do.<p>

2) The ODB is very open, so if you want to break something, I can probably fix it.  That's good protection for me and all your customers.<p>

I think we're seeing Apple become more open.  Licensing OpenGL for the MacOS is a step in the right direction.  It's a lot safer to code for OpenGL than QuickDraw 3D which Apple could kill at any time.<p>

Let's get our jobs done. I won't worry too much about the Mac, and hope for the best. <p>

Something else to consider is that Apple's obviously got the weaker hand right now, and if Apple loses too much influence, your "No-one owns me cause I'm cross-platform" protection is kaput.  So, from where I'm sitting it seems to me it's in your interest to have balance of power... stay balanced.<p>

To me, that means supporting Apple's zigs and zags where appropriate -- if they get MacOS X right, you won't have to rely on NT for your customers who want to run scalable Frontier servers... so for example,  a carbon compatible Frontier that screams like a banshee on OS X helps you keep that balance steady in your sphere of influence.<p>

The little things make a difference... it's chaos theory.<p>

Don't assume Apple can keep the balance of power steady all by themselves...  We've seen the result of that before. ;-)<p>
