I don't want anyone else to have to work this one out!<p>

I was working in CodeWarrior and making extensive use of the debugger . If you get an error in the debugger that says "unmapped memory exception" you might think you could quit out and get back to work. Don't be fooled! Reboot your Mac, you've crashed the Memory Manager. Once I figured this out I turned 5 hours of frustration into one line of code. Now it works.<p>
