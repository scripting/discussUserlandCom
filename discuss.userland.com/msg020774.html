It's an IBM keyboard from
1995 or so.  Adjustable split, adjustable height at front and back
courtesy of four legs with screws in them.  No numeric keypad, two
sets of inverted-T cursor keys that abut the bottom left and right
corners of the keyboard (so you can hit cmd-arrows with either hand),
and the page up/down/etc keys are at the top right.  Has a split
spacebar, where you can set one side of it to be a delete key.  Nice
click-y action.  After trying a number of special weird keyboards to
alleviate my hand pain, including chording keyboards, various
natural/split keyboards, and the Kinesis recessed keyboard, I found
this one to be the best.  And it ends up using less space than a
regular keyboard, so I can put my trackball on the keyboard area of my
desk.<p>

No photo (I'm not even using a graphical Web browser at the moment,
I'm writing this in XEmacs launched from w3m :-) but I'll see if I can
dig one up.<p>

Only problem with it is was that the control key is tiny, but I
changed control and caps lock, and all is well.<p>
