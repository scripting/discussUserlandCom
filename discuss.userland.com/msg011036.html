This discussion has got me thinking, though, about possible <b>good</b> uses of a local proxy server.<p>

I've been trying to figure out how to put together a good, cross-browser, flexible, unintrusive bookmarking system within Frontier.  I'm sick of going from machine to machine and not having my bookmarks.  What I want is the ability to just surf the web, and when I like a site, bookmark it in much the same way that the browsers let me now.  It just hit me that a Frontier local proxy would let me do <i>exactly that</i>.<p>

Imagine this proxy, just grabbing the page that you want and then throwing it into a window with a small sliver of the top of the normal window missing.  Instead of containing the web page, this small sliver would have my new favorites system controls.  There would be a URL text input area, an "add to your favorites" button, a pulldown menu with your current favorites, and so on.  That would be SO COOL, and if the proxy were running on an internet-accessible machine, I could use it from any machine that I use.<p>

Wow... now I just need time to develop this...<p>
