Otherwise I think it requires a nazi-like facilitator to keep making assumptions explicit and challengeable.<p>

So I think you essentially have a review/consensus meeting where you re-summarize as a group everything that's been covered by posted forum discussions.<p>

You start out by building the agenda which summarizes all the points that have been covered (I guess this should just be a tweaked verion of the plan outline that was the output of the previous meeting). Then, during the meeting, you start hanging detail off those nodes, getting buy-in at each step.<p>

A couple tools/techniques that might be helpful:
<ul>
<li> those systems that let one person "drive" the browser of other people. This way you could refer to a Discussion entry and take everyone there at the same time, rather than making a URL available via the outline and waiting for everone to click on it
<li> encouraging people to write new Subject lines for each entry, rather than just having a Re: of the previous. I might go so far as to (a) leave the add-response Subject field blank, and make it required.
</ul>
Regardless of the tools, a lot of people will believe this process is a horrible waste of time, since you're "re-hashing" what's already been done. But I don't see (yet) an alternative, even with blue-sky maybe-they'll-invent-it-in-20-years technology.</li></li>
