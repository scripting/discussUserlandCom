Look for a block with a comment above it:<p>

"Make sure the object is checked out by this user, if the object already exists."<p>

Comment out the line "if defined (adrObject^)" to comment-out that entire block.<p>

Now you can check in objects you haven't checked out.<p>

There's a similar change you can make to the sendToServer rpc handler.<p>

Of course -- be sure to note which changes you make, in case we update this code and your changes are over-written.
