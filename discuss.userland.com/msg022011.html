I was not happy. The schmoozing has already begun. Shared a cab with Alan and Sue Cooper. Brent has arrived too. Next we're going to dinner. I have a fast net connection in my room, only $10 per day. Worth it. I love you all, take care, see you tomorrow.<br><br><b>Dreaming<a name="dreaming">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/12/06#dreaming" title="Permanent link to 'Dreaming' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Strange dream last night. Walking at night on the streets in NYC, end up somehow in a dark empty poor neighborhood with a fat wallet. A young child is with me, not an innocent child, a hardened city-wise kid, who knows it isn't good. I know it too. Walk down a street, hit a fence. Can't get through. Go another way, can't get through. "We're going to get killed," I think. I hear voices. The kid and I crouch behind a car. Men dressed as gang members, talking loudly arrive, standing just on the other side of the car. They discover us. I stand up. Now what? I think (as I imagine the horrors that are about to happen to me and the kid). I offer the leader a cigarette. He takes it, empties the tobacco into a rolling paper, mixes in some hash, and passes it around. We laugh. They explain that they set their neighborhood up this way so the bad guys would stay out. What a relief. Did my mind prepare the whole story for me this way? How many levels of dreaming was I doing?<br><br>	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/06/opinion/06DOWD.html">Maureen Dowd</a>: "It's sad to picture Al Gore, his brain all caked, locked up in his spooky vice-presidential mansion frantically crunching the numbers and e-mailing on his Blackberry and laptops and speed-dialing Tallahassee."<br><br>	<i>Maybe Gore should run a weblog?</i><br><br><b>Yes they're hot<a name="yesTheyreHot">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/12/06#yesTheyreHot" title="Permanent link to 'Yes they're hot' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I've become friends with James Hong, the brilliant young founder of <a href="http://www.amihotornot.com/">AmIHotOrNot</a>. They're running at 10 million hits per day now. It's a unique Web community because it's gender balanced, equal numbers of men and women.  A SOAP app lurking behind a browser interface. James conceived it that way. "What would make the most compelling SOAP app?" That's the derivation of AmIHotOrNot. It's no accident James and his brother started <a href="http://www.xmethods.com/">XMethods.Com</a>, a registration point for SOAP services. Reminder to ask James to include the ManilaRPC <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/manilaRpc">interface</a> in his database.<br><br><b>Truckin<a name="truckin">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/12/06#truckin" title="Permanent link to 'Truckin' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Finally for today, let me be the first to wish you a happy 2001 Space Odyssey New Year.
