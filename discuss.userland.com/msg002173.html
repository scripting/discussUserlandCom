This looks excellent, except for the date-time handling bit. You should optionally add timezone information to date-time values. When nodes on the net interoperate they can be in very different timezones. W/o tz info date-time processing can become a real mess. However, there are cases when you wouldn't want to send the tz info 'cos you want to work in server time.<p>

Brent, thanks for putting in the work!<p>
