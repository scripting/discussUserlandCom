This allows you to put 302 Found right in the file and allows us to redirect whole folders of files easily without having to fart around with plug-ins or SSIs or whatever. The docs for this feature can be found on the StarNine <a href="http://www.starnine.com/webstar/docs/ws4manual.3b.html#30887">website</a>.<p>

<b>How to do in IIS?</b><p>

We now have an IIS server that we want to move stuff off of, but want to place redirect files in place of the files we've moved. I want a simple way to do it, as described above. Does anyone know if or how this works in Microsoft IIS?
