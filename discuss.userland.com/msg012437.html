For starters, the anecdotal evidence that when I saw the URL on a mailing list this morning, I thought the four companies were working together on a project (or someone was parodying them). Even after seeing the site, I didn't think it was an unsanctioned project until you mentioned it in a discussion message.<p>

It ain't much, admittedly, but how many people confused DaveNet and DaveNetics before you were willing to rush to the battlements last week? <p>

The bigger issue with me, though, is that SalonHerringWiredFool.Com fully repurposes syndicated content under a name that seems likely to redirect traffic away from the content producers involved.
