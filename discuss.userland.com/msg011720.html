Guess I can't use the mouse on the right side of the computer. (Wanna talk foolish? how about adaptec's 8" scsi dongles for it's PCMCIA card. Can't move the computer when using scsi)<p>

I remember reading those quotes from some mac rumours board.
Two simple solutions
 1) External USB mike.
 2) Trackpad. <p>

1) Voice Log-in is a golly gee whiz feature for MS to implement in window 98/2001. It's a nice security feature, but it's not as important as the mutliuser feature. Apple probably could not get a quality mike into the iBook at it's price point, or voice log-in was not a feature when the iBook specs were developed (ibook with it's agp may be a bit late). And, if you want to wait another eight weeks, I'm sure you can get an iBook with MacOS9 (eight weeks: two weeks to implemet at the factory, and 6 weeks by ship)<p>

2) Buy a pointing device with a long usb cable, or a usb extension cable. Unlike the rumors site, you are not just going to grab the mouse off the iMac and say it does not reach. An iMac without a mouse is not usable, so you need to purchase on to tote around (unless you don't share the comptuer with anyone else).<p>


An let's talk cool, ignored feature that's often ignored. Apple's trackpad implements drag, tap, and double-tap. A one button mouse does have it's advantages. If they'd just implement context menus with the click hold, instead of control click, no one would want a two button mouse.<p>
