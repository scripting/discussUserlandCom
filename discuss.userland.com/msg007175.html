You can use it to send and receive (8-bit) binary objects. They will be base64-encoded and enclosed within a base64 tag.<p>

Encoding Empty and Null as empty strings makes sense to me.<p>

<i>	Long integer</i><p>

Is a "Long integer" an 8-byte integer in VB?<p>

<i>Single-precision floating-point number</i><p>

You should use <double> here -- <int> can't represent floating-point numbers like e.g. 3.141<p>

<i>	Currency</i><p>

Use <double> for the same reasons as the previous item.<p>

<i>	Automation object</i><p>

Not sure what this is...?<p>

<i>	Variant</i><p>

This must be the VB-equivalent of what is known as a union in C. It's a variable that can contain objects of different types at different times. I am not sure how to encode these though.<p>

<i>data-access object</i><p>

Again, not sure what this is...?<p>

<i>	Byte</i><p>

I think I'd go with <int> here.
