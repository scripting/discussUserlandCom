I was wondering about that myself, whether this might have been a low point.  But I have a couple reasons to think differently.  First, I saw a lot of communications meetings at Apple, and a panel looking as dismal as this happened very rarely.  I remember a lot of continuous eyes-up at Apple. Perhaps MS rarely has large internal communications meetings, and these folks have little idea how bad this looks.<p>

My second reason for dismissing an out-of-context interpretation is the following New Yorker article my father sent me in June:
<a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2000_05_29_a_interview.htm">http://www.gladwell.com/2000_05_29_a_interview.htm</a><p>

However, part of the point of this article is that folks tend to overlook the significance of context.  So I'm really sending mixed messages here.  Maybe the moral of the story is that you can judge what is happening in this picture, but it's hard to judge what this means in some other context inside Microsoft at other times.  However, the following excerpt is interesting, and I hope it convinces folks here to read the entire article:<p>

Gladwell.com: <i>The observers, presented with a ten-second silent
video clip, had no difficulty rating the teachers on a fifteen-
item checklist of personality traits. In fact, when Ambady cut the
clips back to five seconds, the ratings were the same. They were
even the same when she showed her raters just two seconds of
videotape. That sounds unbelievable unless you actually watch
Ambady's teacher clips, as I did, and realize that the eight
seconds that distinguish the longest clips from the shortest are
superfluous: anything beyond the first flash of insight is
unnecessary.</i>
