"The crash in Internet stocks and the uncertain economy have venture capitalists sailing against the wind in choppy seas. Most claim they are not worried. But the truth of the matter is that for the past three years VCs have invested for the short term."<br><br>Paul Andrews: <a href="http://www.unionrecord.com/biz/display.php?ID=1785">Was 'free' such a good idea?</a><br><br><a href="http://jake.editthispage.com/2001/01/05">Jake Savin</a>: "Then a couple of days later, while doing a search for some totally unrelated information using Google, I had an epiphany - maybe my whole site is still cached on Google's servers! Sure enough, doing an advanced search for the word Jacob on the domain jspace.org, I found all of my copy! Google saved my ass!"<br><br>Dylan Tweney: <a href="http://www.ecompany.com/articles/web/0,1653,9075,00.html">Infrastructure is big in 2001</a>. "If you've got a website, chances are you'll be spending significantly more this year than you did last year to beef up your site's capacity to handle traffic, customers, and content. Sites that don't invest in these improvements will find themselves falling behind, as the number of Web users mushrooms and puts a heavier strain on their servers."<br><br>WSJ: <a href="http://public.wsj.com/sn/y/SB978651615824742861.html">Apple seeks new role of maker of Killer Apps</a>.<br><br>Yesterday I added a new <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001">page</a> to the DaveNet site called 2001. I looked down the list of years. 1994. 1995. 1996. 1997. 1998. 1999. 2000. 2001. In three years it will be the tenth anniversary of DaveNet. Where did the time go?<br><br><a href="http://inessential.com/2001/01/05.html">Brent</a>: "When I freakin' double-click on a freakin' word, it should not freakin' select the freakin' space after the freakin' word, it should just freakin' select the freakin' word it-freakin'-self." <i>Agreed.</i><br><br><b>Mood gorning!<a name="moodGorning">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/05#moodGorning" title="Permanent link to 'Mood gorning!' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Mood gorning!' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	Good morning! Rise and shine. Strrrrrrrrrrrrrretch. Let's have a great day today. <br><br>	Tons of email. As usual some of it is accusatory. You did this! You lied about that! You stole my idea! What you're doing is really Push! Oy yoy yoy, as my father used to say. (BTW, we <i>are</i> doing Push, but that's not all we're doing.)<br><br>	In any case Desktop Websites they are. In the model we're actively developing now the URLs in your browser go to a bit of software running on your machine. It looks like a website. It totally is a website. It's running on your desktop. So if that isn't a Desktop Website my name is Pope John Paul. ";->"<br><br>	"the pope"<br><br>
