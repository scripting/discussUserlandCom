Netcenter should be able to do most of RSS using Dublin Core [<a href="http://purl.org/dc/">http://purl.org/dc/</a>]. DC represents a consensually built standard for
simple discovery-oriented description of 'document like' objects; it 
is vendor neutral and has ties to bibliographic standards such as MARC widely used in the Library world. Mozilla.org should be able to do
most of client-side sitemaps using Dublin Core. Dublin Core has adopted RDF's data model (though is experimenting with simpler syntaxes); this means that any application that buys into RDF can use DC properties for simple document-like description, mixed in with other properties (ratings etc) which may be more proprietary or experimental.<p>

In this sense, the RDF data model creates a safe marketplace for
competing vocabularies, since there's a principled way to manage a mix-in of independently defined terms; raw XML doesn't give you this.<p>

Consequently, if Netcentre use raw XML, they'll have to reinvent a Dublin Core like property set. Which is probably not a good use of their time.<p>
