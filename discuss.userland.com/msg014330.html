And I noticed that uninstalling IE5.5 was as rough for me as it was for you Dave. I uninstalled IE 5.5, then reinstalled IE 5.01, but my home machine has never been the same way since. I'm having memory leaks in IE now that I never had before, which results in IE crashing after about 15 minutes of use.
