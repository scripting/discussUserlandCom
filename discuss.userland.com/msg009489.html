this is absolutely _NOT_ the case. reporter's are obscenely aggressive about protecting the identity of their sources. if there is a singular, bedrock principle in journalism, this is it.<p>

i have never, ever witnessed an editorial outlet not respect a source's request to remain anonymous.<p>

this is a terrible precedent for scripting news and davenet.
