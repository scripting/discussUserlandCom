 agree with you. you can't tell a reporter that it was off the record after you said it. or what's the other
                 saying, "the cat's out of the bag"....<p>

                 confidentiality agreements require at least two!

I think that is a typical illustration of the difference between european journalism and american journalism. For me, The Walter Crosby's email was really clear. When I have finished to read it and saw the advertisement, I was very disappointed why it was published. The first feeling, I have had it was that Dave Winner have published the mail without reading it completly.<p>

You need to respect the private life of people. If he don't want to appear, he must have reason for that.<p>

Yours answers guys leave me... in a strange way.
