Can you actually select text to do copy/paste?  What will your printing story be?  Will you be able to "view source..."?  Can you do a "Find on page"?<p>

These are things that you take for granted that you will be giving up for a little bit of anti-aliased text.  Flash does so much more, but integrating that into the system will be much harder -- look at how difficult it is to seamlessly add a little dynamic HTML content.<p>

On top of that, MSIE in Windows already has anti-aliased text.  This is only above a certain size.  I remember hearing usability talks that under certain point sizes the text actually gets less readable and appears blurry.  It is actually the font author that specifies this in a table in the TTF (<a href="http://www.truetype.demon.co.uk/ttalias.htm">http://www.truetype.demon.co.uk/ttalias.htm</a>). It sounds like what you really want is ClearType (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/</a>).<p>

Flash is cool, but it looks like you might loose more than you gain in this situation.
