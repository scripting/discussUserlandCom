I have 2 questions.  The first is:  I can not find a listing for error messages anywhere.  Anyone know where I can find one?<p>

The second is a bit more technical.  I am coming into an organization where pre-existing web server was a mac OS 7.x and they were running Frontier 4 and Webstar 2.0.1.  Apparently the OS crashed, and they bought a new G3 machine, but loaded Frontier 4 and webstar back onto the machine.  Now when the CGI scripts are run, I get an error that Frontier couldn't process the request because: Mac OS error: -116.  Anyone have any ideas?  Is this an OS issue like I think?  Or is there an easy fix that I don't know about?  Thanks so much!<p>
