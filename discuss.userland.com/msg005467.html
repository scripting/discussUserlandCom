A YB version would run under Win 95/98/NT and MacOS X/OS X Server. We are still a year away from when this can be realized but you can swap the System 7 people out and get the Mac OS X/OS X server people in exchange. The only way to get the Darwin people appears to be a port to YB which would be more ambitious but would give you a common Mac OS X/OS X Server/Win 95-98-NT code base.<p>

Lots of options, too early really to decide though...
