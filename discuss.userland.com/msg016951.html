"Viruses are really an industry-wide issue," said Scott Culp, program manager for Microsoft's security response center. "They can be written for any platform. They can be written to use a variety of e-mail clients. <p>

"In this case the virus author chose to target Outlook probably because it gave him better reach," he said. "There isn't a security vulnerability in Outlook involved in this at all," Culp said.</i><p>

What a load of crap.<p>

This is very simple, really. When you open an attachment, the VB code in it runs with full privileges on your computer. To call this <i>not a security vulnerability in Outlook</i> takes the most serious self delusion possible.<p>

Security is a contraint. People will be people and therefore are unlikely to place constraints on themselves, voluntarily. Asking people to only execute signed (<i>and signed by trusted parties</i>, you forgot to mention) attachments is a constraint noone will place on themselves unless they've been burned once or twice.<p>

In other words, the design is seriously flawed. Instead of relying on users to "do the right thing", MS is responsible for designing a working security framework.<p>

The argument that this is an industry-wide issue is also disingenious. Outlook <i>is</i> the industry, all of it. Or at least its all of the <i>vulnerable</i> part of the industry. Have you heard about disasters such as this <b>ILOVEU</b> virus spreading through Netscape mail? No? Why not? Maybe because that is immune to such juvenile attacks?
