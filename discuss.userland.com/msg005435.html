Ken>Which version of Frontier::RPC?  0.04 fixed some major problems, 
Ken>0.05 a couple of minor ones.  I've got them uploaded to CPAN now <p>


SB>I was using 0.04 but have since upgraded to 0.05. Same symptoms. To recap:
<synopsis> frontier could talk to frontier via RPC, Frontier::RPC perl clients could talkd to Frontier::RPC perl daemons. Perl clients could talk to Frontier servers but 'weren't hearing anything' [no results returned in sample clients...]</synopsis>
