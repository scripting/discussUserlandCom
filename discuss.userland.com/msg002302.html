Apache speaks HTTP just fine, but the question is, what kind of procedures do you want to export via XML-RPC?  The Apache server API?  Scripts running in mod_perl and other embedded scripting languages?  Shell scripts?  :)<p>

I think this is mostly an issue on the side of those procedures.  Writing a module that allows other modules to register XML-RPC procedure names is likely to be rather easy, I think.<p>

But then, I haven't modified any of the Apache code myself.
