I personally paid for BBEdit several years ago when I had a Mac on my desk.(Gotta love the student rates)<p>

I personally still pine for BBEdit, because it is the "All-High God-like Text Processing Juggernaut!"  Nothing on Unix, Windows, or even other Mac editors even comes close.  <p>

EMacs didn't kill anything.  Go over to Stallman's house a drive a stake through his heart, perhaps that will exorcise the demons that seem to haunt you.  Either that or just deal with it.
