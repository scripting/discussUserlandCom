Anticipate less than 50 transactions/day.<p>

Secure server will need to be included.  Considering secure IIS server operating on SSL port passing info to otherwise dynamic rendered F6 site. (G3 Mac server/WebSTAR SSL also available and would be considered if this would be "easier" to implement.) <p>

Thanks...
