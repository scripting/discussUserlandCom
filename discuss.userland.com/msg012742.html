basically, since the availability of the my.userland.com syndication 
feed, i've stopped "surfing" the net and instead have the net come 
to me, on my terms.  I have all of the sites, all of the searches, and
god knows a whole lot of tech news and opinions all in one place, available whenever i want, even long after the headlines are gone from the original site.<p>

same goes for my replay tv.  turns traditional tv on its ear.  networks turn into content providers, cable comanies turn into content feeds, and the replay is a crude, but quite useful user
interface on top of my custom tv log. what i want, when i want it.<p>

can you say convergence? ;-)<p>
