What I would really like to see is an explicit list of OS level features and browser features required to implement the Userland vision. That way we could evaluate alternatives and petition our favorite OS and browser vendors (or start relevant open-source projects where appropriate). After all, Apple, BeOS, Linux, Opera, iCab and Mozilla etc. might simply not be aware of what feature sets will let them play in this playground. I know I don't :)
