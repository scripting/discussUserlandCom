That semaphore was a very recent addition. For right now, you can cure the problem by quitting and relaunching Frontier which releases all semaphores. I bet you have a macro error in the page ==> macro errors are <a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/logbrowser/htmlMacroErrors">logged</a> to the log guest db.<p>

BTW, the best way to debug a mainResponder request is to open mainResponder.respond and click on the Run button. A dialog will open asking for the URL. Paste it in. Then when the script errors, you'll get a standard Error Info window and if you click on the Go To button you'll get a call stack so you can quickly find out where the error is. I use this all the time, saves a lot of head-scratching on where things went wrong.<p>

This is really exciting that people are starting to ask deep questions about mainResponder. I look forward to learning *a lot* from you guys!
