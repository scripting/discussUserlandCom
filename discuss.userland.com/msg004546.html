Dave, these are exciting developments. Things are moving incredibly fast in multiple directions in Frontier Land. I'm not sold on RSS. Your own <scriptingnews> syndication format seems much more useful. I really hope that you are able to stick with the <scriptingnews> format for newssearch.userland.com. My selfish motivation is that I would much prefer to use the <scriptingnews> format for a vertical JIT search engine in my own field of medical education.<p>

What a day!  We need some music. Any suggestions?
