I have some utility and gaming stuff on a IIvx (!). I was hoping 6.2 would work on that machine (it's still running 4.2.3). I haven't tried to install 6.2 on it yet, though. I was going to do that this weekend, but I had to track down a network problem instead (dratted cables!).<p>

'Course, if I can get the network extended to the basement, it'll be a moot point; all I'll need on the IIvx is a browser.<p>
