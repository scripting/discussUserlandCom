See Jeff Veen's complaint about poorly targeted ads:<br>
<a href="http://www.hotwired.com/webmonkey/99/25/index0a.html?tw=frontdoor">http://www.hotwired.com/webmonkey/99/25/index0a.html?tw=frontdoor</a><p>

But perhaps it's more than that.  If websites can personalize and get more sophisticated, why can't ads and campaigns?  Why can't an ad agency distribute a different ad depending on the site and page it's placed on?  Why do ads have to fit into a standard box?<p>

Isn't it partly because they're static (albeit animated) images?  If the client or server does an XML-RPC call to an ad agency's XML-RPC server, might you have the potential for more sophisticated dynamic layout that fits the design of a particular page (or even a particular user), rather than an ignorable standard-sized chunk at the top?  You might need an XML dtd or something?<p>

Just thinking out loud<p>
