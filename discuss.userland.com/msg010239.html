However, some of the recent (highly improved, for the months it was active) functionality is totally lost from my perspective right now - maybe you're well aware, but... if not, I <b>really</b> miss the navigational structure that was on the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">Frontier site</a> for quite a while.  I can't seem to locate the HowTo's no matter how hard I search and browse.  The top-level organization was top-notch!  (it's been different for a couple weeks?)<p>

It sounds like you're shooting for a more encompassing and organized site, just my feedback-bits.<p>
