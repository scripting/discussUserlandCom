I also think I'm approching it from a different angle.  When I see Apple (the corporation) disenguage from the world around it, I ask if they are choosing irrelevance.</p>
<p>There are lots of points along the trail that I take as evidence for that choice.  One of the big ones was discarding cross-platform development tools (a "Yellow Box" runtime for Windows).  Another is the way Apple approaches open source projects that might support their standards 
(<a href="http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=606140921">link</a>).</p>
<p>Am I as a UNIX developer willing to play with Apple?  Sure, but I get the feeling they are in their backyard, and no one is answering the bell.</p>
