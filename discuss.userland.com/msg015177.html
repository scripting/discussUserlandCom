<a href="http://www.archinter.com/interlog/">arch>inter.LOG</a>: "I continue to keep a weblog because it creates content and contributes to the development of a community."<p>

Two essays, one web. Different tools, same world. <p>

BTW, I never would have found inter.LOG if it weren't for Weblogs.Com.<p>

I think one of the next steps for Weblogs.Com is to allow people to create their own renderings of the data it contains. It doesn't have to be UserLand-branded. Why should this resource be tilted to one brand of Weblog? <i>It shouldn't.</i><p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$15197">Karl Martino</a>: "Here in ManilaLand, there are multiple places for people to go for guidance and recognition. Scripting News being the largest, but there are others like Carpe Diem that consistently point me in cool directions as well."<p>

That's enough to get it on the hotlist, so tomorrow it will be watching them watch us watching them watching us watching them. <i>You get the idea.</i><p>

I just cleaned up the <a href="http://glossary.userland.com/">global shortcuts</a> site, these are the shortcuts that work on all UserLand-hosted sites. <p>

One sure way to get me to <a href="http://www.evolt.org/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=781&catid=25">point</a> to a site is to whine about me, using an aesthetically pleasing template. It's true, there are security concerns with HTML email. It's also true that I was excited by the power I had gotten. <p>
