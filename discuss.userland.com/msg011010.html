Since you asked. ;-><p>

As I understand it, the purpose of the M-POST dance is to allow system managers to configure their firewalls to allow or disallow these calls.<p>

There were a lot of heated arguments on this. I didn't put up a big fight on this because XML-RPC does what I want it to do, it just uses POST, and I think there's enough info in the header to allow a firewall to filter them in a reasonable way, if they want to.<p>

I see all flavors of XML-RPC as simple formalizations of POSTs. Nothing more or less controversial.<p>

However, I see this as a support headache in the making. But they did make it a dance, and there are some circumstances when the conversation happens thru POST, this setup allows the firewall to get in the loop, but doesn't stop the conversation if the firewall doesn't know from M-POST.<p>

At least that's my understanding of how it's supposed to work. Am I confused? Yes I am.
