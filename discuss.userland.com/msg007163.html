If you want to understand the practical reality of "Open Source", read the Cathedral.  Mr. Raymond's essay is written from the perspective of someone right down there in the heart of the glowing furnace.  A true practitioner of the art, Mr. Raymond carries his shovel and stokes the fire.<p>

Mr. Stephenson's essay is written as if he were Merlin, traveling backward through time able to understand a "new" technology as the cultural artifact it has already become in the "future". In his essay, Mr. Stephenson's gaze penetrates great spans of time piecing together the seemingly incongruous movements and machinations that converge in one culture's moment to reflect and record it's belief system.  It's technology.<p>
