OK, here's a challenge. Post the URL of your bank statement in a reply to this message. Or your brokerage account.<p>

If you are reluctant to do so, then you understand why the banks don't want deep links into their system passed around. Even the <i>appearance</i> of lack of security is a problem for them. I totally understand this. I wouldn't want the URLs of my accounts passed around, no matter how secure the system is.
