Think about how Odigo can be used.  Customer service, education, health care.  Beyond that, how would you like to know what classical music sites are most popular with people between the ages of 26-45, who live in Northern California?  And talk with them in real time!<p>

Can't do that with ICQ.  And try to find those results on Hotbot.  Odigo is the next step in instant messaging.<p>
