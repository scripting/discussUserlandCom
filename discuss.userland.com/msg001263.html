There is this girl at your work and you know that she wants to have sex with you and one day you end up doing it. You didn't commit any crime but people start to acuse you of lots of crimes (most sex related) just because they want to put you down, and then they put you in a trial and ask if you had sex with this girl.<p>

Your wife is there, what will you say?<p>

Clinton didn't lie about the inflation, didn't lie about the Iraq Crisis, didn't lie about anything that have anything to do with your country. He only lied when people put him against the wall on matters of his own personal interest, he lied about things that could ruin his marriage, about things that the politians had nothing to do, I don't think that what he's done comes even close to an impeachable offense.<p>
