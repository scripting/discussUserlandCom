The thing I don't get is, what is Conxion thinking?  From what I can see they're a pretty big outfit, right?<p>

They've got all this marketing hype about 99.999 percent uptime.  I can't imagine that it would hurt them to apologize for the outages and throw some free time on the old Userland account.<p>

They must not realize that Userland has a voice and people are listening.  In the past, before this incident, I considered Conxion to be a pretty good ISP.  I will now think twice about using Conxion as an ISP and will recommend that others not use their services.
