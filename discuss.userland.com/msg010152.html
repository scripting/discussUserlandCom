does userland not think we should be part of the flow here? it seems like this would be trivial to fix, esp. considering that this is a frontier site.<p>

i am confronted with the choice of not reading discuss or hacking URLs in order to read it. a lose-lose, and i don't see where the great benefit for userland is.
