Just fantastic, and sooooo many possiblities i have a hard time keeping it focused. But, i have a problem, i can not decide which platform to go for. I love the Mac and its ease of use and automation with apple events etc. but am told the windows version is a much more powerful solution if i want to run something like ETP.<p>

Can someone please help me. What are the pro's and con's of each.<p>

Thank in advance.
