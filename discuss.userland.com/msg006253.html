Success breeds work. We've won a one year contract (with extensions) that calls for us to supply a senior webmaster/project manager and a junior webmaster to a government agency with a 5000 page and growing website. This is a website that needs to move from the "wild west" stage to something more orderly and controlled, without losing its flair and cutting edge.<p>

Key skills for the senior webmaster/project manager:<ul><p>

	<li>experience with web publishing/scripting systems, including Frontier
	<li>ColdFusion
<li>familiarity with Sun Solaris and Apache
	<li>people and project management skills</ul><p>

Key skills for the junior webmaster<ul><p>

	<li>Cold Fusion desirable
	<li>javascript desirable
	<li>Frontier desirable
	<li>Apache/Solaris desirable
	<li>quality control</ul><p>

These jobs are on-site, in DC. Telecommuting on some days is a possibility.<p>
