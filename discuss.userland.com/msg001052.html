It's 56k, and after about 50 percent the page load chokes. If I view source, I can see the beginning links, but after it dies, the <table> never gets finished, so it doesn't show up (NC4.5/Mac).<p>

Would it be too much to make each entry a table? This would let each entry appear as soon as it was loaded, rather than the layout engine having to wait for the whole <table> for the day to complete. Then if the download chokes, at least you get the beginning links, which are the most recent anyway.<p>

Just some thoughts-
