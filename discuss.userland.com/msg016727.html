The ? is a command, where as the $<value> gets searched for and replaced in every string.

It only seems to be a problem when a script sends a value to another script.

My situation is that I call lynx, which on this system is actually an suid program that calls a lynx-wrapper.pl, which in term checks some system settings, and calls lynx with the approprate command lines.  It sucks, but thats what I am forced to use.  :-P

My sysadmins aren't the most attentive, so I can't get them to help.  I can pass things OK to lynx, but it seems to be a Program->calling script->calling program problem.  If I had the disk quota, I would compile my own version of lynx, but alas I am trapped.
