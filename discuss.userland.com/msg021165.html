Forget power. Forget food, shelter or the need to belong. The more I listen to people talking about their lives, and the more I ponder the highs and lows of human behaviour, the more I'm convinced that, in a society like ours, the most fundamental of all human needs is the need to be taken seriously.

I think we're on the same side on the important issues, believe it or not.
