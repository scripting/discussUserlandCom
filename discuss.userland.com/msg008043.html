They made it look pretty, but really screwed with the site fucntionality. The site for information technology professional's basically ran a beta test with its' audience, and has lost many of them to the register.<p>

 Loads slowly
 Lacks what made it attractive before (short summaries)
 Features don't work (the news page was blank for a long time)
 Search engine broke
 
 The real complaint was with the new forum software, which they outsourced to programmers who are clueless about html.<p>

People have not been quiet.<p>
