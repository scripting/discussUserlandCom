Third Voice is a method of communication.  People can find positive as well as negative uses for it.  The media went through a stage during the internet's infancy where it seemed that all the internet was used for was kiddie porn and bomb-building instructions.  The media got it wrong.  It was just a medium for communication.  People could also convey bomb-building info using a cell phone, fax, or a pen and paper, but we didn't get our knickers in a knot over those.
