You're going to see messages posted here and on other DGs by people who are using Radio UserLand. They're going to say even more things that make no sense in the context of the HTML web. The only way to understand it is to jump onto the other side, and start using the structure of the Internet. Instead of a fuzzy view, you hop around with ease. Bookmarks are so much more powerful. What else can I say. How would you explain the Web if someone had never used the Web?
