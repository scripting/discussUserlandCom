Is this the same thing as what Netscape calls Western encoding in its Edit > Preferences > Appearance > Fonts pane? It doesn't seem to obviously follow that it is, because the other language "scripts" that the Internet control panel offers don't match the lists of encodings that both Netscape and IE offer in their View > Character Set (Netscape)/Encoding (IE) submenu. So... are the encodings Latin-based (according to the Internet control panel), Western (as defined by Netscape) and Western European (ISO) as termed by IE, all the same thing or not?<p>

If not, then IE is completely lacking in its interface the way to change the encoding faces, which it should offer, in order to be consistent with other programs that maintain their own local preferences, or else it needs to start paying attention to the Internet control panel's prefs!<p>
