I guess the reason you can't do it in the c shell (alone) is because there isn't a way to make tcp/ip calls and these other tools (like perl) are a little more rubust and proper programming tools than the c shell.  It's just that the c shell is so nice for folks like me (bonehead scientists trying to get their job done).<p>
