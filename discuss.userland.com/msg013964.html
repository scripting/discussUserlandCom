but, after hitting submit and looking around I don't see any bookmarks!?! I'm logged in, what have I missed?<p>

OK, so now (2 minutes later) they show up in some places - still confused<p>

I'll just chill for a few minutes, on www.scripting.com the bookmarks show up, but are not active links, and are in a different format from the news.userland.com page (the other place where they show and are links)<p>
