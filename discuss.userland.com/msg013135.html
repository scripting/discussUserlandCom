string-matching language posted on scripting news.<p>

unfortunately, I didn't keep the URL, and I cannot
find it through userland's search engine (it only
gives me really weird hits whatever I search for,
but I suppose that's me ;-).<p>

does anyone remember that language?<p>

(or is there maybe a page containing the scripting news
for a whole month somewhere on this site, so I can go look
for it myself?)
