1)insist that information flow through email<p>


2)study sales data online to share insights easily<p>


3)shift knowledge workers into high-level thinking<p>


4)use digital tools to create virtual teams<p>


5)convert every paper process to a digital process<p>


6)use digital tools to eliminate single-task jobs<p>


7)create a digital feedback loop<p>


8)use digital systems to route customer complaints immediately<p>


9)use digital communication to redefine the boundaries<p>


10)transform every business practice into just-in-time delivery<p>


11)use digital delivery to eliminate the middle man<p>

12)use digital tools to help customers solve problems for themselves.<p>

Can you see just by those subject headings how many categories F6 might be used?<p>

Just food for thought.
