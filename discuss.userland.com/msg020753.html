Regarding IP, there a couple of related quantitative changes underway on the internet:<p>

<li>The number of nodes on the network is increasing rapidly</li>
<li>The amount of information available to those nodes is also increasing rapidly</li><p>

To suggest that these changes will not lead to a radical reshaping of society  and its laws is, to say the least, a questionable proposition.<p>

How then would you expect "theft" to be defined, morally and legally, in say twenty years?<p>

It's obvious, I trust, that I'm just floating a balloon here... don't think that I'm a dot-commie just because I'm quoting Engels. :o)
