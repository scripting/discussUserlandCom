Good morning!<p>

Wanted to give you a heads up on Microsoft's plans to publish the MSN
Messenger protocol for the industry as a significant step in furthering our
commitment to instant messaging interoperability. Today's announcement of
publishing the protocol provides an interim solution to meet strong consumer
demand for open communications. Our experience is that consumers are
demanding interoperability between various instant messaging services now.
So, as we continue to work with the rest of the instant messaging industry
on the development of an IETF/IMPP approved standard, Microsoft is
demonstrating its commitment to consumers by publishing its protocol to make
it easy for other instant messaging services to communicate with MSN
Messenger today. As noted in the attached press release, key partners in the
industry are applauding Microsoft's decision to move interoperability
forward for the consumer with this announcement to publish its protocol. <p>

Also important to note is that since the MSN Messenger Service launched just
three weeks ago, there are already 1.3 million people using the service
today, which represents the incredible demand for this service and
interoperability with other instant messenger products.<p>

Please check out the following press release for more details and let us
know if you're interested in speaking to a Microsoft spokesperson as well.  <p>

Sincerely,<p>

Microsoft to Publish MSN Messenger Service Protocol to Industry
Furthers Commitment to Instant Messaging Interoperability; Provides Solution
to Meet Strong Consumer Demand for Open Communications 
REDMOND, Wash. - Aug. 18, 1999 - Microsoft Corp. today announced plans to
publish the protocol for its MSN(tm) Messenger Service, the free* Internet
messaging service that allows people to communicate instantly across the
Internet with the greatest number of Internet users and offers the tightest
integration with popular Microsoft(r) communications tools. In publishing
the MSN Messenger Service protocol, Microsoft further demonstrates its
ongoing commitment to provide all consumers with the ability to freely
communicate over the Internet, no matter which instant messaging service
they use. As evidence of consumer demand for interoperability, Microsoft
also today announced that more than 1.3 million people in the United States
use MSN Messenger Service, making it one of the fastest growing instant
messaging services.
"Our goal is to help people enjoy the benefits of free and open
communication on the Internet, and we are pleased that this is resonating
with so many consumers," said Brad Chase, senior vice president, Consumer
and Commerce Group, Microsoft. "Since 1997, Microsoft has actively worked
with the industry on open standards for interoperability among messaging
systems, and documenting our protocol is a significant step in this
direction." 
The publishing of the MSN Messenger Service protocol makes it easy for other
instant messaging services to communicate with MSN Messenger Service today
and represents a critical interim step to meet consumer demand until an
industry standard can be developed and ratified.
"We are delighted that Microsoft is publishing the specification of the MSN
Messenger protocol as an IETF draft. The publication of different protocols
helps us in evaluating our Requirements document and in informing our
development of robust, open protocols for Internetwide interoperability in
this area," said Vijay Saraswat, who with Dave Marvit is co-chair of the
IMPP Working Group of the IETF. "In this spirit of open protocols that
benefit the entire Internet community, we strongly encourage other vendors
to publish their protocols."
Microsoft's top priority continues to be working with the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) and other companies in the industry toward the
adoption of a permanent standard for instant messaging interoperability on
behalf of all consumers. In 1997, Microsoft introduced a proposal to the
IETF for the first standard for instant messaging interoperability, and it
continues to be an active member of the Instant Messaging and Presence
Protocol (IMPP) working group. 
Microsoft will make the MSN Messenger Service protocol available to the
industry by the end of this month by submitting it as an Internet draft to
the IETF as a working reference implementation of an interoperable instant
messaging protocol. Developers may also use the reference implementation to
provide interoperability. Ultimately, when the IMPP protocol is developed
and ratified, the MSN network of Internet services will support the IMPP
protocol. 
"An interim protocol is the industry's rallying point, from which we can
connect millions of users within weeks. Working from a single, common
standard will greatly accelerate the process of establishing
interoperability among all messaging systems," said Bill Kirkner, chief
technology officer, Prodigy Communications Corp. "Microsoft is doing the
right thing - publishing a protocol for everyone to use shows that it is
doing more than paying lip service to the idea of an open standard." 
"We applaud Microsoft's decision to publish its MSN Messenger Service
protocol, as it is an important first step toward creating open Internet
communications," said Joseph Esposito, president and CEO of Tribal Voice
Inc. "Open standards for instant messaging and online presence will benefit
consumers and business alike. Consumers will have freedom to communicate,
and businesses will be able to develop a new generation of products and
services built on a common communications standard."
"Microsoft's decision to introduce its MSN Messenger Service protocol is a
real
victory for consumers," said Steve Glenn, CEO of PeopleLink Inc. "Consumers
always benefit from choice. With the support of Microsoft and others,
consumers will soon be able to choose the instant messaging service that
best addresses their individual needs."
Founded in 1975, Microsoft (Nasdaq "MSFT") is the worldwide leader in
software for personal computers. The company offers a wide range of products
and services for business and personal use, each designed with the mission
of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take advantage of the
full power of personal computing every day.
