I am tooling around with MailToTheFuture (cooool), and have come across some differences between what the docs say and what is returned.  What I'm seeking here is just simple clarification!<p>

1) The deleteMessage docs claim that it returns an empty string if it succeeds.  However, when I tried it, it returned something like <boolean>1</boolean>.<p>

Okay.  Is it supposed to return a boolean meaning that it succeeded or not?  And what's with the 1?  Is that supposed to be "true"?  Or is it really returning the the number of the message deleted?<p>

2) setMessage returns the same curious <boolean>1</boolean> that I can't figure out.  Does it mean the same thing (the docs are totally silent on this one)?<p>

3) I can't quite put my finger on what getAllMessages returns.  Is this a dynamicly sized struct with each member name a unique number?  If so, would it make more sense to have an <array> of <struct>s?<p>

Also, Dave, would you mind terribly if I made a standalone app with MailToTheFuture functionality?<p>

Thanks for listening!
