Therefore the main purpose of Third Voice annotations is to post things the website author won't like. No wonder authors don't like it...<p>Third Voice really seems to be a weak attempt at the reputation markets people talk about--a way of getting independent viewpoints associated with a website. It leaves out the nifty cryptographic parts, and doesn't give you any way of checking the reputation of the people making the comments...or the reputation of people who commented on the reputation of people making comments...etc. Note that with cryptography, you can have consistent secure identities, with reputations, and still have anonymity.</p>
