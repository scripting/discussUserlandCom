Apple's Keychain provides services that the client typically provides. His solution is to move some of the services that typically get managed on the server into something like Apple's keychain. <p>

The problem is that there currently is no mechanism for a web server to say definitively, 'Hey, gimme your credit card number'. That's what's missing. Shoving that data in Keychain would then make sense. A standardized XML 'wallet' format that the browser could then yank out of Keychain with approval from the user would do nicely.
