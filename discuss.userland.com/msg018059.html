But I don't know how to explain it any better than I already did.<p>

I suppose I could have said this:<p>

<i>The feature request is to install wireless networking in that facility, and provide loaner cards to laptop users. Document the feature on the Web, so that people coming to a Microsoft conference know what they have to do in advance to have a Microsoft-conference-center-ready laptop.</i><p>

Sometimes it's better to count on people to be able to infer. <p>

Otherwise all writing would be like a stereo manual.
