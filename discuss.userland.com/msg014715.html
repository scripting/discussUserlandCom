I'm not entirely sure about the flash, but I'm working on it.<p>

I can get a rough version of the entire messagereader page displaying in Shockwave (with Director) which also antialiases text.  A dcr that just grabs and displays anti-aliased text would be very small.<p>

The problem is this system does the entire page.  Initially what we want is the central content within the plug-in, not the entire web page.  Is there any way to just grab the html content of the story that get's displayed (not the accessory site stuff)?<p>

Although there are a lot of cool possibilities if the whole web site can be driven by manilla, but I'd say XML-RPC in Flash is a ways off.<p>
