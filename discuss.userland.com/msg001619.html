You obviously missed the long article about Henry Hyde in
the LA Times last week. Hyde was the Republican points-man on
the House Iran Contra Committee. The article was full of
quotes from Hyde about how lying was OK if it was in the right
cause. Hydes position was very clear. Regans gross
subversion of the constitution, and all the lying to cover
it up was legitimate because it was done to "fight
communism". Not much integrity there.<p>

There was no great regard for the rule of law when the
felony was done by someone he supported. Not only that but
Hyde did everything they could do to hinder the
investigation.<p>

That's why I have complete contempt for the Republican Party
at the moment. Those Republicans who make the most noise about Clintons crimes are all hypocrites  of the worst sort. Those make a big fuss about morality have all sinned worse than Clinton. Dan
Burton comes to mind. And those who make such a big deal
about the rule of law nearly all defended Regans complete
contempt for the Constitution, the laws of Congress, and his
perjury in front of the Iran-Contra Grand Jury.<p>

One fact I dont see metioned very often is that articles of impeachment were sent to the House for both Regan and Bush. In both cases the actually did commit high crimes. In both cases the Democratic leadership knew the would not get the 2/3's majority in the senate so, unlike the current Republicans, they showed some statesmanship.<p>

The reason why Clinton has 73&#169;ositives at the moment is
because the most people realize that those who are attacking
Clinton strongest are worse scoundrels than Clinton. Paula
Jones lied about her 'harassment'. Clinton was giving a
speech when it was supposed to have happened. Reinquists
partisan overturning of presidential privilege, going
against everything he had said and written previously.
Starrs accepting the special prosecutor job even though he
had argued in front of the Supreme Court that the special
prosecutor was unconstitutional. Starrs lying about evidence
to Reno so that he could expand the Whitewater investigation
to cover Lewinsky... The lies go on and on.<p>

If you really care about the rule of law you should be very
worried that Clinton has been impeached almost totally on
evidence that would be inadmissible in a real court of law.
That the whole process has had nothing to do with due
process, and everything to do with rail-roading...<p>

And if you care about the constitution you should be very
worried that the clique who currently rule the Republican
Party, and whose ideology is supported by less than 20&#168;f the
electorate, can try to overturn the results of two
presidential elections by using their small House majority
to rail-road the president. <p>

Clinton won two elections fair and square, and then co-opted
the "Republican Revolution" of 1994. That is his real crime.
It has everything to do with politics, and nothing to do
with morality or the rule of law.<p>
