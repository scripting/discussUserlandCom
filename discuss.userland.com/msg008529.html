Regular Expressions: <a href="http://www.sunworld.com/swol-07-1999/swol-07-regex.html">Scripting Makes Enterprise Programming Easier</a>. "In addition to Frontier, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, and Tcl coming together on XML-RPC territory, there are also hints that leading Web development tool vendors are deciding whether to support it. Growing use of XML and comfort with multilingualism can only expand interest in XML-RPC."<p>

<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$40">XML-RPC.COM</a>: Edd Dumbill suggests a higher-level set of standard procedure calls that allow external callers to find out what services are available. <i>Good!</i><p>

SJ Merc: <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/premium/business/docs/nolan16.htm">Chris Nolan Suspended in Stock Controversy</a>. I agree with others who have commented. Every pub has to define the integrity lines it won't cross. The Merc has high standards in the current climate. For example, Fortune employs two venture capitalists as columnists, Stewart Alsop and Bill Gurley. Their conflicts are right in the reader's face. In a <a href="http://cgi.pathfinder.com/fortune/technology/alsop/1999/06/21/index.html">recent column</a> Alsop promoted one of his investments, one that's competitive with UserLand. Oooops. There's my conflict!<p>

Bill Gurley: <a href="http://cgi.pathfinder.com/fortune/technology/gurley/1999/08/02/index.html">You Say You Want a Revolution</a>? "A programming project distributed across a large group of empowered developers moves faster than a project controlled by a single entity."<p>
