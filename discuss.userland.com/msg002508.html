I disagree. RMI works via <a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/rmi/doc/serial-spec/serialTOC.doc.html>Java Object Serialization</a>, which requires exact Java class information of all transmitted objects to be present at both the sending and the receiving end. And because all Java classes subclass other classes and Serialization wraps superclass info onion-style, you'll need the whole Java class library in addition to your application classes. <p>

Of course, there's the Java-to-IDL mapping, but I don't think Sun is proposing to put full CORBA ORBs into cell phones and microwave ovens.
