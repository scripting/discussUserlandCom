Intelligent caching and compression algorithms have <b>way</b> more potential than what we have already seen.  Your comments on cd size == 0.5gb reminds me of a presentation Nathan Myrvhold did: the movie "Evita" is approx. 4gb, but since the difference in human DNA is something like 0.2%, if you use a fairly naive compression algorithm, you can represent any human (including Madonna) in 1.2mb data -- a floppy! (Not sure what the relevance is, except my daughter will be growing old in a very different world than I now occupy).
