IE is ignoring the setting. You'll have to edit the registry to change your web page font. Glad to know that MS is making their software easier and easier to use. (I know, it's beta software, but I couldn't resist.)<p>

I was able to get IE to use a different font only by editing the registry, logging out of NT, and logging back in.<p>

Call up regedit.
Go to:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Internet Explorer/International/1252
Right click on IEPropFontName
Type in Arial (though i recommend Verdana)<p>

Exit Regedit
Log out
Log back in.<p>

And as MS always says, if you edit your registry be prepared to lose everything if you blink the wrong way!
