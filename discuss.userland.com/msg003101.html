In terms of improving upon the collaborative aspect - it's almost as if you wanted something like Timbuktu or PowWow for editing.<p>

Timbuktu in that one person controls the screen, and PowWow in that one person drives the web-browsing of others who "log on".<p>


I think realtime technography will be a cool thing - what would be interesting is if you could have more than one technographer - one for say content, and another for say layout - where they could both interact and not interfere with one another.<p>
