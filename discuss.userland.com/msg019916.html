(If I had spent as much time back then learning C programming, I'd spend more time <i>writing</i> open-source software than pontificating about it, but old habits die hard.  :-)  Eric S. Raymond was one of my nemeses on those groups.  Never mind guns.  ESR is a staunch <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/anarchist.html">anarcho</a>-<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/libgates.html">libertarian</a>, and believes that nobody has the right to take his private property or interfere with his freedom of contract for any purpose.
<p>
I thought, and still do think, that ESR's political ideas are meshuggah.  However, compared with most other libertarians who infest the Net, he has <i>thought</i> about those ideas in some depth, and is articulate and reasonable in defending and expounding on them.
<p>
Furthermore, observing ESR's writings on open-source matters, I'm impressed that in general, he has <i>not</i> turned his prominence as an open-source spokesman into a hobbyhorse for his other political ideas.
<p>
The .sig in his email usually has some pro-gun quote, but that sentiment is <i>restricted</i> to the .sig.  When the open-source movement got an award from Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, ESR's <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cpsr-speech.html">acceptance speech</a> certainly laid out his view of what "social responsibility" means -- but since RMS, Larry Wall, and Brian Behlendorf were also invited to give speeches, I think the political diversity of the movement was adequately represented there.  ESR's personal home page contains various political writings and links -- but that's his <i>personal</i> home page.
<p>
As a confirmed pinko who's sympathetic to the open-source movement, I think ESR is doing a damn good job, and I don't feel threatened by his political views.
<p>
When people rumble about ESR and guns and how this reflects badly on the open-source movement, are they referring to the things I mentioned above?  Or is he spouting politics on open-source platforms more often than I have noticed?
