I'm just learning Frontier (today)!
I dont know what Frontier does quite yet, in order to answer your questions, but perhaps I can talk about what Dreamweaver does...<p>

Templates have two components: the "layout" and the "content" or the editable fields.
You can create a template file from any HTML.
One thing you can do is label fields in the template and then have an xml file with content that can be "merged" into the template.
So you sort of get this "content divorced from layout" feature.<p>

Dreamweaver is extensible via simple HTML and javascript.
So say I wanted to create a command that walked through every image on a page and changed it's border to 0 - I would just walk the DOM of that page and do setAttribute() or whatever the DOM command is.<p>

I can talk more but I must run for now - Im trying to learn Frontier quickly enough that I can set up an internal server to allow members of our group to collaborate and have feedback.... I hope this is possible "easily".<p>

One note - Dreamweaver can view any arbitrary XML file, and using the custom tags extenstions it can work with them just as if they were any other ordinary HTML - you can even build custom "inspectors" which are the form-like property views you get when you pick a certain element on a page - for instance ifyou pick an image, the inspector changes to something that views the src, the borders, margins, etc.  And ifyou had a custom tag like BANK - you can make a BANK icon show up in DW with a custom tag def, and when you click on the BANK icon, the inspector could show BANK properties like AMT, AGE, HOLDINGS, etc. and from that do any kind of arbitrary manipulation of the page (like
if the user makes the HOLDINGS property over $100 the background of the page turns green )
