I noticed a few days ago that it had been working but now it isn't. Could the button be removed? (I kept clicking on it to get rid of the New Jersey Resume links, to no avail.)</i><p>

The "Exclude" button on my.userland.com is actually hooked up to the Linux site. The NT and the Linux sites are just separate user interfaces for the same database.<p>

I expect that many parts of the interface will continue to live on NT, at least for the forseeable future.<p>
