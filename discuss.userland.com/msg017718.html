It would be great if the editors of these sites could recruit co-managing editors, people are coming to the site, presumably based on placement in search engine results, and it's a shame to disappoint the people. With a handful of MEs, these sites could be ongoing resources and the people involved could take vacations, or move on to different projects.<p>

Another thought, the all-time most-read site is not the best looking Manila site. Perhaps someone with some real design talent could help <a href="http://themes.editthispage.com/">Matty</a> out? Matty are you open to getting some free design work?
