I know that Slashdot is run off of linux, and yesterday they <i> served up 539020 pages to 79410 unique IPs ... </i>  (from <a href="http://slashdot.org/about.shtml">http://slashdot.org/about.shtml</a>)  Their images come from a seperate source at a different ISP.  Their pages typically are about 50k or so, so they're kicking out some serious bandwidth.<p>

A little while ago they were running this off of a single machine, a dual p-2 266 w/ 256 megs of memory. This machine was running their DB and perl scripts that make up the dynamic content of the site. (Rendered every minute to static pages)<p>

They recently obtained a superhonker of their own (3/8/99), so they may be serving off of that now. (Dual P2/450 with 512 megs of RAM) But I'm sure it's still running linux.
