From what I've seen, it is largely used by industrial software suppliers--i.e., folks who write custom software for other companies, but not by consumer/PC software folks.  This certainly applies to the Level 5 organizations I've heard of.<p>

Is the CMM not used by the folks who develop the applications we rely on every day?  If not, why not?<p>

As consumers, would we be more likely to trust software developed by a CMM-certified house?
