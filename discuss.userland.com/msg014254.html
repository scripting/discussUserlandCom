If you like Macintosh ease-of-use, I encourage you to support "MacBird". Tell developers you know, no matter what OS they develop for, that we've released the full C source code, under the MIT Open Source license, for a user interface design tool that conforms to the standard Macintosh UI.<p>

In the ironic world of the Internet, if MacBird should be ported universally, on Windows, Be OS and Linux, as examples, you'll find that developers will be more likely to take advantage of the user interface capabilities of the Macintosh.<p>

<b>Who are MacBird's users?</b><p>

In talking with a reporter last week, the discussion led to a question that I had not previously answered. Who will use MacBird, if it is ported to all these platforms? That was a really good question!<p>

Here's my answer:<ul><p>

<li>People who developed Director movies, or Hypercard stacks.<p>

<li>People who design, and even write for, websites. The skills used in the Advanced Prefs of a Manila website are very close to the skills needed to be an effective MacBird designer.<p>

<li>People who develop or developed Mac or Windows apps before the Internet happened.
</ul><p>

There may be others I haven't thought of. I keep talking with people and listening, and they keep opening my eyes to see other audiences our stuff could be useful to.
