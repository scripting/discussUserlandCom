In utopia, no fee would be required. However, in the world I live in, funded projects and organizations *tend* to be more successful than non-funded ones. Also, members *tend* to take their memberships more seriously when they've had to pay something to join.<p>

<b>Other problems with a totally free system:</b><p>

1. Somebody's going to have too much control. Whoever organized it, or provides the server or the bandwidth, will have too much implied authority because it's "their system".<p>

2. Too much noise on completely "open" discussion lists.<p>

I'd be less inclined to join (or at least expect a lot less of the organization) if it was completely free than I would if it cost a little bit.<p>
