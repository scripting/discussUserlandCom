Okay, I think I'm getting closer to understanding your point.<p>

Is this similar to the Mac's User Interface Guidelines?  If so, then I'm 100% in your camp.<p>

Does this mean that it should be tough to deviate from the basic model?  Like with Manila -- you can change EVERYTHING if you want to, but it's far easier to leave most of the elements the same and just tweak colors and maybe a little bit of layout.<p>

Could this be done by providing an easily useable XUL framework?  Sort of like MacApp and the like.
