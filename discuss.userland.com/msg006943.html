It isn't there yet, but here is a simple screen shot...<p>

What's going on is that a button is being pushed, just like the 'Edit in Browser. that has the message number in on the applet's parameters.  When the applet is loaded, the page is requested via xml-rpc.  Because this server is on UNIX, I have to go through a proxy webserver which makes the actual request to nirvana.userland.com.<p>

I'm going to add various menu's which will allow for Bold, Italics, and other supported HTML...  Any suggestions would be appreciated.<p>

My question is if there is a way to update a DG message via xml-rpc?  I can get the message but can I update it?<p>

thanks,<br>
