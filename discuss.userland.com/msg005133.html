In other words, this is useful if you don't want members of one site to have access to the other site.For details see: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5101">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5101</a>	<i>Note: a security hole in the attached sample website was fixed on 4/22/99. See <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tree$2.6.4.1">http://frontier.userland.com/tree$2.6.4.1</a> for details.</i>Download	The sample is attached as a fatpage. To get it, choose Enclosure: fatpage above. If you have the editorial suite running you can use Enclosure: RPC. Instructions	This table should be a subtable of htmlInterfaces.root.	Double-check the #urls table. These will work if your default domain (config.mainresponder.domains.default) is set to the www subfolder of your Guest Databases folder.	Setup a new table in discuss.root. The name should be the same as that of the #discussionRoot entry in this table (testTable by default).  Inside this table, create three sub-tables named calendar, messages, and prefs. Inside the prefs table, create a number object named nextMsgNum and set its value to 1.	Setup a new table in members.root. The name should be the same as the #members entry in this table (test by default). Note that the #members directive is also present in testDiscuss.edit and testDiscuss.public!	If you haven't changed the default domain or #urls table, you should be able to signup at: localhost/htmlInterfaces/testDiscuss/	You may get error messages until you post a message from: localhost/htmlInterfaces/testDiscuss/edit/newThread$	Sorry, no warranties. Good luck!<p><p>
