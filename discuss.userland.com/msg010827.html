I hope we don't divide up into people who want their apps on servers and people who don't.  As I said in my original post, I think there is a lot of potential on the server.  That is a given.  But, now having risen to the level of someone who can run their own server, I'd like to think that I could find a way to help bring the power of the server to other people without forcing them to be clients (paying one way or another) of the people who control the servers.<p>

I forsee a market, where there are relatively easy to maintain home servers (running Linux?) which can serve several PCs in a home (via wireless?)  Perhaps you can get online help to configure things if you have trouble with that.  This is pretty much the kind of setup I am running at my home.  I even provide an extra email account for my mom (who has her own ISP.)<p>

Somehow, it seems much more empowering to keep control of the server in my own domain rather than to give it up to some big internet vendor.<p>

(Granted, we'll always be tied together via the net, but I want to be an island in the net, not a raft being towed by someone elses boat)<p>

(one more thought - wouldn't it be neat if neighborhoods banded together and bought their own high speed bandwidth, rather than being sold to piecemeal by the telcos / cablecos / isps?  - there has to be a lot of wasted bandwidth in the current system.)
