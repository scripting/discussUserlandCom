Nor are you typical of software artists. You made a large enough profit from Living VideoText that you could afford to work on Frontier not for the money, but to express yourself. That's certainly what I -- and probably many -- would do if in as fortunate a position. For now, I must work for both reasons.<p>

As for Napster, the <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/business/top/002607.htm">Shawn Fanning quote from the July 2 Mercury News,</a> "I didn't do this for the last year just for fun, that's for sure," wasn't in the context of artistic expression.
