It is a specification and it's scalability will only proportional to the language and platform it happens to be implemented on , no?<p>

Anyway, in my case it just directly calls a COM object from the web page and returns the value, so what's unscalable about that? I have worked on sites and tested site with >1000 hits per second, so I don't see problems myself.<p>

Anyway, the functionality offered by XML-RPC will make it more usable and popular than anything just now, no matter how scalable it is.<p>
