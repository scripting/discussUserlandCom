<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10634">Paul Howson</a> needs this script too. "It amazes me that the people who create these programs have not forseen this problem." <i>Amen!</i><p>

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/09/07/FloatingIdeas">9/7/96</a>: "People with an extra computer can have their own search engines. All their written work is filtered, cross-indexed and sorted. If you can make it flow thru email, it can be more useful to you. The other machine, your mail organizing database, is busy categorizing and sorting things while you're writing and reading. This is not beyond the leading edge. We can set up these kinds of servers now, in 1996."<p>

"The StarOffice release is definitely good for Linux, but its non-Open-Source nature also raises some concern. Could Sun be building ammunition for its next war? StarOffice may also be an attempt to gain long-term control over the Linux desktop market."<p>

Moving forward. Now you <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$388">can attach enclosures</a> to messages thru the XML-RPC interface.<p>
