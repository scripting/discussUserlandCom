Have you considered changing the name scriptingNews?  I have been a scripting news/davenet reader for (four) years, and continue to find value and insight in your writings.<p>

That being said, the content/mandate of SN has drifted from its name.  It's not really about scripting that much these days.  So perhaps it is time to rename SN to reflect its continured evolution.<p>
