In the case of Carbon, the application developer
has to do the conversion.<p>

In the case of WINE, the application developer
doesn't do anything at all. WINE itself does
the conversion.<p>

It sounds more like the technology Digital had in
the Alpha port of NT. They had the x86 emulator,
but they also had a technology which would convert
the x86 code to Alpha code on the fly.
