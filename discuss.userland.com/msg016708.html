If you didn't see Frontier as one of these, I would feel unhappy using it as such. <p>

The front page of www.userland.com says, inter alia,
"Frontier is a HTTP server, programming, database and XML environment used to build and publish big-content news-oriented sites that are easy to manage, for developers, writers and designers."<p>

To me this is not quite the same thing, so I am glad for your clarification.<p>

 What do you see the limits of Frontier as a web application environment / server, would it be within intended parameters for it to be used as the tool for a fully fledged 'thin client' application, using the ODB to store user information and writing the business logic in UserScript?
