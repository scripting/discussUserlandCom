# discuss.userland.com

This is a restoration of discuss.userland.com, the first discussion group in the blogosphere. 

This discussion group was live from <a href="msg000001.html">October 5, 1998 </a>to <a href="msg021856.html">September 29, 2000</a>. 

The first message is <a href="msg000001.html">msg000001.html</a>, and from there you can get to all the other messages by clicking on links.

You'll see a lot of the early bloggers writing here, before their blogs started. 

Lots of possibilities for little projects, like looking for historic posts, where ideas that became something were first discussed. Or all the posts from someone who became an influencer or super rich. Maybe that'll come later. For now I wanted to get this on the open web so it can be indexed by search engines and preserved by archive.org. 

The content for this site is <a href="https://github.com/scripting/discussUserlandCom/">hosted on GitHub</a>, so that's another backup. :-)
