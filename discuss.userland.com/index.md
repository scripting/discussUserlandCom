# discuss.userland.com

A restoration of <a href="https://discuss.userland.com/">discuss.userland.com</a>, from 27 years in the future.

The first message in discuss.userland.com is <a href="msg000001.html">msg000001.html</a>, and from there you can get to all the other messages.

You'll see a lot of the early bloggers writing here, <i>before</i> their blogs started. 

Lots of possibilities for little projects, like looking for historic posts, where ideas that became something were first discussed. Or all the posts from someone who became an influencer or super rich. Maybe that'll come later. For now I wanted to get this on the open web so it can be indexed by search engines and preserved by archive.org. 

The content for this site is hosted on GitHub, so that's another backup. :-)
