All of the HTML and scripts are stored in files on our web site.  I would prefer to have all the files stored in a revision Control system.  That way, if someone messes the HTML up, I can revert the file(so it works again) and find out who is responsible(the one who checked the offending file in) and correct it.  <p>

Most of the information I am dealing with is fairly technical and really should be dealt with by the ones who are actually generating the data.  I can train them on HTML all I want, but people are going to make mistakes.  And mistakes cost money.<p>

I don't need it for code.  I need it to keep a moderatly complex website under control.  I have seen people use CVS for this, and it works well.  I know Source Safe has some support for web pages built in.(I think the new version 6 might have better support)  I thought Frontier would be good for this, especially since I would be able to easily do things like have a bug report page, where users could auto-revert changes if there is a problem with a URL.  <p>

If this isn't something you think Frontier would be good for I can understand.  Just throwing an idea out there.
