As with any one-sentance answer to a potentially complicated question, that may leave a bit out and blur the edges a bit.  <p>

Other random thoughts:
<UL>
<LI>"Dictatorships" are a practical necessity. Without strong leadership, the product will usually/always fall apart if/when it becomes large.</LI>
<LI>You always have the option of a dictatorship (code) fork. But since people vote with their feet, and inertia is a strong non-force, not many people will follow.  The choice is there, and real, though, which is importent.</LI>
<LI>The bazaar is real; the dictatorships are just one booth. (In other words, we're talking things on the size of a single vendor, not a government).</LI>
</UL><p>

After all, it's just a metaphor.  It doesn't have to carry the strongly negative connotations it does in the real world.<p>

Look for Microsoft to pick up on this... just kidding.  If Linux kernal development is a dictatorship, what does that make Microsoft?  An Orwellian, 1984 society?
