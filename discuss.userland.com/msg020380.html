<b>First, a question</b><p>

I'll be visiting SF towards the end of September, a stopover on my way to London. I'm on a road trip for the first coupla days but I will have one or two days to roam around the city on my own.<p>

Are there any conferences/BOF/whatever on at the time. I have always been jealous of the shwag people get from these things. <i>My time has come damnit!</i><p>

<b>Second, a response </b><p>

I don't like being called a hacker. And today I realised I don't like being called an artist. I think the term conveys more meaning than what I actually do for a living. I've written a little <a href="http://foaf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$527">rant on my site about it</a>, as I hear that's the appropriate thing to do.
Now I'm not saying software development isn't art...well, actually I pretty much am, but I spose what different people consider art is all really personal opinion.<p>

<b>Wow, a third</b><p>

I realise now, I also don't like thinking of myself as a "barking, farting chihuahua". For two reasons: <p>

Firstly (and most importantly) it is disrespectful to my mother who always told me to respect others and to treat them like I would be treated. I personally despise any dog smaller than my parent's daschund and I don't want to think of people the way I think of such dogs.<p>

Secondly, I may bark, but I can fart better than any chihuahua (see the above link). Dave, could you please change it the phrase to "barking, farting St Bernard".<p>

<b> That's about it</b><p>

Hope everyone has a nice evening.
