Below is the license excerpted from one of my code files.  Note the conditions under which public domain explicitly applies.  I omit the copyright because it's simple and obvious (for myself in some year).<p>

<pre>
<a href="//">//</a> LICENSE: This "ethical license" has three parts: FREE, KEEP, and PEEL:
<a href="//">//</a> 1. FREE: You are free to do anything as long as you either KEEP or PEEL;
<a href="//">//</a> 2. KEEP: You must keep the COPYRIGHT and LICENSE unchanged, or else PEEL;
<a href="//">//</a> 3. PEEL: You can peel off both COPYRIGHT and LICENSE to yield an embedded
<a href="//">//</a> public domain version of this file if and only if you remove all comments
<a href="//">//</a> from the source code written by the copyright holder; for a public domain
<a href="//">//</a> copy of this file, every single original coding comment must be removed.</pre>
