	I installed it on my new Dell win 98 box and it ran without a hitch.  I like it's feature set, but it still doesnt foster a sense of community like say gooey does, because when you go from site to site, all you see is just the people there - there's no "chat" that you can enter into - instead you must try to initiate it yourself.
