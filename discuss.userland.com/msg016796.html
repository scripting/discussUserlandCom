  Why did the music player in Win 2k improve?<p>

My answer:
  Competition. Real Jukebox has similar features. <p>

The next question:
  Would Microsoft's answer be "We improved it to match the competition" or "Our new Audio Player is an innovation in music playing technology"?<p>

And, one final question:
  Is there an example of where MS did innovation in an area where there was no competition? Does MS innovate when there are no market forces?
