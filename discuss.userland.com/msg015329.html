If this were accepted by a large enough part of the industry, it would be yet another advantage of OpenSourcing your code.  No one could come along after the fact and claim patent protection over something you had implemented in your code, because you served notice on the software development community that you had that feature already.<p>

If the courts accepted SourceForge as a sort of open code escrow, imagine how many fewer intellectual property disputes there would be, and/or how much cheaper it would be to solve those that got to court.<p>
