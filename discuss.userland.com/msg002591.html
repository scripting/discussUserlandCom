type info, so it'd get hard to map it to a XML-RPC that required 
same.  I think that extending the reach of XML-RPC to the CGI syntax
in this manner is quite interesting indeed. It allows an XML-RPC 
server to serve a much broader range of client engines than it could
previously. You as Joe-web-app-developer just get that much more 
power by focussing your sever-side development efforts under a 
XML-RPC engine who can then handle the breadth of clients all 
automatically for you. Such engines are thus that much more useful 
in the world. <p>

Just some thoughts....<p>

Adding to your thoughts on this subject....<p>

While I was looking at the XML-RPC spec, I was starting to "turn it off in my mind" because of the limited reach it was causing itself by being so strict in communicating in both directions on the wire.<p>

I think what is needed here is 2 modes of operation:<p>

1) Synchronous - Where the conversation on the wire is XML in both directions and has strict type info, as the spec is now.<p>

2) Asynchronous - Where the spec allows the server to use standard CGI methods like GET statements as well as less type info requirements for receiving.  <p>

Asynchronus mode should be the default and supported by all XML-RPC servers, and Synchronous mode should be optional.  Included would be a way to bump up the conversation to Synchronous if the server supports it.  Negotiations would be done using standard CGI methods.<p>

Talking only for harry-web-app-developer, I would find it hard, next to impossible to support a Synchronous server on most of my present web server infrastructures now and probably for the next year or two.<p>

The reason I can't support a Synchronous server is because "I" don't have complete control of how the webserver is configured, receives information and how and what libraries are configured.  This is just a fact of life for me and others.<p>

But the Asynchronous model brings me and others back into this conversation because it requires less and the infrastucture we have today can meet it's requirements.<p>

Just my thoughts....
