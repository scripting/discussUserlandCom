Hardly. Until recently it hadn't crossed my mind that there were issues here. Everyone has a different point of view. Everyone has a different cause. Even if all the web sites were accessible to everyone, there would be another problem that comes along that makes the world a fucked up place for someone.<p>

Personally, I think that breaking the logjam on encryption is that kind of issue. But I don't think everyone shares that view.
