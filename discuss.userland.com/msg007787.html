My intranetproject implemented in frontier 6.0 is making big steps forward. the only thing that disturbs me, is that the member passwords are not encrypted inside the frontier odb. actually i started to demonstrate the project at internal and external meetings; astonishing people with frontiers elegance. but when i show them the member data table the audience is shocked that especially the member passwords are not protected in any way. i am convinced that this is a important problem the frontier development team should consider.
