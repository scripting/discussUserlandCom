I settled on Mason after a spin through the usual "embedded Perl" modules (HTML::Emberp, Apache::ASP), the bits and pieces of Frontier that I saw anually (pre-Manila), and trying to grok Zope.<p>

Mason, IMHO, has more in common with Frontier and Zope than the other Perl modules, because it treats files as script components instead of "applications", for want of a better term. (This is, obviously, the briefest comparison -- and focusing entirely on observations of code/site structure than the presence or lack of ODB).<p>

What it's lacking is an integrated data-store, which is decidedly where I feel Frontier the most *elegant* of the three (and the feature that I'd kill for most).<p>

I've only used it for application development; the CMS is interesting -- more focused on "staging" components than an end-user application, but it has the most intruging online spell-checker I've seen. The CMS feels somewhat like Zope (1.x series) in its interface and structure.
