it favors large or established companies.<p>

If money comes from providing services, then you have
to have time or staff to provide those services. That
either detracts from resources available for writing
the software itself, or requires adding more staff.<p>

I don't think it's feasible for every small software
developer to follow the RedHat model and fund software
development by selling their own Linux distribution.
