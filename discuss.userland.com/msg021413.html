But not responding would be similar to ignoring you.  So I pick out a couple sentences that seem worth more effort.  Otherwise I consider this branch of the thread a deadend.  (No slight intended.)<p>

(Note I consider brevity a virtue.  I'm most likely to respond if paragraphs exceed no more than three or five lines at the most.  Otherwise a writing style can substitute volume for quality.)<p>

I don't see how this is relevant, no matter who brought it up.  Seeing it feels like a red herring, like shouting Microsoft does not discriminate against dirty socks.  Uh, who cares?<p>

Joshua Allen: <i> 
Obviously Microsoft believes that no infractions were committed </i><p>

Time out! Rather, Microsoft obviously believes they were committed.  But they strenuously deny them.  No one believes this position nor believes Microsoft takes the position seriously.  It's just a pro forma denial. When accused, one approach is to deny everything and never stop denying under any circumstances.
