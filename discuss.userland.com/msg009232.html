(It's actually easier to get vendors to support a completely new protocol on their clients & servers than it is to make sure everyone is using the same version of a protocol that's undergoing revision.)<p>

Why does it matter?  Because you absolutely MUST be able to change the protocol as necessary to pass IESG security review, and to address scalability issues.<p>
