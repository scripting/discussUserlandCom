The other way around. ";->"<p>

When I got a demo of Windows 98 from Yusuf Mehdi, a few months before it shipped, I saw that they had a command at the top of the Start menu that said "Update Windows". <p>

When I saw this, that they were trusting the Internet to update a user's operating system, given the relative lack of sophistication of Windows users when compared to Frontier users, I knew that it was time for UserLand to do the same. <p>

The result is the ever-popular <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$94">Update</a> command. So in this case, it was Microsoft's leadership, willingness to go first and innovate, that gave us the courage to do it ourselves.<p>

People assume Microsoft takes good ideas, but sometimes they do the opposite.
