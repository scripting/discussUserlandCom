Yes, the ability to edit for Manila sites is key, and longterm possibly more important than the playlist editor app. But the eye-opener, the enabler, is the radio app.</i><p>

Ah, the radio app. Wouldn't it be nice if I could have a playlist of songs, that were in an outline. How about these additional features...<p>

<ul>
<li>If I turned some of the songs in a list into comments, they would not get played (maybe I'm sick of a song, but not the whole playlist)
<li>If a song is in a special list of "songs I'm sick of" it doesn't get played.
<li>Maybe there's an easy way to make a song a member of many different lists. each list is a key. Then I could do "searches" for songs I want out of different lists. It's simple-minded and not very efficient, but when your PC runs at 900Mhz, and is waiting for keystrokes anyways....
</ul><p>

I like the last feature best, because SuperJPG (my image cataloger) has it. Imagine doing a search that looks for songs that match keys like "blues" "harp" "live" and having a background app that churns away looking at lists that match the keys and makes a list just for that....<p>

Keep it scriptable. You never really know what the folks at either end of the pipe come up with.<p>

Cheers, Ralph Hempel
