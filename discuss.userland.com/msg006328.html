I have come to depend upon netFrontier from Preston Holmes. Is there any considerations I should take into account when installing and running netFrontier in my spiffy new Frontier 6.0?<p>

What about the TCPCMD extension that was needed for 4.2? Does that need to be installed?<p>

I have yet to find a reference to netFrontier and 6.0 issues, so any info you could put me on to would really help.<p>
