The pattern's more or less the same each time: Find a high-volume website. Post a derogatory article aimed at the website's audience. Wait for the website to link to the article. Roll in the hits.</i><p>

I can back that one up. It's usually an anti-Linux troll, though, in the hope of provoking the Slashdot effect. But people are wising up, and browsing with a banner-blocking proxy such as <a href="http://www.junkbuster.com">Junkbuster</a>. Sadly, it doesn't yet have the capability to filter out cheap journalism...<p>

Consider it a backhanded compliment, if you can, that ZDNet considers you a big enough target to bring the hits in.
