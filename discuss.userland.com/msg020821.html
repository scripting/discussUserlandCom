Dave, could you explain what your problem is with it? They say that if they sell off a business or if they get bought out completely, customer information will go with the business along with the other assets.<p>

What else can they say? How can you sell a business without including the customer records?<p>

Did you read it as saying that they might sell customer information under other circumstances? Or do you want a statement from them that they will never sell a portion of their business to anyone who does not have a privacy policy as strong as their own (a sort of GPL for customer information)?<p>

Or did I miss a sentence somewhere in all the fine print of the policy?<p>
