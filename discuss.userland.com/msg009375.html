Would a court ever enforce the Infoworld policy? There has been no ruling on the Ticketmaster suit or on any other case.<p>

Are the courts actually going to rule that it is a copyright violation to point someone to a site? Am I violating copyright if I refer someone to an article in a print magazine during a telephone conversation? Am I violating copyright if I pass a handwritten Infoworld article URL to a friend? Suppose I put the URL inside an email? Am I violating copyright then?<p>

How are these cases different from putting the URL inside a web page on my site?<p>

Since there is a simple method to prevent unwanted links from the outside, the failure of Infoworld to prevent such unwanted links might even be considered tacit permission for deep links. <p>
