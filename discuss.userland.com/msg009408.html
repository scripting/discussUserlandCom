Realistically, it will be difficult to come up with a <I>business</I> case that justifies doing something like that your fellow web citizens aren't allowed to do.  I can't link to Infoworld because they're concerned about <I>X</I>?  Why then is <I>X</I> not an issue if Infoworld itself does the direct linking?  Fill in X with everything I've heard from Infoworld and others, and I don't think you can find a solution for <I>X</I> that leaves the current policy intact.
