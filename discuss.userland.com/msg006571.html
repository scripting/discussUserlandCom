Connectivity is a beautiful thing, and the Linux hackers know it. Linux speaks SMB and TCP and AppleTalk and HTTP and strange IBM protocols which have been lost in the depths of time. It reads your Amiga disks and hooks into your Acorn EcoNet. It will even mount your NTFS disks with a little work.<p>

Microsoft doesn't want Linux to speak to NT Server, but Linux does anyway. The Sambda guys are watching packets on the wire, puzzling out NT domain controllers and backup master browsers. It's hard work, but they're succeeding, if only for a moment. Sometimes they loose on benchmarks, but that's not too bad for a reverse-engineering effort.<p>

<I>It's true that some people prefer to use NT servers. And most computer users are on Windows and Mac</I><p>

Hey, Windows and Mac are good! (They must be--so many smart people seem to like them.) There's some nice stuff tucked away inside that Microsoft Developer SDK, and lots of cool software runs on Windows.<p>

How's that sound? ;-)<p>

Cheers,
Eric
