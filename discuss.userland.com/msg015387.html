We have an understanding. I think this will please everyone who's interested in distributed computing based on XML and HTTP. Everyone gets what they want. Some time to soup up SOAP, and we can go forward building apps using XML-RPC, knowing that when the next-level SOAP is ready, our apps will be compatible. <p>

Tim O'Reilly: <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/ask_tim/bezos_0300.html">My Conversation with Jeff Bezos</a>.<p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$427">Talk to us on the Web</a>. "O'Reilly made a very strong point in his initial essay. Amazon and all of us have been the beneficiaries of a mountain of free ideas. Amazon's improvements to the Web, while useful and innovative, are tiny little bumps on the mountain, yet they they stand in the way of its growth. That is what Bezos must respond to."<p>

<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/03/03/patent/index.html">Salon</a>: "When Priceline sued Mircrosoft's Expedia travel site for patent infringement in October 1999, the Net quaked. Suddenly, patents had teeth, and everyone wanted them. Intellectual property lawyers morphed into patent attorneys."<p>

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet#11">2/4/00</a>: "Jay Walker, the founder of Priceline.Com, has 60 full-time people working in teams to do nothing more than generate patents. No engineering, no scaling issues, no customer satisfaction requirements (although Walker's company appears to be good at this too), they just a file a claim at various patent offices, and wait for the engineering of the Internet to catch up."<p>

Problems on Subhonker1 today, there was about a 1 hour outage while I save-copied the big databases. It's back on the air now. Should be no data loss.<p>

Hey I got an email from TBL re yesterday's <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/03/02/theTwowayweb">piece</a>. He took me up on my offer to buy him dinner. Looks like I'm going to Boston.<p>

More namedropping. At the <a href="http://www.ilfornaio.com/restaurant_detail.asp?id=27">lunch</a> where Tim O'Reilly got the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$413">call</a> from Jeff Bezos, I talked with <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$414">Dale Dougherty</a> about <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/">The O'Reilly Network</a>. I wondered then, and still do, if we can join up with O'Reilly, adding our network of sites to theirs, and vice versa. How would you all feel about being part of what O'Reilly is doing? I think some of our sites would be a natural fit, like "Zope Newbies", "Qube Quorner" and "Linux Newbies", as examples. <p>

Best wishes to <a href="http://www.evhead.com/">Evan Williams</a> for a speedy recovery from dental surgery. Do I have any advice to offer? Well, this particular thing can only happen once in a lifetime. If his life is anything like mine (Bloat predicts it will) you'll spend many days programming like hell to get ready for some event or another. In the long-term all the marathon programming binges will melt into one, but you'll probably remember the pain of wisdom teeth forever. I sure do. (I still have two teeth that need extraction, and I've been putting it off for 10 years!)<p>

Charles Moore on Apple's Acqua: <a href="http://www.applelinks.com/articles/2000/03/20000302202926.shtml">I Just Want To Get My Work Done</a>. "After playing with it for an hour, he concluded that this new OS is a completely new operating system. 'Nothing that you have learned using a previous Mac OS will be of any use to you whatsoever. It doesn't look like a Mac, it doesn't feel like a Mac, and it certainly doesn't work like a Mac.'" <i>But it does run Mac apps, doesn't it??</i><p>
