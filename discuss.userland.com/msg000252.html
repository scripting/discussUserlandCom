Check out <a href="http://www.ceiss.org/">http://www.ceiss.org/</a> -- specifically, the 'related information' box in the side-bar.  When you click on one of the keywords, it brings you to a page that shows all of the pages (titles, descriptions and urls) associated with that keyword.  You can click on a title to go to that page.  Note that a traditional indexing/crawling search engine is *not* involved.  It's pure database lookups and associations.<p>

In the finalFilter, I associate the URL of the page with all of the words in #metaKeywords.  When you want to know what's related to a keyword, it finds all the URLs that have that word in the #metaKeywords (it's stored in a database).<p>

I haven't tried implementing your search engine for my site yet, but if it isn't looking at metaKeywords and metaDescription when it indexes, it should be.  And all stories/articles/etc. should have appropriate metaKeywords and metaDescriptions.<p>

Without that kind of support info to go by, search engines aren't going to be as accurate.<p>
