There's good news when it comes to developing a sidebar. I cliked "Customize", selected "From Others", opened "Recreation", and lo and behold there was "News Byproducts" (my site). So, it looks like the sidebar does work via RSS mechanisms. I don't know if you *have* to register as a My Netscape channel to use it, but if you are registered there it works right away.<p>
