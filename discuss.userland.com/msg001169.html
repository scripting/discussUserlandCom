(The VC   query URL is <<a href="mailto:mk:@ivt:kb/Source/isapi/q152054.htm">mk:@ivt:kb/Source/isapi/q152054.htm</a>> )<p>

As for getting IIS to allow a UI to show, you may want to experiment with turning on the "Allow Service to Interact With Desktop" for the "IIS Admin Service" and the "World Wide Publishing Service" via the Services control panel. This may, or may not work.<p>

We have written an IIS plugin which launches child processes and we've seen some unexpected behavior because of the above preference. Essentially, we got a UI when we didn't intend to have one. It turned out to be in part because the above preference was turned on. The rest is a long story involving OLE, services, child processes, how shutdown works on NT, yada yada yada.<p>
