A beautiful human piece of writing. I love Zeldman because he's generous, takes risks, and pushes boundaries. I also love my mother. She is healthy, alert, and reads this page. <i>Hi mom!</i><br><br>A new Manila feature is in the pipe, coming soon -- a special template for the home page of a site. A much-requested feature, now we totally need it for "Weblogs.Com", which has a rich home page, which is complicating <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/about">other</a> pages on the site. This is the kind of feature that many sites may not need, but if you need it, you know it. <br><br>We're also prepping the next rev of the Manila discussion group. In addition to having a topic view, it will also have a chronologic view. We're doing templates for all the elements of the discussion group so that designers can get in there and make it beautiful.<br><br><a href="http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$108">Tristan Louis</a> has suggestions for RSS 0.92.<br><br><a href="http://jake.editthispage.com/2000/10/13">Jake has</a> a list of new channels registered on My.UserLand.<br><br>Snoopin around looking for P2P-<a href="http://www.p2p.com/">related</a> <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$p2p.net">domain</a> <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$p2p.org">names</a>.<br><br>Radio UserLand: <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2968">Manila Editorial Outlines</a>.
