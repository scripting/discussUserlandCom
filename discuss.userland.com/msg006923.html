A lot of people's email address are composed by the first letter of their first name and their last name (or the whole first name and the first character of their last name). Unfortunately, inside a BIG ISP's system, most people will find that there are tons of kenG, mcSmith, dwinner or daveW ... the ISPs solve these problem by attaching a series of number or alphabets to the user's username -- so we get <a href="mailto:kenG123@aol.com">kenG123@aol.com</a>, <a href="mailto:kenG234@aol.com">kenG234@aol.com</a> ... what if kenG123 decides to leave AOL and go to MindSpring? <a href="mailto:kenG123@aol.com">kenG123@aol.com</a> may be available to another kenG (probably after certain period of time)! For people who has common names, this could happen. Now, that new <a href="mailto:kenG123@aol.com">kenG123@aol.com</a> can go to a Frontier DG, ask the Frontier server to send him the password and log in as the old <a href="mailto:kenG123@aol.com">kenG123@aol.com</a>!
