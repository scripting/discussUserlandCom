But due to the castastrophic programming of the Word->HTML export this was never an option.<p>

Especially because the HTML can't be processed in an XMLish way then -so you will loose the ability to directly process the contents in to your ODB in a way, so that you can separate specific items in a document and put them into a ODB structure (like XML documents).<p>

But anyhow:
Does anybody know a reference where I can learn how to script Word via VBscript at all?<p>
