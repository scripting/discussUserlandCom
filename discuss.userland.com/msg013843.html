If you've got a Mac and feel left out, WAPman seems to be working fine in the Palm OS Emulator, I was able to browse to the above Web site by turning on "Redirect NetLib calls to host TCP/IP".  <p>

I'm sure you've heard this a thousand times today, but I'd just like to join in my thanks for EditThisPage.Com. I'm really looking forward to putting some time in developing a nice site over the holidays - lots of pictures of food, family and friends, and writing about them too. <p>
