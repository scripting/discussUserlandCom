The article says that NSI says the problem has only been happening in the last week.  That's bull!  I've had these troubles a month ago when I tried to register my domain.  I'm still trying to clean up some lose ends.<p>

I've also had troubles with changing records.  The PGP key I submitted to allow me to change records worked once.  Now NSI claims there is no PGP for me.  What a pain.<p>

I tell you.  NSI in control makes me really nervous!  Every time I try to change something in whois I get back E-mail messages that leave me scratching my head.  Usually the first one is a confirmation that things will be changed and then I get followup messages with various contra indications similar to the one mentioned in the article.<p>
