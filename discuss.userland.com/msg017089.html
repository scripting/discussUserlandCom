But man it feels good to get this into W3C; just in time for <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$193">Amsterdam</a>. <br><br><b>Today's links</b><br><br>	<a href="http://soap.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$36">Over the weekend</a>, Andre Radke worked on getting SOAP 1.1 support into Frontier 6.2. He posted a report on our internal website, but I asked that he make it public so that other SOAP implementors can see how we're doing. Clearly interop between early implementations would be a Good Thing. IBM has already shipped one for Java, and according to Fredrik Lundh, PythonWare will soon ship one for Python.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/tech/soap4j">IBM released</a> version 1.1 of their SOAP for Java.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.mattl.com/">mattl.com</a> gets a cease and desist from Mattel. <i>Oooops.</i><br><br>	Bill Gates: <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articles/0,3266,44557,00.html">The Case For Microsoft</a>.<br><br>	<a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/scriptingNewsBofInAmsterdam">Survey</a>: A Scripting News BOF in Amsterdam?<br><br>	<a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$107">Joel</a>: "If the UI can't withstand your acting generally immature and stupid, it could use some work."<br><br>	If we had an award for the most brilliant slap your head in disbelief idea of the week, it would surely go to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$17099">Sam Yates</a> who figured out how to get Pike to work from behind a firewall without requiring any browser configuration.

Further, while the press releases have a formal corporate tone, they also have ideas, and try to explain something, to teach the reader something new, and to create a favorable impression of a company that most of the readers (we hope) have never heard of, UserLand.<br><br>	Today's press release is about SOAP 1.1. We expect to reach a milestone today. I can't say what that is, obviously, at this time. But the specific milestone is less important, imho, than the connection between small companies, independent developers, and very large technology companies. This is the realignment I've been waiting for, for pretty much my whole career. So now that my little company is getting recognition from some big ones, I want to be careful to feed back support to the individuals and companies that have supported us. This is what <i>didn't happen</i> in the Mac developer community in the 90s, each individual developer would try to make deals with Apple, but none of us wanted to make deals with each other. There were some notable exceptions, like the work we did with <a href="http://brain.biap.com/openbiap/netevents.html">NetEvents</a> and <a href="http://www.scripting.com/midas/netroot.html">Internet Config</a>. By holding hands with PythonWare and Ken MacLeod, along with IBM and Microsoft, we help build a network of collaboration that will make the benefit of large-and-small working together more than a one-shot deal.<br><br>	I'm doing a bit of follow-up to see how each of the press releases fared on the web.<br><br>	We've done two releases in the last six months, <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/12-01-1999/0001085944&EDATE=">announcing</a> Frontier 6.1/Manila, and  <a href="http://news.excite.com/news/pr/000127/ca-davos-userland">announcing</a> the Davos Newbies site. <br><br>	<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=davos+newbies&num=10&meta=hl%3Den%26lr%3D&btnG=Google+Search">Google search</a> for Davos Newbies. It appeared on Excite and Yahoo, but that's all that Google picked up. So far searches haven't turned up any instances of the Manila press release. Perhaps it's rolled off? Do Excite and Yahoo take down press releases after some time?<br><br>	The Manila press release was <a href="http://www.maccentral.com/news/9912/dec01.shtml">picked up</a> by MacCentral, the Davos one apparently, was not.<br><br>	We use the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/">PR Newswire</a> to distribute press releases.

You can also <a href="http://pikebeta.userland.com/stories/storyReader$707">open</a> the database in Pike, which is free. <br><br>	To be clear, you own your content, we have provided a mechanism for every editor to back up his or her content, and you should do it. <i>Remember Murphy. </i><br><br>	I was a regular reader of his site, and I'll miss it. He's the kind of person we want creating content with Manila.<br><br>	Postscript: Angus is staying. I'm very happy now! <i>Yeah.</i><br><br><b>How to opt-out</b><br><br>	If you want to opt-out of hosting on UserLand servers, it's your right at any time to do that. Here's how we'd like to do it.<br><br>	Place a notice on your home page saying that you have decided to move your site to another server. If possible avoid making a speech. You may want to say something about us, or our policies, and that's fine, but please do that on your new site. <br><br>	Also include the URL of your new site. We will place a redirect on the server so that your site will continue to be accessible through the older URL. Sometimes we just have to guess, based on what pointers are left on the site. <br><br>	It's better not to leave this to guesswork.<br><br>	"curly"<br><br>
