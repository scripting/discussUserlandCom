I think another reason people don't accept encryption is not that they think it's insecure, but that they've heard a lot of propaganda about how it's scary terrorist technology, and they feel it's paranoid overkill to use it. A little button that says "enable envelopes and signatures" could go a long way.</I><p>

That's definitely one more piece of psychology to overcome. A corollary to this might be that, in the final analysis, the majority of e-mail is, let's face it, pretty trivial. Why on earth should my friends encrypt and digitally sign the latest bad joke to make the rounds through e-mail? As long as the only conversation that occurs about crypto is ensuring the privacy of your e-mail, this particular propaganda piece/bit of psychology will be very hard to overcome indeed. This is why my posts on the subject tend to talk about things like idea futures markets; there are very big ideas out there that rely implicitly on the deployment of strong cryptography and digital signatures.<p>

In any event, it seems to me you've identified some further issues regarding crypto acceptance, and I appreciate the dialogue!
