Ahh... I see the light.<p>

By the same token, one could argue that the presence of Emacs would eliminate the market for extensible editors.  However, we can easily see that this is not the case.  Editors, both free and proprietary, proliferate.  It seems like every other newbie programmer wants to write an editor.  Some have gained a lot of traction.  Nedit, Pico, Jed, Vim, BBEdit, Q (is that still around?), and on and on.<p>

In light of this, doesn't your hypothesis (the GPL destroys competition) need revision?
