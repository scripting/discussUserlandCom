How big do you think the foreign aid budget is? I'd suggest doing 
some research to find out. The size of the foreign aid budget is 
something most people are prone to vastly overestimating (and 
your list of priorities below suggests you have fallen into this

Foreign aid is an investment in the future of the rest of the world
that pays dividends in greater future stability and more profitable 
opportunities for future trade."
