We entered some <i>touchy</i> areas and no one flamed out. I probably expressed the strongest opinions of anyone, and we survived. I only deleted one message, it was someone asking if they needed to withdraw a message. I sent the person a private email saying no, and thanked him for being so considerate.<p>

So, since I'm the first to complain when things get out of hand, let me offer a hearty thanks to all for helping keep things flowing smoothly and making it fun to operate this DG.
