I interviewed Craig  for the August issue of Linux Journal (p.16). He makes one key point that might help us here: open/closed and proprietary/public domain are inherently different kinds of distinctions that too often collapse along a moral axis that makes closed and proprietary both *bad* and open and public domain both *good*. To illustrate this, he plots the two sets of distinctions orthogonally and tells how the moral axis oversimplifies the whole matter. <p>

I could go on, but I'd rather let the man says for himself. I just put the piece up on my site, with his matrix, at <<a href="http://www.searls.com/burton_interview.html">http://www.searls.com/burton_interview.html</a>>.
