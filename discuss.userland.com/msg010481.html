Is it OK if I copy MSNBC's home page, run a filter that replaces all occurrences of "MSNBC" with "UserLand"? Can I then store the resulting page at www.userland.com? And what if I write an agent script that reads their home page every minute and performs this translation? Would this be OK? <p>

So, if this is not OK (clearly it's not), then where is the line? And why is it there?
