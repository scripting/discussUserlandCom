Jake is working on what we're calling "Manila-Lite/P2P" which should be an excellent model. It'll be part of Radio UserLand. <p>

The theory: Manila can be too much to start with for a casual weblogger. When you see MLP2P I think it'll provide the right feature framework for the connection to Zope.<p>

BTW, the philosophy is that everyone who has Radio UserLand should have an easy way to do a weblog. This time we're going for rock-bottom ease of use. If you want more, move up to Manila. <p>

The sites are statically served on a server of your choice. It does <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$465">upstreaming</a> of course, but it also does FTP. Maximum simplicity. Scales like nothing before.
