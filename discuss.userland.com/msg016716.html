There was a thread on <a href="http://xml.org/archives/xml-dev/">XML-DEV</a> recently about using Gnutella for distributing XML.<p>

This also falls under the category of "multicasting", and there are a lot of protocols used for that.  What you'd do is subscribe (register interest) in a channel and from then on you get notified of any changes in real-time.  IRC would probably work well too, but it doesn't scale well automatically.<p>

I've done a lot of thinking in this area if you'd like to email me.
