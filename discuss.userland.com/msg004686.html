Envious of everyone else with their own sub-domains? wish you had more than just "default" in config.mainresponder.domains?<p>

Well, you can! (Sort of, anyway.) config.mainresponder.domains won't give you "different" domains on different ports (pity!), but if you have a fixed IP address, you can have more than one domain.<p>

Make one domain entry "my.domain.com", pointing to your site table, then make another domain entry "123.456.789" (your IP dotted.id, obviously), and point that somewhere else.<p>

Viola! Two domains!<p>

Told you it was messy.
