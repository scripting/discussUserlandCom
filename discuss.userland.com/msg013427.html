That&#180;s usually done by having a DNS entry with "*" as hostname (don&#180;t know if all DNS servers support this). Then, inside the web server, you can rely on HTTP 1.1 clients (and I think any post-3.x browser) to send a Host header like "jane.domain.com" and use that to decide how to handle the request. <p>

Just an idea, don&#180;t know if it works for your needs.<p>

PS: Manila rocks, but I wouldn&#180;t know without a friend who showed me how to activate it! Maybe a big message that reads "Doubleclick Install mainResponder.ftds now!" would help very busy people getting started.
