Still, with a wee bit o' trickery, you could confine the refreshing to a small frame in the bottom, which isn't so bad.  (It can even be convinced to work in all 4+ browsers.)<p>

Unfortunately, my net connection seems shot today and while I can get at your site occaisionally, I can't seem to use it reliably.<p>

If I get my net connection back, though, I'm sure something could be put together in about half-an-hour to at least push the nastiness out of the view of the user.  You will need to change your output a bit for it to work (which shouldn't be a surprise), and it will require 4+ browsers, IE or Netscape.  However, it will require no new objects, always a plus.<p>

Alternatively, in Windows, if the user installs the XML-RPC COM object, a script might be able to use that for input, but I can't get to that site either, so I don't know if you can use it client-side.
