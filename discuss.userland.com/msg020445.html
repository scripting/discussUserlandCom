In this manner, we'd know if we've rebutted the point or not.</i>

That's easy.  You haven't rebutted <b>any</b> of his points yet; they're all valid!

Extreme points of view do tend to attract more attention.  And choosing a villain to represent a concept you want to trash is a time-honored strategy.  Labels are always good handles for propaganda.  How about "France" or "Germany"?  When you call it France and don't mention the millions of people who happen to be there trying to live their lives, it's easier to lob bombs in their direction.  The detailed discussion around intellectual property is so complicated that it gets quickly bogged down in whiteboard wordplay.  This discussion is quite like the debate of socialism vs. capitalism.  Socialism seems seductively reasonable.  People still are trying to persuade each other to either side.  The trick is to use phrases like "commie bastard".  Much easier than logic :-)
