I've got the creative-guy jitters right now.</i><p>


Creative Geeks are a rare breed. Care for them! ;-)<p>


<i>The problem with Jakob's advice, while good, is that it doesn't take into account the development process on a community site like this one. I know I'm breaking the link-rot rule, I just publicized a URL that points into a database that I plan to delete this weekend.</i><p>


I think Jakob's advice doesn't take into account database-backed websites. Databases don't speak english, they speak math. They can be taught english, but it takes work- work that many of developers won't do because thier $billion valuations won't let them take a breather.<p>


BTW- the outline-to-dotted-id scheme is cool. No, lovely. Technically aesthetic. <p>
