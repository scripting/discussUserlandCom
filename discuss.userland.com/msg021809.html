That's the way to grow. As the negativism grows, organize a positive equivalent. <p>

Provide a forum for gripes, give them a chance to be heard, and decide if there's a professional or ethical question that I need to look at. That way I could say that my ethical oversight group has not raised any issues with me, I don't have to respond to ethical challenges that haven't passed through this filter. That would free up about 50 percent of my time. I'm not kidding.<p>

Without any organization to filter these challenges, my work is totally diluted. Look at all the writing I had to do yesterday, and look at how thoughtless many of the challenges are.<p>

BTW, I would be willing to be on the oversight board for other independent Web writers. It's something we could do for each other.
