From Portland, OR  USA
Mac OS 9
Netscape Communicator v4.7 w/disk cache set to zero
U.S. Worst 256k DSL (don't know actual rate as things were cranking by to fast! :-) )
Just ran tests

Conxion 1:15<p>

Exodus  1:00 - I ran this one 3 times and each time, Communicator never thought the page completed loading.  The animation in the upper right just kept going, and going...  So this number is when I didn't see any more activity in the progess bar at the bottom of the window and I didn't hear any more disk activity.
