There isn't a built-in one, but there is a free third-party suite.
I wrote it precisely because of the usefulness (and general absence
on the web) of indices.<p>

The Indexer Suite:
<<a href="http://www.spinwardstars.com/frontier/suites/indexer.html">http://www.spinwardstars.com/frontier/suites/indexer.html</a>><p>

The Indexer Suite provides tools to build and traverse ("visit")
single & multiple-level keyword indices of anything in the ODB.
Specific scripts are provided to construct keyword indices of
web pages and of tables, and several flavors of VisitIndex script
walk an index and call user-defined callback functions.<p>

There's no tutorial (yet--I'm working on one), but there are
several sample scripts that demonstrate use of the VisitIndex
scripts.<p>
