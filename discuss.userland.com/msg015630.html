"We've had an internal project for about two weeks to redesign Weblogs.Com and to add a key new feature to the site, the ability to create your own Weblogs.Com site."<p>

Thanks to Garret Vreeland and <a href="http://mmd.weblogs.com/">Mike Donnelan</a> who are helping us figure out how to use this stuff. It's confusing, I admit it. But it's always confusing when you first jump out of the plane with no parachute. Scripting.Com regulars will remember our longtime slogan, still diggin, which might be amended now with "still haven't figured out how the parachute works." ";->"<p>

OK, so you want to get started customizing but don't know where to begin. Here's a kick out of the airplane, a <a href="http://static.userland.com/weblogsCom/misc/clueForWebloggers.html">source listing</a> of the Weblogs.Com home page. What are those funny things in curly braces? They're called macros, and when the page is rendered they invoke magic bits of Frontier code called scripts. (That's why this site is called <i>Scripting</i> News.) Those scripts poke around in the invisible object database that makes Manila work and gets things and turns them into HTML which web browsers know how to display. If you do exactly what this page does on your home page, you'll get a home page exactly like <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">ours</a>. If you change the formatting, your home page will contain the same info as ours but it will look different. This is called "customization".<p>

Andre chust arrived from Chermanee. Ve might go out for a <a href="http://www.spicynoodles.com/">Spicy Noodles</a> dinner. Andre groans. "Not so soon!". "Why not?" I asked. <i>It's even worse than it appears.</i><p>

Wow, they put a redirect on the original <a href="http://info.cern.ch/">home page</a> of the <a href="http://www.cern.ch/Public/ACHIEVEMENTS/web.html">Web</a>, the site built by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. From this page he pointed to the new sites as they came online. Unfortunately this site wasn't archived, wouldn't it be great if it were? It would be like the Bible for the Web. <i>In the beginning..</i><p>

Wait a minute, it's even heavier. They're doing something like Manila! Excellent. Tried to create a site but I'm not a member. Sad. Hey the <a href="http://webservices.web.cern.ch/webservices/General/people.htm">people</a> look pretty cool. <i>New friends?</i> <p>

This morning one DaveNet member threatened another, a newbie, who did something understandable, but not usual. (I had already sent him a private email gently explaining how it works.) The complainer wanted me to punish the person who offended him, and also rewrite the DaveNet software, and change the culture (visible To: header) because he got one piece of email he considered spam. Oy. I took him off the list with no regrets. If you send me Old Tomatoes, you're off the list, immediately. If you want to give me your pain, look in the mirror instead, and say it to yourself. You'll find a more sympathetic ear, for sure.<p>

I did a search for Old Tomatoes, thinking I'd find dozens of pages explaining what they are, but I found none. So here's the definitive graph on the subject. "Old Tomato" is a cute mis-pronunciation for "ultimatum". They don't work and they're easy to avoid. Write down your old tomato. Put it in your wallet. Read it two days from now. You'll very likely find you don't care anymore. <p>

Given this data, it's not surprising that <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$oldtomatoes.com">oldtomatoes.com</a> is not taken and neither is <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$oldtomato.com">oldtomato.com</a>. <p>

However, <a href="http://www.whatatomato.com/">whatatomato.com</a> is taken.<p>

If you like tomatoes (I don't) you'll probably like this <a href="http://www.nald.ca/clr/meals/lunchpic.htm">picture</a>.<p>
