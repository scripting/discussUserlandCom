for instance, the example that moore used (sorry, his piece is still fresh in my mind) is: what if at the grand jury they asked clinton what his golf score was this afternoon, and he said he shot an 85 (when really he shot a 104)? What if they found out he really shot a 104? Oops. He lied under oath. Let's kick him out.<p>

Another way to look at it:<p>

which is worse, Bill Clinton lying to cover up an unwise sexual liason, or George Bush proclaiming: "Read my lips: No New Taxes!!!" over and over again during his campaign... <p>

politicians lie all the time, fib all the time, make empty promises, all the time. it is the primary skill of their trade. is it worse for clinton to lie to the court and to the American public about oral sex, or worse for Bush to promise no tax hikes in order to get elected and then go back on that promise as if it were nothing?<p>

Is it worse for Ronald Reagan to "forget" (under oath) everything concerning his involvement in Iran/Contra (a matter which actually involved the possibility of LEGITIMATE and dangerous abuse of specifically PRESIDENTIAL powers, and many more legal and political ramifications)... or is it worse for Bill Clinton to hem and haw over the definition of "sexual relations"? You make the call.<p>

There are innumerable similar examples.<p>

Thanks,<p>
