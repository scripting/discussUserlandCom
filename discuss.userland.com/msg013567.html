I'm meeting with him wearing my analyst hat, to get briefed on the big picture. What is MSN? How does it relate to Yahoo, AOL, eBay, @Home, etc.<p>

After a long ship process I'm starting to take these kinds of meetings again. If any UserLand.Com members have questions they'd like raised at this meeting, post here.
