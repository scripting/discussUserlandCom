I was about to start canvasing for a Frontier developer to help me out. After discussions today, a project for which I touted Frontier will instead be done with the Microsoft suite: Front Page, ASP, and IIS. In our particular environment, I had to admit that there were good reasons for this decision.<p>

I'm just PO'd that my time spent learning UserTalk and tinkering with the mainResponder will be for naught. <p>

Can anyone comment on what I have to look forward to (or dread)?
