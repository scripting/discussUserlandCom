Here's how you do it. Add another object in your public table, make it a <struct> containing two items:<ol><p>

<li>a #content-type of text/html. <p>

<li>a <string> containing the HTML text.
</ol><p>

Make it an HTML page that contains an <object> that refers back to myJavaApp and then try referring to the HTML page with a URL.<p>

If it works, post the URL here and we can all try it out. If it doesn't (Remember Murhphy!) post the experience here.<p>

Thanks for working with me on this. It turned out to be more than a warmup project (I had a clue it might) but it's very neat and I think futuristic, but maybe not *that* futuristic.</li></li>
