It's given me food for thought:<p>

Is there a way to place some kind of categorization on the glossary, e.g. people, images, etc.  Merely from the perspective of the website, might you be able do something like the xml-based navigation thingy in mainresponder?<p>

I don't know whether this is a surface issue, i.e. having a flat structure is a good thing, just present it hierarchically, or whether there's something more fundamental here.  I know that glossaries are hierarchical, i.e. you can have a #glossary table at various levels of a website, but lower items don't bubble up.  That probably wouldn't work with this system though.<p>

Not sure where I'm going with this, but put it under the general topic of food for thought on glossary management (more like a snack, really).  I'm going to have to think about it some more.  Ideas anyone?<p>
