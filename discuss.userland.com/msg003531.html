There are solutions to this problem, too. For example, SuSE 6.0 contains a package called shlibs5 that lets users run older applications and seems to run quite well. <p>

What I find a bit strange is that none of the GNOME articles linked from Scripting News mentions <a href=http://www.kde.org>KDE</a>. From my point of view, KDE <i>is</i> the standard Linux Desktop. It has huge developer and user bases, is the standard Desktop for <a href=http://www.kde.org/kdeships.html>SuSE and other distributions</a>, has <a href=http://www.kde.org/current.html>lots of applications</a>, and since <a href=http://www.troll.no/>Qt</a> (the toolkit on which KDE is based) went open source, GNOME's main reason for existance seems to have become a bit stale.
