"Long-established, long-comfortable, long-respected interface conventions are being flouted in favor of something that looks really, really bitchin'. No matter how hard it is to use."<br><br>	I created a <a href="http://www.metababy.com/davewashere">page</a> on Metababy. Nothing much. But you can edit it. <i>Weird!</i><br><br>	<a href="http://www.warchild.nl/index.html">WarChild</a> is a Frontier website developed by Agency.Com.<br><br>	<a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20000501/pl/scotus_defamation_1.html">AP</a>: "The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling that says Internet service providers are not legally and financially liable when someone is defamed in e-mail communications or bulletin board messages." <i>Something the US does right.</i><br><br>	<a href="http://www.tomalak.org/">Tomalak has</a> lots of great music links today.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/2000/05/lastpage/">Michael Swaine</a>: "One site I often visit tends to put all the information it has about a topic right there on its front page.

You just have to turn it on. You do that on a new <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/newsItemPrefsScreen.gif">Prefs panel</a>. (And it's easy to try out, and if you don't like it, you can go back to the old way. Your archives will still work, Manila doesn't care if you switch back and forth, you can do it as many times as you want.)<br><br>	It flows. You <i>post</i> a News Item. Your Managing Editor reviews it. It's <i>released</i>. Or not. Until it's released it's <i>pending.</i><br><br>	(Of course how this works is configurable.)<br><br>	By design, it's a perfect fit for RSS 0.91. So if you're building a network out of RSS, you win. <br><br>	And get this, you can <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/newsItemsEditedInXml.gif">edit</a> News Items in XML. <br><br>	And you can <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/newsItemPikeEditing.gif">edit</a> them in Pike too. <br><br>	Mike Donellan <a href="http://inessential.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$13">asks</a> if the ability to control the appearance of News Items is "in the works". Mike, it was in the works last week. You can totally control the appearance of News Items, in the usual way, with a template. (The appearance is controllable on a site level.)<br><br>	Full docs are <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$3002">here</a>.<br><br>	A site where any member can post News Items is <a href="http://inessential.weblogs.com/">here</a>.<br><br>	If your site is hosted on a UserLand server the News Items feature is already available. Just turn it on. If you're running a Frontier server, <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1112">update</a>, and you'll get the feature too.<br><br>	<a href="http://techsupport.editthispage.com/">Seth Bokelman got</a> permission to use SlashDot icons on his Manila site (using News Items).<br><br><b>Apple pie</b><br><br>	So many email birthday greetings, so little time. BTW, I find email greetings from people I don't know to be cold and sterile, not friendly, so please don't send them, thanks. If you wish me a happy birthday, hold on to it, save it, someday I'll ask for a kindness, you can use it then.<br><br>	Today I'm 45. It just seems like yesterday that I was 12. Life rushes by so fast. I'm finally the age that profiles.userland.com says I am, and the age I would be in The Year 2000. <br><br>	One year older.
