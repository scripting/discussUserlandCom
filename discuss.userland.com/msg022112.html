Meg Whitman: "Blah blah blah one step closer build out our API, to allow third party developers to incorporate eBay's, Microsoft's extensive network of developers..." Steve Ballmer (9:21AM): "Next generation of the Internet, the XML generation, even more transforming to the user experience, faciliatating connections, people talking to people, websites talking to websites, people talking to websites. Launched dotnet in June, getting our act togethere. What would be the one company to get behind dotnet? (Hmmm. Let me guess) eBay eBay is at the top of the list. Then I got an email from Meg, let's do something pretty important and pretty strategic, a gift from the gods, we've really been working, a shared version. eBay is about community, people and businesses, and smaller businesses, shared vision, facilitate third parties putting things on eBay. End-users use Windows. Log into Windows XP, you'll be logged into eBay and any other website that wires into dotnet. The XML Generation, eBay born of the Internet, pleased and honored, we look forward to handling your questions." Meg: "Sun runs our backend. We can upgrade our front-end to Win2K so we can access the developer community better. Sun is still very much a partner on the backend." Meg: "Dotnet enables developers to create tools for eBay, those developers will be able to import the eBay market place into their content sites." <i>Dave: The services work just as well with IBM and Sun and UserLand.</i> Steve: "4 million developers." I asked my question. If this is SOAP, isn't it just as open to Sun, IBM and independent developers. Steve: "It is SOAP, which as you know, is open."<br><br><b>Good morning sports fans! <a name="goodMorningSportsFans">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/03/12#goodMorningSportsFans" title="Permanent link to 'Good morning sports fans! ' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Good morning sports fans! ' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	I love that line. It's my placeholder. By mid-morning something comes along to be my top story at least for a few hours, and off goes the sports fan greeting. <br><br>	When <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com">Garret Vreeland</a> moved his site he wrote an essay about how he was tired of living on the web to please other people. I don't know where that essay went, but the thought remained. It's the same feeling that a wife uses when divorcing a husband, or a husband divorcing a wife. But of course on the Net, as long I just express my own ideas, so what if I don't please some people? Some people are darned difficult to please! And we're not married so I don't have to go to court to get a divorce. Happiness. ";->"<br><br>	Anyway, I have a little experiment that I'd like to suggest to people who have close friends who like to explore human nature. Go for a walk, a relatively long one, with your friend. At the outset, suggest playing a game. "I'd like to ask you, sometime during this walk, why you said or did something. It may not seem significant to you, but I'd like you to answer truthfully. I will ask the question when I am sure I know the reason why you did what I saw you do, or heard you say what you said. The only reason I'm going to ask you why is to learn about myself. To find out if I'm truly omniscient or if I am projecting my own movie onto your life."<br><br>	Now, my bet is that you'll learn a tremendous amount about yourself when you do this. Your friend will say "I am doing this because xxx," and you thought it was yyy. Or maybe your friend won't even know that he or she actually did anything.<br><br>	Such an experiment can only lead to good things. You'll learn the value in asking instead of assuming you know. What makes me think of this? A conversation with a friend a few weeks ago where she commented on something I did, in fairly <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=accusatorial">accusatorial</a> way, but not terribly so, because it left room for me to explain. "I didn't do that to hurt your feelings," I said. I wasn't even thinking about her when I did it. I know this is true, because I didn't know she was involved in what I was talking about. But my friend was assuming it was about her. It was not.<br><br>	Another little story. Yesterday I was on my daily walk. I carry an orange ball with me sometimes, and throw it ahead of me, sometimes it lands in the bushes and I have to go digging around to find it. A car passed me as I was walking off the road into the bushes to look for my orange ball. "He must think I'm getting out of his way," my movie said to me. "But the joke's on him (a la Ole) I'm just going to get my orange ball." What a conversation. For all I know it was a woman driving the car, and perhaps she didn't even see me, or she was telling her kids to shut up, or driving her mother to the hospital and thinking about how she was going to pay the bills.<br><br>	The "I am the center of the universe and I know everything" bug is quite pervasive in human discourse. Compare reality to your perception and all kinds of goodness happens. <br><br>	And so we begin another week on Scripting News..<br><br>
