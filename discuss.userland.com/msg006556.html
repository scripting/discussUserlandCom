Whose head is Microsoft going to get into <i>this</i> time? Linus'? I don't know if it's possible. Which is ironic, since Linus has effectively offered what's in his head to anyone who asks. <p>

I think Microsoft is something like the sheister who can't deal with it when they meet with someone who's on the level- they're always looking for the other person's "angle".<p>
