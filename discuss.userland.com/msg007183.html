I was looking for the story on Sun Tzu's book, and  where I had to click somewhere else, maybe even several clicks, to get to the actual story. If I had a suspicious mind, I'd think this seems like it could be a device to drive traffic and build pageviews rather than use the power of RDF to do news stories right. However today I am suspicion free, and perhaps it is jusdt a mistake.
