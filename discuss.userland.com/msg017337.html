We'll have to agree to disagree. We cannot <I>completely</I> absolve people of responsibility for their actions. It's legitimate to ask why someone would do something as colossally stupid as running a database--something that takes in code, runs code, manipulates files, etc.--with the permissions on the system that make the entire system available, no holds barred, a single "rm -rf *" will wipe out every mounted filesystem, etc. etc. etc.<p>

It's also legitimate to ask why someone would do something as colossally stupid as walking down a dangerous street at night. Our society has moved <I>far</I> too far away from holding individuals responsible for their own actions and insisting that they think for themselves. If the person is mugged, we should obviously prosecute the mugger. :-) But then we should ask the victim "What were you <I>thinking</I>?"
