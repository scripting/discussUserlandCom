Most Zoomworld stuff is discussed in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/104-9759808-0029538">The Humane Interface</a>. So far as I know, Zoomworld is a vision, not a product. Would love to hear more from those who know more.<p>

I wish there were more convergence between Pike and what I would term "spatial (or visual) outliners" like Zoomworld or <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Storyspace.html">Storyspace</a>.<p>
