There is a transport group, consisting of two people. Perhaps you can e-mail one of them and ask how they would prefer it be presented?<p>

Or you can e-mail Tim for advice. Though after reading his book one would rather have one's nails ripped out than try working with the IETF. :)<p>

Also, after reading his book, it would seem that making the publishing of web pages easier is something v important to him. Perhaps he would be willing to offer advice and help in how best to work with the IETF?<p>

Wouldn't hurt. (I realise that making it easier to publish by wiring up an editor to a server is just one of the potential uses of XML-RPC.)
