Hmm... my memory told me that such a call existed, but glancing through the specs, there isn't such a thing.  One substitute would be to create a new discussion group message with <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaRpc/stories/storyReader$41">manila.discuss.message.create</a> and then to set that to the homepage with <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaRpc/stories/storyReader$79">manila.homepage.set</a>.<p>

I don't know if that method would exactly mimic what "Flip Home Page" accomplishes or not.  But it's worth a shot, perhaps.<p>
