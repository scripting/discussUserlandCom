Tell me more. I love to hear about that..<p>

Aside from that, this is too close to a conflict of interest, an essay by me saying "I want to make money" would be a hard one to write. <p>

Tim and I don't get along. We're like oil and vinegar. We've tried, for years, and we always get into flamewars. If he's going to lend a hand, it's got be without me in the loop.  <p>

Michael Miller is a friend, for many years. Bill Joy and I have never had a conversation. I didn't like a lot of the BS about Java. I basically don't think he's honest. I know a lot of people listen to him, but I don't want his support, I'm not enough of a mercenary. <p>

Thanks for the encouragement. I bet a lot of people don't know we used to work together in the 80s. It's nice to loop back around to that again. Let's see what we can do.<p>

In the meantime I'm getting psyched for tomorrow's in-my-face flamefest at Seybold. I hear people are already sharpening their knives! ";->"
