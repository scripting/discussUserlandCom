Although I think his original idea was to make the Web Browser the primary tool in this effort, it sounds like he would be a big proponent of the "Edit this Page" functionality of Frontier.<P>
Tim Berners-Lee also takes the time to mention XML and RDF in this book, which makes it interesting at some levels to people that read this site.<P>
<A HREF="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/09/20/1642241&mode=thread">A Jon Katz review</A> of the book, with extensive feedback from the Open Source community, is published on <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A>.  FWIW, I made some comments as to the ponderousness of portions of the book.  But, some weblog development and scripting fans will find portions of it useful.<BR></p></p>
