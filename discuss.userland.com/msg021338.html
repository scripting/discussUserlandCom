His intent in posting the document was similar to yours (to solicit feedback), but he explicitely made the resulting document non-proprietary.<p>

On the other hand, he has a rather different attitude towards the discussion of compensation.<p>

Interestingly, he hopes that an open-source "employee handbook generator" will be one of the results of his document and the resulting discussion.<p>

Do you think that an open-source "compensation scheme generator" is feasible?
