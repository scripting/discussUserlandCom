Yeah--I noticed a bunch of redraw bugs, most of which appeared to be connected to the canvas's block-by-block update handling. Nautilus' asynchronous updating gets awkward on big directories, too.<p>

But given who works for Eazel, I suspect they know all about these issues.<p>

I tend to apply very different standards to 0.1 and 1.0 software. Nautilus is promising, but not ready for prime time.<p>
