One for searching (memory++), one for static serving (apache/iis/whatever) + the rest for dynamic content.<p>

Penguin computing, <a href="http://www.penguincomputing.com">http://www.penguincomputing.com</a> has some linux ones, ~ 400mhz celeron + 64mb of memory + 1u (1.75" tall) rack case + 8.9 gig drive, cdrom and built in ethernet (10/100).  Granted these are linux, but I'd bet that you'd be able to find something similar in the nt domain.<p>

Their base system is $1500, I'd add some memory, depending on the application. (i.e. frontier search engine == lotsa memory, straight pages like the discussion group == more processing.) A rack mount servers go, this is pretty reasonable pricing. (As an aside, the rack case is probably at least half as expensive as an emachines tower.)<p>

Maybe top it off with a network switch (~ $200/port or so) so that each machine gets its 100mbit each way to itself.<p>

This setup should saturate most reasonable upstream bandwidth availability.<p>

If rack mounts are not necessary, at work we just got in a power 2 it dude! tower with dual celeron 400's, overclockable to 504. Good ultradma drive + 256 megs of memory, 11 fans, and 16mb video card for ~$1700. I don't think I'd overclock a server unless it went through a good shakedown eval first, but the dual processors are always a nice option. <p>
