Dave, you should see if they will support xml-rpc.  Looks like it is built on top of starbase.  Perhaps there'll be a way to interface with Frontier and other xml-rpc enabled apps.<p>

Project Whirlwind<p>

               Content management has become an arduous task, with Web sites evolving to meet the needs of e-commerce and e-business. Built on advanced technology licensed from Starbase, Macromedia's Project Whirlwind will be introduced to market next year. It will be a complete site production platform that enables content contribution, production management, content management, verification, and deployment. Users will be able to submit content, collaborate with others across the company, and control the delivery of information. With its open architecture, Project Whirlwind will work with existing enterprise infrastructures and will be able to handle dynamic content. It will also be tightly integrated with leading front-end Macromedia Web authoring solutions. <p>
