(I am in the LA area).
I have 2 computers; one is a PC and the other is a
Macintosh. Despite what it says on their website (<a href="http://www.gte.com/dsl/idsl/sysreqmt.html">http://www.gte.com/dsl/idsl/sysreqmt.html</a>), the
salespeople say that they do not support Macintosh.<p>

I am hoping that I can have them install and
configure for the PC and then use my Mac.<p>

As I understand it, there are 2 installations;
First, they come and install an RJ-45 jack in
the wall of your house.
Second, they plug the DSL modem into the jack,
install the ethernet card in your computer, and
configure the settings on your computer.<p>

Is this correct? 
Could you tell me what kind of DSL modem they
gave you and how it works (i.e. does it have an
ethernet jack to go to your computer and a phone
jack?). Do you have a fixed IP or dynamic IP
address?
