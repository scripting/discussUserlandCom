    We could add email notification to the XML-RPC DG.<p>

I guess I'm a bit confused.  I visit <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">http://www.xmlrpc.com/</a> and it
directs me to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$947">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$947</a> which looks
like an anchor message for XML-RPC in a larger discussion group.  I
then jump to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/topics">http://discuss.userland.com/topics</a> and see lots of
topics, many of which don't appear to be related to XML-RPC.<p>

If I sign up for email notification, what will I get in my email:<p>

    1. copies of the XML-RPC postings<p>

    2. copies of all discuss.userland.com postings<p>

    3. pointers to one or the other of the above postings<p>

?  Will I be able to send email messages from my fave editor and have
them show up as postings in one or another UserLand discussion group?
Does more than one discussion group actually exist?<p>

I use XML-RPC from Python and support it for our application from
both Perl and Java.  I'm sure all the other stuff that is on
the discussion group is valuable in the correct context, but my
context doesn't overlap much with Frontier or other UserLand
activities except at the XML-RPC interface.<p>

I think the lack of an XML-RPC mailing list (or at least a group of
some kind that could be gatewayed to/from email) hurts the XML-RPC
community.  It's a fine piece of work, and I think there are probably
a lot more people who use it than traffic on this discussion group
would suggest.  The discussion-group-only format hurts several ways.<p>

    1. By being mixed in with other UserLand/Frontier discussions,
    its visibility is diluted.<p>

    2. The less focused nature of the discussion group reduces the
    chances that someone like myself will participate actively.<p>

    3. Having to visit the web site to follow topics or post messages
    also reduces my participation.  I don't have the time or 
    inclination to visit a web site on a regular basis to read what is
    effectively email.  I really want email.<p>

    4. I'm not sure what other other people have for message editors,
    but Netscape's <textarea> widget (at least as it exists on the
    Unix flavor of the browser) really sucks compared to a decent
    text editor (take your pick).<p>

    5. There's no ability to CC or BCC other people or other lists,
    nor can I create file copies of my posts for later reference.<p>

    6. If I can't follow the discussion group for awhile, I come back
    and have to wade through a huge sea of posts looking for the old
    XML-RPC content.  My email software will just quietly toss those
    messages into the correct mailbox, where they will sit patiently
    for the latest storm to subside so I can read them.<p>

Sorry to pop in like this.  I haven't visited the discussion group
for several months (for all the reasons stated above), but the topic
keeps resurfacing on my frontal lobe every couple of weeks. I'd like
to interact with other people using or interested in XML-RPC. Email
just seems like a much better medium for this stuff.<p>
