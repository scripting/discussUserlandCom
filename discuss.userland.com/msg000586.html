BTW, if Microsoft or Netscape people are listening, feel free to implement these ideas.<p>

Here's another one. I'd like to be able to load the menu bar of the browser application with a set of bookmarks. A contextual menu, that goes with the web page. To see the need, look at the top of the page on this site. I want to fill that out with lots of commands. But because I don't get a menu bar to play with, it's going to be confusing and cluttered before I get started.<p>

The key idea here is to leverage the base of developers who know how to design user interfaces in a graphic environment. Read Tog's piece, I pointed to it last week. We threw out all the good ideas when we went to the web. Now let's pick up the pieces.<p>
