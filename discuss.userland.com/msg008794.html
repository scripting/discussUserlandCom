Why limit the audience for a trailer? If more people see a trailer, presumably more people will want to see the movie. Universal then makes more money.<p>

Movie-List isn't making copies of the trailers. Universal still gets to see how many people are viewing each trailer by counting their hits. <p>

Movie-List is giving them free publicity. <p>

I don't see the problem.<p>
