I had an insight into that today. I'm afraid, like many others of the unknown nature of death. Then I realized that's bullshit. I'm more afraid of tomorrow. I have no idea what will happen then, any more than I have an idea of what happens after death. Why do I <i>think</i> I know what will happen tomorrow? By extrapolation, by looking to the past, and using it to predict tomorrow. But here's the bug. I'm using my perception of the past to lull me into believing I understand the future, right up to the point of my death, after which I have no idea what happens. But! There is no such thing as the past. Now you say, oh what bullshit <i>that</i> is. "Of course there's a past," you say. But can you touch it? Can you in any way experience it? How do you know it exists? And if you think it does, tell a story about an event that happened in the past to someone else who was there. Why does their account of what happened differ from yours? If it could be appreciated, at a scientific level, then wouldn't you tell the same story? (And of course I'm not really afraid of tomorrow, that's just an excuse for not paying attention to now.)<br><br><b>Early morning stuff<a name="earlyMorningStuff">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/03/01#earlyMorningStuff" title="Permanent link to 'Early morning stuff' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Early morning stuff' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	Good morning sports fans!<br><br>	Happy March. Where is the year going?<br><br>	First there was B2B, then B2C, then P2P, then P2P2P2P..<br><br>	Today I'm working on M2B. ";->"<br><br>	Hint: The B in M2B is <a href="http://www.scripting.com/blog/index.html">Blog</a>.<br><br>	Another clue is just a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/clueOfTheDayMarch1.gif">click</a> away.<br><br>	Question: Can Word send email? If so how does it format the output? Do you get plain text? That would be a godsend. We could do some serious stuff with that. (Postscript, Word *does* send email. Wow. Have to investigate. Apparently it only sends it in RTF. Oooops.)<br><br>	Random thought. If platform is Chinese household, to have happy house, respect must go both ways. Husband must buy flowers for wives, and wives must not try to change husband.<br><br>	Another random thought. To people who say Blogs are nothing new, right on. What's really going on? Web writing software is maturing, getting easier and more accessible. It's the natural progression of technology. Refinement and ease of use. Once, a long time ago, we were confused about what the Web did. As we got less confused, we could narrow the functionality, make easier to use software, and bring new waves of people on board. The software industry merged with the Internet community in the mid-90s. That's all that happened. (I guess that was a lot though.)<br><br>	"brain"<br><br>
