MS and Intel did not want this to happen . They were against stand alone devices which did not require a computer to operate. They came up with the Home API, <a href="http://www.homeapi.org/">http://www.homeapi.org/</a>. This effort required a computer as the hub. It looks like this effort has moved towards a universal plug and pray, which is now allows for peer to peer transfers. And low and behold, Sony signed on.<p>

The HAVI spec <a href="http://www.havi.org/home.html">http://www.havi.org/home.html</a> is more about stand alone consmer devices communicating. It's about simplicity. Simple connections. In this spec, you can plug a bunch of home theater devices together. you would have a stand alone scanner, which could send the item to your color photo printer. You could take a snapsoft from your digtial camcorder.<p>

Only problem is the none of this IS NOW. Consumers are against paying a lot. Which may be why we don't see any devices and only specs.
