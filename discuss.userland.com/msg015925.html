The cardinal rule in such a situation that I learned the hard way is <i>suspect everything!</i>. On the 0.001% off chance that you haven't already tried this, you might check that your something in <i>your network</i> (e.g. your router) is not at fault, for example by running the Pacbell-tracker script against a web site running on another machine on your subnet. Also, if the routers have their own IP addresses (mine do) then you might ping them to see if your router or the router at the other end of the Pacbell T1 is up all the time.<p>
