I'd love to read something that raises that question, though, if it exists.<p>

(Think of it this way -- there are analogs to Napster that allow sharing <b>any</b> file, not just music.  Is it legal for me to make available my copy of Frontier using these?)<p>

Napster doesn't "play music over the Internet."  It provides the mechanism behind a searchable distributed database from which people can download music over the Internet.<p>

As a user, the two are remarkably <b>different</b> as well.  I can't go to KFOG, choose the music I want to listen to, and download it so that I can listen to it at my leisure, record it to CDs, give it to friends, etc., all 100% free of royalties to the artists who created the works -- it's a radio station, I have no control over their playlist (absent the occasional request), and they write a pretty hefty check to ASCAP and the artists every month.
