I took notes for a Japanese class using the Newton's built-in outliner, then used a package called "NewtScape" (a web browser with lots of extra features) to convert the outline to HTML. From there, I uploaded the HTML to my Mac and put it into Frontier, but if I wanted to I could have ftp'd it directly from my Newton to my web server.<p>

You can see the converted notes at <<a href="http://www.orange-road.com/japanese/">http://www.orange-road.com/japanese/</a>>.
