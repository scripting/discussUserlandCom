Much progress on <a href="http://my.userland.com/">My.UserLand.Com</a>. You can now choose your news. Some interesting channels <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$18">there</a>. More are on the way? <a href="http://my.netscape.com/publish/help/quickstart.html">RSS</a> is a good start at a syndication format. Grass roots and blades popping thru the earth.

Arnold Lesikar: <a href="http://einstein.stcloudstate.edu/booleanExtension/">The Boolean search extension</a> extends the capability of the Userland search engine. In a search you can now specify words to be excluded as well as words to be required on a page. Other keywords can be optional. In short this extension makes the Userland search engine function more like one of the major Web search engines. <p>
