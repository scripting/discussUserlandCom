I wonder if enough votes could have been obtained in Mr. Nixons case under that rule.<p>

Articles of impeachment require one half plus one members of the House to vote for articles of impeachment to insure that the charge is serious.  Requiring more would be like requiring a citizen to pay say $1 million dollars filing fee to file a legal suit.  It
would place the ability to seek restitution for a perceived injustice out of reach for most of us.<p>

Being "charged" for an impeachable offense is serious, but like an individual being sued, until the "trial" has been heard, and a verdict is rendered, it is mearly a charge.  The Senate has the option of doing nothing about the charges, exercising a lesser punishment, such as sensure, or conducting a complete hearing (trial).  There is takes a two thirds majority, and rightly so.<p>

We have a good system.  Let it work.
