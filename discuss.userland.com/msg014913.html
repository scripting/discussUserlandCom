with the help of the frontier xml examples, i was able to import the ODP samples into a frontier table and enumerate through the nodes.<p>

however, i'm wondering a few things:<p>

1) has anyone imported the entire ODP RDF into frontier. if so, did it work, is it well formed, any tips, sample code, advice?
2) also, has anyone worked with large database in frontier (300+ MB). if so, how is performance><p>

thanks<p>
