If the paying customers put up with the RIAA's actions, then we deserve what we get. But I don't intend to do that. I intend to avoid purchasing CDs from RIAA member companies until they stop putting obstacles in the way of convenient access to music over the internet.<p>

The next question is -- how can I find companies that don't participate in that effort and reward them?
