Gnutella and Freenet(not quite so much Napster) quite frankly break the whole TCP/IP purpose.  They basicly span a whole range of port numbers, can choose them at random, and can pipe through known port numbers to serve non-standard content.  Thier whole purpose is to be HARD to administer(therefore hard to restrict).  I can understand thier desires, but as a Network admin I find these programs to be EVIL.  They remove MY control of MY network.<p>

OK... I am done ranting. :-)
