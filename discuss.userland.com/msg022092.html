There will be. First there was one. There will be two, for sure, we're finishing ours now, it's called Radio. And then everyone else will know how to do it too.<br><br>	Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/">platform</a> has every programming language known to man, and a few more. Ours has <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1119">one</a>. Theirs works with SQL databases. Ours has a built-in object database. Theirs doesn't have a Web content management system. Ours does. Theirs doesn't run on the Mac. Ours does. Theirs comes from Microsoft, ours does not.<br><br>	Of course <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> is a Dot-Net. Look at all the languages they have running in Java. It talks to SQL databases. It kind of runs on a Mac. It also does not come from Microsoft. <br><br>	<a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> is a Dot-Net too. Two languages at last count. An object database, a Web interface. Open source.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/">Here's</a> <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">what</a> all Dot-Nets have in common. <br><br>	It's called interop, and <a href="http://validator.soapware.org/">we</a> <a href="http://validator.xmlrpc.com/">mean</a> it. In May or June, Murphy-willing, we'll have an interop event. Here's how it's going to work. A call for presentations with a twist. No single presenters. You have to have a date. Your date works at a different company. You can boast about your product, no problem there, but you also have to boast about your date's product. And you have to demo interop. You can have as many dates as you want. Awards will be given based on how interesting your interop is. Awards will be given also for lack of lock-in. Awards will be given for big companies supporting little ones. Awards will also be given for little companies working with little companies (a rare, precious thing). There will be scholarships for small developers and open source projects. <br><br>	We now have a slogan. <i>"Interop till you drop."</i><br><br>	The evening movie will be <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/redirect/leaf=switch/from=sr-1297169/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=967339">They Shoot Horses Don't They?</a><br><br>	Working name for the conference: Interopathon.<br><br><b>Specialization<a name="specialization">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/02/22#specialization" title="Permanent link to 'Specialization' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Specialization' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://inessential.com/2001/02/22.html">Brent</a>: "I was watching on TV a cheetah standing in the middle of a giant herd of something -- not gazelles, something a little larger. They weren't afraid of the cheetah at all. They knew. The cheetah was looking around at all these animals, in the middle of literally tons and tons of meat, but there was nothing he could do. A lion would have had a field day, but the cheetah just looks around, hungry."<br><br><b>Napster<a name="napster">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/02/22#napster" title="Permanent link to 'Napster' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Napster' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	Last night's <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/02/21/ohhhNapster">DaveNet</a> got quite a response, including one from Napster CEO Hank Barry. He said "I wish it were this simple. It is not." To which I responded "Hank, it <i>is</i> that simple."<br><br>
