It's tricky, and you'll have to do some digging, but it should be do-able.<p>

You can run Frontier as a pre-processor. (See your WebSTAR documentation if you're unfamiliar with pre-processors.) If Frontier is a pre-processor, it gets called for every single request. If Frontier returns a page (with headers), then WebSTAR returns that to the client, rather than processing the request as it normally would.<p>

If Frontier returns "", then WebSTAR processes the request normally. If you're running Nirvana, then Frontier will handle every request, and won't ever return "".<p>

I realize that a HowTo would be helpful, and it's on my list, but I probably won't get to it until later this week at the earliest.
