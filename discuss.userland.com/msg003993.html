Competition means improvement.<p>

There are bound to be other contenders in the future.   (I don't see people using mice & overlapping windowed displays on Star Trek, for example...)<p>

The major problem from a user's perspective, is to be able to sit at any strange workstation and get things done immediately, regardless of what strange, customized environment is being used.<p>

If one could merely enter an address where one's "preference file" could be downloaded and then made active (e.g. switching to KDE, changing colours, whatever...), then any desktop can be called home.<p>

That mechanism should be made a standard, not the desktop environment.<p>
