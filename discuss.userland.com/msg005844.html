I don't agree. BTW, if what you say is true, I never heard anyone from Apple or any of the other OpenDoc companies say anything like that. A new platform needs shameless evangelism. An effective arm-twister. That's another clue when you look at supporting new platforms. Do they get out the kneepads and beg for software?<p>
