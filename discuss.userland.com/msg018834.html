ie: 
- defining and tracking budget, deliverables, responsibilities, timelines <p>
- localisation issues (tracking which pages/sections have been translated or localised)<p>
- defining inheritance of attributes within a site section<p>
- enabling exchange of data among project management, content creation (Dreamweaver) and content management (Frontier/Manila)<p>
- setting markers and checkboxes to track what pages/sections have been completed and reviewed. Etc etc <p> 
My questions are:  <p>
Will Macromedia's Whirlwind address these issues?<p>
Has it been done by anyone else?<p>
Is it worth doing?<p>
If noone's done it is there any interest in starting work on a standard?
