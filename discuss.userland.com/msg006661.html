if you're trying to get a nested outline of pages I found simply writing out the links as an outline and then rendering that into the template to be the easiest way. unless, of course, you're dealing with a whole pile of pages that changes all the time!<p>

if you're trying to get a 'siteliner-esque' pop-out nested navbar, you could try writing an outline and then rendering it through a renderer that only displays the links you want.<p>

this is what I'm <i>trying</i> to do at the moment.<p>

basic logic: look at the line of the outline. if it is a link to <i>this page or the level above</i>, write it out, if not, don't. rinse and repeat.<p>

sounds simple, doesn't it? I'm still trying!
