1) IE - Access Issue: The first one is that IE will open an Access DB attachment if called from within a web page.  It incorrectly prompts you about opening the document after it has already opened the DB and executed the script.  <p>


This hole can be closed by changing the security settings within Access<p>


2) IE - Office Issue: The second one is that IE can cause excel or powerpoint to save a file in any embedded scripts in any location that the user reading the email has write access to.  This includes things like the startup directory.<p>


This hole can be closed by updating office with patches.<p>


I personally think that if the user only has write access to non-system directories that will also minimize the risk, but this approach is much harder to setup and maintain. ( I have a secured NT setup in my office with a huge amount of access control limits set for each and every user and directory.  It was a large effort to setup and its security is only as good as my ability to explicitly limit access to important directories.  I would not reccommend this approach, I setup this system to experiment with NT access controls and compare them to Unix.  I am much more comfortable with my efforts to harden and lock down my Unix systems)<p>


To directly answer your questions, I think that removing office would close these holes, but I think changing the default security settings in Access and patching the rest of Office would close these holes as well.<p>


Note: I am not a Windows security expert.  I have a large amount of experience playing with NT and Win2K security, but I do not consider myself an expert in this area.  I am much more comfortable with Unix, Macintosh and network security issues.<p>
