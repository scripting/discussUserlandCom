Whether or not you like it, people are going to release code under the GPL but guess what..  You can route around them very easily.  <p>

Yesterday, the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta</a> project released a new code base, <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">Velocity</a>.  It is a replacement of <a href="http://www.webmacro">WebMacro</a>, a Java-templating system.  It is also released under the Apache/BSD license.  WM was released under the GPL and couldn't be released with things like <a href="http://java.apache.org/turbine">Turbine</a>.  <p>

Developers can use this without reservations.<p>
