Your tester truncates, (which is what Netscape's should do too!), but I was having trouble navigating through all the twisty JavaScript and unresponsive servers to get my MyNetscape account set up this morning, so used your validator (thank you!) to double-check my XML and came to work where I could fix the registration problem on a fast net connection, and never noticed that my script puts too many entries in the RDF file. So I've got to wait 'til I get home to fix it.<p>

No biggie, but since you're truncating anyway you're obviously keeping track of this number and it might be worth adding an extra message next time you're in that code.<p>

Thanks for the tool!
