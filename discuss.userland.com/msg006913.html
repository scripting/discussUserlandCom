I recently changed jobs, and the e-mail address that my Userland membership is stored under is no longer correct.  However, I didn't see a way, in the prefs, to change that.<p>

This has been the case for a while, but until this new bulletin via e-mail feature, it didn't matter.<p>

Hopefully I won't have to create a new user id and re-enter everything!<p>

Thanks,
Chris Grayson
