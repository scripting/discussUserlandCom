Single window mode? Not mandatory - you can have multiple windows, rendered in the standard Apple style. Either way, we are bringing in newbies and old NeXT people, and should accomodate their working styles as well.<p>

Inactive controls are indeed rendered as being inactive - ie. they lose their color. Only when you mouse over an inactive control does it become active, which DOES make sense - I like the ability to manipulate inactive windows without bringing them into view.<p>

The main complaint people seem to have about the controls is that they may cause problems with color blind people. As a color blind person myself, I can state that it won't be a problem. Most of the people complaining, oddly enough, aren't even colorblind. I mean, what is so inherantly intuitive about current widgets anyhow? Since when is a plain square symbolic for 'close window'? These are learned.<p>

As for the apple logo in the middle of the menu bar, I couldn't agree more. I hope Apple will wise up on this issue.<p>

The application menu seems to be gone, or at the least not yet implemented. I do think Apple might be trying to deemphasize the difference between 'running' and 'not running' applications, moving to a more document-centric view of things. With a modern sub-system, there is no reason to quit applications. When an app isn't used for a while, its memory is swapped out to disk until it's needed again. This will take a while to get used to, but it's more natural from a user perspective in the end.<p>

This last note is something you should think about - it's a big paradigm (uh oh, there's that word) change, but it's a natural next step.<p>

...<p>

There are some other good things about the new interface, though. I personally like the dock, although it could do with some improvements.<p>

Also, the drop-shadow underneath windows is far more than fluff in my opinion. I believe it greatly improves the distinction between active and inactive windows, and have been asking for this feature in the BeOS for 2 years. It's a proper use of 3d metaphors without losing the familiarity of a 2d interface. Actually, I really really like this.<p>

Tying save/open dialog boxes to windows makes so much sense, it's not even funny.<p>

There have been rumors that Apple has been experimenting with a hotkey combo which makes the current window VERY tranclucent when a key is held down and you move your mouse over it. I really hope this ends up in the final release. It would make desktop visualization much nicer for those of us with multiple windows open.<p>

Anyhow, I agree that there are some implementation details that could use some work. But not so many that I'd register a domain name to point them out. It's still in early rev of the OS... :>
