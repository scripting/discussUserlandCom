(The 'P' in OPML is in fact what checked my initial (no pun intended) impulse to post feedback on OPML.  Processing.  Hmmm.  What do you mean?)<p>

<blockquote>
The purpose of this format is to provide a way to exchange information between outliners and Internet services that can be browsed or controlled through an outliner.

Is this an outline defintion format, i.e. a client uses OPML in conjunction w/ someform of RPC to create outlines on the remote host?<p>

Is this an outline presentation format, i.e. a client uses OPML data obtained from a hierarchical host to present the remote data structure?<p>

Both? (My reading of above from spec. would suggest:  Definitely yes, but I am not sure.)<p>

In regards to extensibility:<p>

Is this format intended to be used specifically w/ UserLand/Frontier outlines or do you envision its use w/ other hierarchical system?<p>

Thanks.
