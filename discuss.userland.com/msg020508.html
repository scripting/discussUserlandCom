attribute name.</i><p>

That's very good, I love hearing about tuples, sets, and operators.  Given that definition, I would only ask whether the NamespaceURI part is ever implied by context, rather than stated explicitly?<p>

If the namespace is ever implied, presumably this is across some scope. Is there a nice definition for such scopes, and are they lexical?  Inside a scope where a namespace is implied, all all symbols so implicitly scoped, or do some symbols escape the qualification?<p>

Ken: <i><blockquote><code><br>
dc = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"<p>

                   doc.title<br>
                   doc.description<br>
                   doc.(dc, 'source')</code></blockquote><p>

               Here, the object doc has had a new set of attributes "mixed-in" to it (from the Dublin Core in this example). The new
               attributes are distinguished from the originals by fully qualifying the tuple used as accessors.</i><p>

That's a good example and looks clear.  What default namespace qualifies the symbols 'title' and 'description' above?<p>

Ken: <i>It's not clear to me that there's any ambiguity there, can you shed more light on that?</i><p>

The example looks like code in some language I assume is not XML.  Often code in procedural languages is less ambiguous than encodings in declarative languages.  Normally I think of XML as primarily declarative in use (though folks could also use it procedurally, I know).<p>

So my question would be this.  Is XML syntax less clear than the example about when an explicit namespace is used for qualification?
