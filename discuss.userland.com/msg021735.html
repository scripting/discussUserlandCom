Why not borrow a technique that has served Java very very well, the hierarchical namespace?<p>

If I make some new node-types, i could call them:<p>

type="com.roepcke.ftp.Server"<p>

type="com.roepcke.ftp.Folder"<p>

type="com.roepcke.ftp.File"<p>

type="com.roepcke.imap.Message"<p>

The nice thing is, this actually works right now, and doesn't need a central registry.  The hierarchy is optional of course, so type="link" and type="song" would still work, it wouldn't HAVE to be changed to com.userland.radio.link and com.userland.radio.song.<p>

No XML namespaces needed, no registry, no collisions. (not that I'm saying they're a bad thing, I don't really know)<p>
