No surprise, Microsoft swarmed. That's what I wanted. They want to know where I want to go. My first response was to fix the bugs in textareas, and I would get my thoughts together for the next step. So here's a <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$4329">message</a> that's headed in that direction. I sent it via email to Julian Jiggins, a program manager on the MSIE team and Michael Winser, a MSIE programmer, and a frequent contributor on our DG.<p>

<a href="http://developers.userland.com/WebEdit">WebEdit</a> for Frontier 6 is available. We're going to let people who are serious WebEdit users have it now, and we'll release it thru the updates process after the remainder of Frontier 6 ships. People may need time to plan for this part of the upgrade, because it involves upgrading groups of team members.<p>

The neatest new feature in MSIE5 is the <a href="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/radiobar.gif">radio bar</a>. I've not been able to listen to the radio while I work because my computers interfere with reception. Last night I was able to listen to Larry King interviewing Monica Lewinsky's father and stepmother while I read the fascinating email that came in response to yesterday's piece. <i>It helps to be at the end of a T1 line.</i><p>

My least favorite MSIE5 bug. The Back button goes dim at inopportune random times. It forgets how you got here. It's happened five times today. Thankfully the Home button works.<p>

Interesting side-effect of the MSIE5 shipment. It's been hard to get thru to our California servers because our ISP is Conxion. 999 days out of a 1000 this is a good deal, our pipe is extra-wide because we share that pipe with Microsoft's US download site, which is also hosted by Conxion. But when a new version of MSIE is released our sites get slow.<p>
