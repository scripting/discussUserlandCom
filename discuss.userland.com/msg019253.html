Ah, but it's the greatest CD-to-mp3 ripper for windows.<p>

Drop a CD into your new dell, watch MusicMatch look up the title and tracks, then customize your recorder settings and then hit record. With a fast (>700Mhz) machine, an entire CD can be ripped to mp3 in about 5-7 minutes, with custom naming, categorization on your hard drive, and at custom Kbps quality. It's a thing of beauty. <p>

If you want to stop it from being your default mp3 player, just change your associations for .mp3. Hold down the shift key and right click an mp3 file. Click <b>Open with...</b> then pick a program and check the "Always use this program with these files" box.
