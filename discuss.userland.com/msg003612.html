Once the original outline has been downloaded, meeting members can connect every 5 seconds, but only to get a "lastModified" javascript variable sent to an invisible Layer or frame or whatever.  If it's been modified, it calls for more details, which are again invisible and minimal in terms of whether something moved, or was added or deleted.  As long as all parts of an outline have references, only the change can be sent, and the outline rebuilt on the client end.<p>
