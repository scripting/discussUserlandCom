I think we're close at least...<p>

There are some interface issues, some MR issues*, some beta server* issues,  and some "Eric really needs caffeine before doing technical support" issues (Sorry Phil). <p>

One quick question though, If I'm relying on [prefs.root].prefsSuite, should I make people download it from the sample code page, or can I throw it through my root update process? (Technical I can handle, it's copyright, how you feel, and distributing old code that I'm more worried about)<p>

* to be addressed in another forum, and after I make one more hack through the code to make sure that I'm not off in the weeds somewhere.<p>
