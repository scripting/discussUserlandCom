Maybe I felt a bit more by some commercial software that imposes dependicies (do you know what I am talking about?) but not by Open Source.<p>

Anyway, straight logic is necessary to make a good programmer.<p>

If my logic was twisted, it would "predate" my work quality and the money I make from it. <p>

If it would be really twisted... I might even think that my problems were due to the practices of M$, GNU, the Alien Consortion For IT World Domination or whatever.<p>


Have fun,
Paulo
