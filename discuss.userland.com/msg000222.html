The regex working group happily provide you with the following snippet to cut down on proliferating "Re: "'s in the subject line.<p>

In the newMessageForm (in the #tools table) change<p>

local (subject = "Re: "   pta^.messages^.[string.padwithzeros (inreplyto, 5)].subject)<p>

to<p>

 local (subject = pta^.messages^.[string.padwithzeros (inreplyto, 5)].subject)<p>

regex.subst( "^(re: )*(.*)", "Re: \\2", @subject )<p>

You should do it also in getMessageSubject script - but that script doesn't seem to do anything.<p>

I couldn't find any other instances where you were adding a  "Re: " to a subject line.<p>

Of course, you're free to ignore this message, and do the subject anyway you want :-)<p>

Since discussionGroup.root is (presumably) example code - it also may not be wise to include a call to an extension like regex.<p>

Cheers,
Christopher
