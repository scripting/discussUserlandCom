I read Ries&Trout 6 years ago and have been wondering ever since: if the book is right, how come line extensions are so commonplace ?<p>

My conclusion: they don't necessarily "blur" the leader's position. After observing myself and others, I think people mostly react to things like the red Fanta by happily ignoring them.<p>

This works well with Amazon. If you think of it as a bookstore, you can use it as a bookstore with little or no extra hassle.<p>

To say, "I abandoned them because they commited the Line Extension sin" sounds like "I won't talk to you because you drink red Fanta." Line extension isn't a sin as long as it doesn't interfere with the consumer. To say, "I won't talkt to you because you make me drink red Fanta," would be different. That would be a sin. I don't feel 
that way at Amazon, though.
