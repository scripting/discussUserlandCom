It's more a case that I prefer using MacOS, and since Apple is the only company providing the OS, thats where I look to for improvements in the operating system. </i><p>

I'm glad I asked the question. Key point, Apple is the only company providing the OS. As long as that's true, *both* our investments in the Mac OS version of Frontier are safe. That's what I want, and I believe that's what other developers with investments in Mac OS want too. As long as that's true, there's nothing to worry about.<p>

Other people raise issues here that are scenarios where Apple stops supporting the Mac API. I think instead of speculating on what would happen if that happened, let's wait to see if it does happen. At that point, I believe, your issue is with Apple, not with Mac developers. <p>

However, given the thoroughness of the "base-coverage" that Apple has outlined, I think they "get" this, that their momentum with developers is largely around the Mac APIs. It would be very foolish for them to throw that away.
