Congrats on trying Linux.  I decided to try Linux this summer because of the inhumane things Win95 was doing to my poor 486. [who wants to start PETOC: "People for the Ethical Treatment of Old Computers" with me? :)]  Well, needless to say, Frontier is the only reason I use my Win95 partition now.<p>

Everyone has given you some great start points so far, especially the Linux Documentation Project at <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/">http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/</a> .<p>

Here are a few sites I find pivotal to my daily Linux needs:<p>

<a href="http://www.slashdot.org">http://www.slashdot.org</a>
  Need that daily dose of /. as much as scripting news.  Don't ask me how but Linux gets easier as you become more involved with the community; it must be a mystical thing!<p>

<a href="http://www.linuxpower.org">http://www.linuxpower.org</a>
  Cool new site with quick tutorials and interviews<p>

<a href="http://themes.org">http://themes.org</a>
  Great place to customize the desktop.  Everyone needs some playtime!<p>

<a href="http://themes.org/joelinux">http://themes.org/joelinux</a>
  Themes.org secret treasure.  A site dedicated to other sites helping novice linux users.  I learned to install my redHat 5.1 system from one of the sites listed here.<p>

<a href="http://freshmeat.net">http://freshmeat.net</a>
  A great software listing.<p>

<a href="http://www.eunuchs.org/linux/TkApache/TkApache_content.html">http://www.eunuchs.org/linux/TkApache/TkApache_content.html</a>
  A TK front-end for Apache Configuration.  I haven't tried it yet, but I've heard it's getting some great reviews.  Also check out Michael's general Linux page (<a href="http://www.eunuchs.org/linux">http://www.eunuchs.org/linux</a>), he's got some cool quick tutorials of his own.<p>

Good luck Brent.
