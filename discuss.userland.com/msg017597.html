If you don't get a response, you can start a similarly named site, start updating it, and I'll help you promote it. We should be covering and studying SVG as deeply as we're covering SOAP, for example. Don't let a domain name get in your way. And set it up with a group of editors if possible, so if people take a break the coverage doesn't stop. SVG is important.
