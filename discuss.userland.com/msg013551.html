I'm sure Opera will have a compelling offering as well,and IE eventually too.  That's what's great about the web, everyone has a choice.  I choose Mac+NS+Dreamweaver+BBedit, you choose Windows+IE+Homesite+Frontpage.  It's a big wide web and I'm glad we all have elbow room :)<p>

I think part of the fun of this discussion group is the sometimes peppery messages we exchange - it's good to feel strongly enough about things that we can vent to our peers.<p>

To be honest, I think that about 5 years from now we'll be sitting in our 3d virtual reality enviromental suits and chuckle about how we thought that any of this web stuff was that interesting.<p>

Now it's back to coding!
