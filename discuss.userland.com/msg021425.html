Originaly I thought bringing "rules" into this discussion was a red herring, but after thinking about it some more I agree, somewhat.  I'm not sure a rich-XHTML/OPML viewer/browser would worry about rules, but I guess it's in the same vein.<p>

If the chicken has to come before the egg to demonstrate the applicability of an "isExpanded" attribute, so be it.<p>
