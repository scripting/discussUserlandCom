Some time back, there was a posting by Brett Glass about the "Limerick License" he wrote as an alternative. I did not bother to save it locally becasue I figured it would always be searchable on the Userland server.<p>

Guess what...searching for "limerick" turns up a few articles, but not the one I need. As a further test, I tried "lab books and lawyers" which is the title of a posting I made a few weeks ago, and the search came up empty.<p>

Is this the way it's supposed to work? How does the search engine actually go about its business of cataloging items. The "Help" description implies that all pages in the discussion group contaiing "limerick" should have been returned, but they were not.<p>

Cheers, Ralph Hempel - P.Eng.
