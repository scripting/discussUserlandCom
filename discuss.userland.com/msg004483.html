This is the first time I've posted a message, so I hadn't run across it, but i'm editing this post as I type. I'll just have to adapt it to static pages in a site, i guess.</i><p>

Yes, you took the words right out of my mouth.<p>

The DG is the web-based interface into the CMS.<p>

You don't need to know anything about Frontier to edit messages in the DG.<p>

Your CMS running on the same server can pull the text out of the DG (easy to do) and push it thru your templates and render to a static page. That's how I do www.scripting.com home page.<p>
