This two-headed approach (responderAttributes vs. renderingAttributes) reminds me on FirstClass Server from a Canadian company called Softarc. FirstClass has BBS roots and is now marketed as messaging and collaboration product.<p>

They implemented a sophisticated access model which also has two sides: User/group privileges and conference/folder permissions. In the manual at <a href="ftp://ftp.softarc.com/fcis/docs/server/AdminGB.pdf">ftp://ftp.softarc.com/fcis/docs/server/AdminGB.pdf</a> (page 69-92) you find this features documented. It also describes how FirstClass deals with overlapping rights and restrictions.<p>

Disclaimer: We used FirstClass to build one of the biggest online systems in Austria called magnetCity. It is still operating but the focus of magnet lies on general ISP services.<p>
