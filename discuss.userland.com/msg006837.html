Correct. We chose this approach so that these files could be served from the file system by an industrial-strength web server, e.g. WebSTAR or IIS.<p>

<i>Is msgReader aware of these files out there in the file system?</i><p>

No, at least not yet. But mainResponder.discuss.editMessageForm is if you set its flShowFileList parameter to true. This script also contains some code demonstrating how to get a list of all files attached to a message.<p>

<i>It seems the new attach file feature set is geared towards a place to deposit binaries that an administrator might look at, approve, move into final position kind of scenario.</i><p>

I suppose it could be used that way, though that's not how we currently use it. It's up to you!
