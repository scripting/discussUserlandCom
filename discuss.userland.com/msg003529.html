He said the problem was in the addMessage routine. I went right to mailToTheFuture.addMessage, that was the place that was most obvious to me, and stared and stared at the code. It was right, I remembered writing it, and testing it.<p>

Anyway, it turned out that the problem was in a different addMessage routine, an RPC handler (I should have figured it out, they're coming in thru RPC, not thru the HTML interface. That's where the time was wasted.)<p>

Anyway, as we roll out Frontier 6, we're working with a lot more than Frontier.root now. When reporting a problem, please give us the full address of the object in question. There are addMessage routines all over the place, virtually every new type of content has a connection to messages.
