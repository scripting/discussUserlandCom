It has to be very short until folks ask you to say more, which is frustrating.<p>

You must wait until they ask because only dialogues are very engaging. To get them to ask, you must threaten them or assume a pose which makes them want to find out more.  You have to taunt and tease, like your audience is a bunch of four-year-olds.<p>

Your story needs to have some momentum of its own, so it's not stillborn if no one wants to help push.  The threat that you'll cross some finish line by pushing all alone can be wonderfully motivating to others who wonder what that might entail.<p>

Your story has to be dramatically interesting, like a Hollywood movie, or better yet, like a well-told piece of folklore.  If your audience doesn't care how the story ends, or what happens to the protagonist, then your vision is going nowhere.
