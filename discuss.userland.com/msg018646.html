I wasn't there, and have only seen Ballmer on videobites, 
others' interpretations and <b>Pirates of Silicon Valley</b>.
So what do I know?<p>

But the above description seems like it can only be a subjective
impression.  Maybe that's obvious, but the point about journalism
is that your feelings about a speaker color what you hear.  Cooper
obviously has different feelings about Ballmer than you do, Dave,
and each of us has our own long and complex expansion of
"fatherly," for example.
