The issue most people are going to have with this is that ACS still is written a tcl, which a lot of folks just plain don't like.<p>

But, the fact that ArsDigita released a module that allows their open source software to work with Apache, as well as the native AOLServer it's built on, shows that they understand the need and are responding to people's requests.<p>

I wouldn't be surprised to see someone come along with an open source CMS that does everything Dave wants. The nature of that open source CMS  would have to allow people to develop convenient hooks into the various other pieces of software people are using; things like Frontier, <A HREF="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</A>, Vignette Storyserver, Broadvision, and ACS.<p>

The problem there is that companies like Vignette make their money by selling expensive services to set up and maintain their proprietary CMS packages. For them to allow people to write hooks that are compatible with their packages is not in their best interest. And the same can be said, to some extent, for CMS packages like Frontier and Broadvision.
