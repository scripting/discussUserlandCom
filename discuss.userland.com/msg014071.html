If you respond to a story (or respond to a response to a story) Manila <b>does</b> say "In response to (the name of the story)". I came here to post a note saying that was one feature I do like! <p>

I gave up on the <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> discussion interface for several reasons:<p>

First, their page always seemed dog-slow (even at work). That may have been a perceptual thing - I don't mind waiting a few seconds for a single message I'm interested in, but waiting longer for a list of stuff, most of which I'm <b>not</b> interested in, drives me nuts.<p>

Second, I don't like the ratings. I'll decide what authors or subjects interest me, thank you. (However, I kind of would like a filter to not show anything posted by an "anonymous coward" sometimes...)<p>

Third, the whole site just bothers my eyes - even after switching to Verdana per <a href="http://www.camworld.com">Cameron</a>. It's so messy and complicated that I never, until you pointed it out, saw the UI for changing the sort order, threshold, etc. <p>

Fourth, for some reason the quality of most of the posts seems lower than on most Frontier discussion groups. Slashdot has some great posts to be sure, but the signal-to-noise ratio is not what I would like most of the time. <p>

Back to Manila, I would like a way to auto-quote parts of what I'm responding to. But this is probably a limitation of the browser interface?<p>
