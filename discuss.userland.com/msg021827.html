Frontier 6.0
One longtime advocate of playing well together is Dave Winer, creator of  the Frontier scripting system and publisher of Scripting News, devoted  to "News and commentary from the cross-platform scripting community."  Frontier, recently released at version 6.0, "is the first Content  Management System that works like powerful systems for print  publishing," explains its Web site. <p>

Despite the sound of that marketing-speak, Frontier isn't just another  Web publishing tool. First, it's a product with a strong character.  Winer's touch is evident throughout Frontier. As he told us, there's an "incredible synergy we can achieve if we connect scripting environments  of all flavors on all kinds of systems. I think Web sites are WANs [wide  area networks], and the more we allow our communities to connect  together at a technological level, the more effective we all will be." <p>

He's also written that, "If you look at the competitive landscape in 
publishing software, you'll see that they're all built around scripting 
.. Customization is key, and where customization is important, 
scripting is central." It's evident both that the motivation for Frontier is far more an engineering than a financial one, and that 
Winer's engineering basis is the one we favor: scripting. <p>

We don't often cover Frontier developments because the user interface  doesn't run on Sun operating systems (only MS Windows and Mac OS). It's  also different from the Perl, Python, Rexx, Tcl, etc., crowd: unlike  their most recent incarnations, it feels like a scripting language for  gluing together external pieces, with less emphasis on general-purpose  development. <p>

However, it's timely to note a few of version 6.0's features: 
<ul>
<li> Perl, Tcl, Python, and AppleScript can be plugged in place of 
      Frontier's built-in scripting language </li>
<li>Frontier extends its integration with XML by supporting XML-RPC as  a mechanism for language-neutral XML-based distributed computing </li>
<li> More generally, version 6.0 achieves what author Matt Neuberg  calls the Grand Unification: managing all the "stuff that helps   constitute a Web page" </li>
</ul>
Like versions 1.0 through 5.0, there's a lot to like about Frontier's 
implementation. It's swift in operation and robustly built. Jorn Barger  is a prolific Web author who gave us a few examples of what Frontier does for him: <p>

     The simplest, most useful thing is having any given page of my Web  site just seconds away from touch-ups, instead of the ridiculous   finder-overhead of the Mac OS. I've customized it to where I can   specify "no tags markup" for italics, bold, etc., and when I hit    Publish Page Frontier does all those conversions and uploads the   finished HTML page. <p>

     It has a shared-menu functionality that (almost) effortlessly gave    me the power to hit a Control key from within Netscape and have the   relevant detail of whatever page I'm browsing be placed into my Web  log page, either in the Headlines section or with a pullquote and  More button. <p>

If you work with Web applications, you owe yourself the opportunity to see how Frontier can benefit you.
