<ul>
<li>X and Y do not have to be connected to the Net simultaneously, or make any prior arrangements, except that X's client program must post to the same netnews group that Y's client program reads.
<li>Neither X nor Y need a server; they can make do with dialup connections to an ISP that provides nothing more than netnews and Web service.
<li>Aside from being able to provide the URLs to J and K, neither X nor Y needs to have access to the servers that host J and K.
<li>J and K do not need any special programs running on the servers that host them.
<li>In a pinch (or for debugging purposes), X can use trn, Netscape Messenger, or some other standard news client to post the link (as long as X types in a properly formatted message "by hand"), and Y can use a standard news client to search the links.
</ul>
I don't know a lot about XML-RPC, but from what I know about it, I don't see what benefit it provides for this purpose.
