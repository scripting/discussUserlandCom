While this may not be the best deal around, they put the machine together in under 2 hours from the time I first called them, and helped me debug drivers on my NT Server install over the phone, after I had hooked it up at its new home. PCClinic is a little ma & pop store there, and back here in Marin County, I've had similar luck with our local ma & pop store, PCPlus (Novato, CA). Gateway had quoted me over $3,000 for a similar machine (450MHz PII, 128MB, 10GB, 100-base e-net, AGP video card w/o monitor), and they would have taken over a week to get the machine to me. However, Gateway would have pre-installed Windows NT Server, and the $1,650 machine I bought in Milwaukee didn't include it. So add $700 (that much?) for NT Server and about 2 hours of install time, and I came in at $2,350, which is still $700 less than Gateway wanted.
