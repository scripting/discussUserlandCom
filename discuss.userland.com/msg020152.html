<i>I'm amazed at your volumnous capacity and tenacity on the subject of the GPL. I mean, not only on this
                                 discussion board, but all over the 'net.</i>
<P>
That's because it is an important issue, and because too few people have recognized how much damage the GPL has already caused.
<P>
<i>Anyway, I do not see how I am obligated to allow you to make a living from my creativity.</i>
<P>
You're not. However, do not attempt to deny me the right to make a living via my <i>own</i> creativity.
<P>
When you release your code to be used at no cost by end users, you drive its market value to zero. Therefore, I cannot make a living from the code you released; it has no market value. I can only make money if I add <i>new</i> value to it that people are willing to pay for. I am not making money from your work; I am making money solely by virtue of my own. If you release the code under a truly free open source license, such as the MIT X license, I can do this. What the GPL does is attempt to confiscate my rights to my value added so that I cannot make a living. This is malicious and wrong.
