I dealt with a couple of their machines a long time ago, they felt good and had _really_ good monitors for the time.  But that was a while ago.<p>

Why do I like them now?<p>

I asked for a quote on a micron laptop for my office. A month or so later, they sent me a follow up/marketing questionaire via email. Normally I'm violently anti-spam, but this one was different. <p>

They offred me $12 for completing the survey. They paid in cash, in fresh crisp bills.<p>

A few months later, they did the same thing, this time for $10.<p>

I like their style, and their willingness to pay for survey information. <p>
