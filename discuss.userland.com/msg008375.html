is that there will NEVER be enough cheap bandwidth between the 
servers and the user device (what ever it is).  Those that 
think otherwise, are ignoring the laws of economics, physics and
intertia, particularly the economics of commmunication 
infrastructures - building communications infrastructure is 
never cheap and the rate of return can be quite low.<p>

For example, today, office buildings are still being wired with
CAT-3 wire (10 mbps max) instead of CAT-5 because it is less
expensive.  Unfortuantely, building LANs are addressing a 
smaller portion of the overall personal systems, because portable
PCs are the fastest growing part of the PC business.  Once you
are out of your office, all the connection technologies are quite
slow, particularly if you get more than a few miles out of one
of the big cities (as an example, my "nationwide" pager could never
work in the city of Elko which sits on I80 in NE Nevada).<p>

It has been my experiance that the best total solution design
should assume low bandwidth between devices and put the various functions where they work the best.  In this case the user presentation should be in the user device and the data crunching should be in the device that stores the data (why move the data just to crunch it).  Doing otherwise, makes the solution sub optimal and ultimately wasteful of the users time and energy.<p>

I have a lot of background in communication technology and economics
and will be glad to expand on this if any one cares.
