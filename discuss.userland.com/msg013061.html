Both of these are types of sites that are in the purview of <A HREF="http://www.flutterby.com/">my weblog</A> anyway (although I'll probably be more liberal about my selection criteria than normal), and this answers several of the criticisms of "World AIDS Day" and <A HREF="http://www.bradlands.com/dww/about.html">A Day Without Weblogs</A> that I expressed in <A HREF="http://www.flutterby.com/archives/1999_Oct/12_Foracause.html">For A Cause</A>.<p>

Incidentally, while it's easy to come up with links about how we've lost so many artists to AIDS, it's been pretty difficult to come up with memorials to those artists (or even their names, in some cases) and celebrations of their work, all the more reason that I prefer my strategy.
