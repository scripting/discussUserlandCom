I am currently thinking about following possibilities:<p>

<ol type="A">
<li>opening word and using VBScpript to cut+paste content via clipboard. Problem here:<ol>
<li>how to deal with images and embedded objects</li>
<li>how to deal with styles</li></ol></li>
<li>opening word and using VBScript to filter the file through <a href="http://www.g-foods.com/w2css/">w2css</a> an process the output of this with the <a href="http://einstein.stcloudstate.edu/tagExtractionKit/">tag extraction kit</a>. Questions here<ol>
<li>Can this work?</li>
<li>Does this work with images as well?</li>
<li>Do I have to set up specific Word Templates?</li>
</ol>
</ol><p>

Processing Word files as input seems to be a very common demand. In many institutions people learned to use Word for typing their stuff in and the arguments on staying there are very strong.<p>

Cany anyone think of other ways?<p>
