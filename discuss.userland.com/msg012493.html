But mindless stuff is annoying and sometimes gets in the way. I couldn't believe all the ridiculous posturing and theorizing over SalonHerringWiredFool.Com. The shit hit the fan for me when I read Jeremy Bowers' posting. He comes off as such a friendly person. He might as well have stabbed me in the back, if anyone from any of the pubs read his comments. I can understand an asshole like Rogers taking a cheap shot (if he posts here again I'll block him permanently) but Jeremy? Then I figured it out. These people just like to post, they don't invest *any* time thinking.<p>

Do you know how much background work went into SHWF.COM? How much time goes into every DaveNet piece? Then I had another realization -- "These people are not my friends." Then I had to ask, why am I working so hard for them? What's in it for me?<p>

Actually I've been asking myself that question continually. I finally got up the guts to raise it here.
