When will there be 50,000 copies of Mac OS X Server running? The demand for Mac-based servers that run Unix has never been shown to exist (persist) at this level. If I want a commercial Unix server, I'm going to go buy a HP box, a Sun box, or even a SGI box before I try out Apple's latest experiment in the Unix world.<p>

Mac OS X Server seems to provide one single compelling application that cannot be realized with any other platform. It provides a way to make the iMac work as the NC it was originally designed to be. The network booting and centralized administration will be nice for Macs in a lab. But as any sort of Unix-based application server, it's just not going to have the base of tools to draw on that more mature platforms in the market enjoy (like the ones I mentioned above.) If I was going to be in the business of writing enterprise applications for Unix servers, I'd do it for something with a proven market share.<p>

I can see we're beating a mostly dead horse at this point. I interpret that you are focused on the value of the technology itself and I am examining the business merits of supporting Mac OS X. I won't debate the technology merits. Apple has shown year after year that the marketplace doesn't recognized superior technology. <p>

People buy platforms with lots of inexpensive, supported, functional, reliable software. It is very risky to base a production Internet server installation on a platform as new and untested as Mac OS X Server. If I was setting up a lab of Macs, I'd be all over this platform. But name one other thing that it does better than its server competitors right now. That's why I don't see the market growing and why I don't see it as a viable platform to build on.<p>

I'm going to leave it at that. I'm beginning to repeat myself and for those who got my point in the first message, I apologize for being pedantic.
