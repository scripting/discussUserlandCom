Cool.  I assume this means that you will have some sort of rules-based system for selecting stuff to put on Scripting News (or will it just be that you will have people all around the globe helping with the updates)?  If so, what type of mechanism to you use for developing the rules (obviously not everything that changes on every site you track can make the main Scripting News page)?
