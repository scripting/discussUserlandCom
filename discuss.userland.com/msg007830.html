In fact all data that is sent to or received by a WAP mobile phone (Nokia 7110 etc) is defined as binary encoded already eg WML/WMLscript.<p>

The interesting thing is that all the European mobile network operators are adding GPRS capability to their networks (Packet data over the existing switched network) which will offer data connections at about 115K. UK networks will be offering this commercially early in 2000 which will allow them to offer 384K by early 2001. In this context I'm not sure that binary encoding of data is as important as it once looked to be to evryone involved in WAP/Mobile Internet!
