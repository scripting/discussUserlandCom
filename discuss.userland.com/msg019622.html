While he told it, I rubbed my own heart. I had to keep telling myself "I'm not having a heart attack now, hearing this story won't hurt me." <br><br>	He had the heart attack at Stanford Hospital, while they were trying to figure out what's wrong with his body. At one point he asked "What's going on?" The doctor said calmly "You're having a heart attack." I guess if you have to hear those words, that's the person you want to hear them from.<br><br>	He's become something of a celebrity at Stanford. Imagine how long you have to wait, as a doctor, before a heart attack happens while a patient is hooked up to all the instruments. <br><br>	They saved him. Cleaned out his circulatory system. Got his blood pressure down. Gave him all kinds of drugs and vitamins. Now he's exercising and eating better. <br><br>	To me, the best thing is that my friend is now telling more about himself. Why not? If he hadn't been at the hospital when it happened, he'd be dead. More evidence that we don't get out of this alive. Don't wait. Do it now. There might not be a tomorrow.<br><br>	If you made it this far, here's your reward, a piece of virtual cheesecake. No calories or fat.<br><br>	"cheesecake"<br><br>
