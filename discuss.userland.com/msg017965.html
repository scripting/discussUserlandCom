Does it work for the artist.<p>

Is ASCAP, like the major labels, just another thing to work around?</I><p>

I believe ASCAP and BMI just deal with composer royalties, not the recording artist (unless they are one in the same). Why work around it? Are the composers any less deserving of compensation for their creativity than recording artists?<p>

So how is the income going to get to the artist? That is still the big Q. There doesn't seem to be a mechanism in place to get the money to the artist like ASCAP and BMI do for composers. That's what the industry has been exploiting for all these years. Napster could become that mechanism.
