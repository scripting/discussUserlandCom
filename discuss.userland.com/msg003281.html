I just saw a PR announcement about a new product called Meeting Maestro, which proports to help measure objectively a variety of the things which also affect a meeting. <p>

The company's homepage is at <a href="http://www.su5.com/">http://www.su5.com/</a><p>

I'm NOT advocating the product, but simply trying to point out other areas that affect meeting flow. I think their suggestion of having a meeting monitor recording this kind of data, while Bernie's technographer keeps the agenda moving forward could be interesting.<p>

Downside --> more bodies in the meeting room.
Upside -->  more data about the meeting<p>

Their list of meeting items begins to get at some of those issues that have been discussed in this thread; for instance, how did the group arrive at a decision, and that consensus thingy.
