There's a hard limit in the OS, so opening up the limit may not be possible. Mac OS 8.6 has a lot of files it opens itself, plus many applications are opening more files just to run. I'm really missing the days when an application was a single file. I've got ten files open just to run Netscape (with no window opened, even). Another 11 for my email program.<p>

One thing that will help is combining your fonts into either a single suitcase (just drag them all into a single file) or a few sets. One file open instead of a few dozen, and you'll be able to open more.<p>
