We'll find a way to hook up with you if there's a need to. <p>

I think one of the unseen benefits of our XML-RPC spec is that hidden inside it is an object serialization format that's reasonably well thought out. It's worked so far, for quite a few months at moving big chunks of data around our net, almost effortlessly from a scripting point of view. We're just sending around structs and arrays which map perfectly onto table and list structures in Frontier.<p>

Also, it would be great if you could tell us something more about yourself on your prefs page.<p>
