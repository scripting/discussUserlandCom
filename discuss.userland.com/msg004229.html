IE5 bundles the Alexa Engine (The same engine used in Netscape's "What's Related"). The difference is that they're not going to let the PR flak hit them- they'll just point to Alexa ("the users wanted it!") and neatly pass it all on. Still, your URLS are going to be flying about. (Can anyone who's using IE5 confirm this?  Can the feature be turned off? Is it on or off by default?)<p>
