Think translation! Allow me to exceed the scope of your request a little and suggest a taking a look at a market where Frontier could make serious inroads.<p>

There is a serious, growing market for translation and software localization tools that enable effective collaboration over the Net.<p>

IBM's Translation Manager keeps its data in SGML format. The two main jobs of the application are to provide translation memory and glossaries to the translator and integrate them with a text editor. But although Translation Manager is internally powerful, it is an interface disaster.<p>

Developers should be alerted to the potential of the translation market. With its built-in object database, Frontier seems perfectly suited to creating uniquely powerful, customizable, cross-platform, net-ready translation tools. What is really missing is full Unicode support. You could open up a tremendous market for Userland, perhaps in collaboration with a third party Frontier developer. There could be a cross-platform XML translation suite and it could be a Frontier application.<p>

I would personally be happy to help connect the team with seasoned translators to assist in designing the product to operate with maximun efficiency in the hands of language professionals.<p>

For a very good overview of the various questions involved and the current state of the market, I would suggest getting hold of the latest issue  of Multilingual Computing at your local newsagent or visiting their site at <a href="http://www.multilingual.com/">http://www.multilingual.com/</a>.<p>

You need to realize that Frontier could soon be expanding into a new area. I am confident that your friend Phil Suh would whole-heartedly agree with me on this.<p>
