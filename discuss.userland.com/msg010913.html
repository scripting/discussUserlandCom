I've just bought it, so I can't give you a review yet, but it looks to be a good introduction to IMAP (and other protocols and formats).  You can get the same info from the IMAP RFC's but I for one would rather start with O'Reilly's clarified, distilled version.  <p>

BTW, my experience with the Python IMAP library is that while it deals with much of the mechanics for you, you'll need a knowlege of the protocol as well.
