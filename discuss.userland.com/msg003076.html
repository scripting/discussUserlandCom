How do I disable Microsoft's friendly front-end so I can dig in and find out what went wrong? In less than forty minutes I had <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3077">the answer</a>. <i>Excellent!</i><p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3080">Bernie De Koven describes</a> an experiment he did with online technography.<p>

<a href="http://www.sunlabs.com/research/forest/COM.Sun.Labs.Forest.doc.external_www.PJava.main.html">PJama</a> is an "experimental persistent programming system for the Java programming language, that embodies the notion of orthogonal persistence: an approach to making application data persist between program executions with the minimum possible effort required from the application programs themselves." Frontier users have had one of these since 1992; all globals in Frontier persist, you have to do nothing to make them persist. <i>That's pretty close to minimum!</i><p>

A wise person asked "If Nirvana was the code name for Frontier 6, what could possibly come after that? In other words, what would the codename for Frontier 7 be?" <i>Hmmmm.</i><p>

Another wise person once asked, many years ago, how could there possibly be a WordPerfect 2.0? <i>Maybe that was their downfall?</i>
