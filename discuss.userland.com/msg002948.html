1. What is the relationship/difference between WSF in Frontier 5.1.x and the mainResponder in Frontier 6?<p>

2. Is mainResponder just a clever and full-featured dynamic website implemented using WSF and guest databases?<p>

3. Is mainResponder THE framework on which all dynamic Frontier website applications will be built from now on?<p>

4. Is mainResponder the same as DynAuthor in principle?<p>

Part of the answer to all of these, I'm sure, is to download, dig in and see, but I'm trying to get the big picture so the little bits make sense.<p>

TIA<p>
