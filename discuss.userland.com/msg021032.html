<b>Original Post</b><p>

<i>All lawyers disagree. From what I hear, they think that this license cannot be enforced if that clause is removed.</i><p>

My lawyer thinks otherwise. :-)<p>

I'm going grossly oversimplify, and omit some moderately important details. This is <i>not</i> legal advice. I am not a lawyer, not do I play one on TV.<p>

<b>Choice of Forum</b><p>

<i>[snipped]</i><p>

<b>Why This Matters</b><p>

Some <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/">third-party developers</a> want to combine the Python code with GPL'd code. Both Guido and Stallman want to encourage this, and neither wants to create outages for those developers.<p>

<b>The Likely Outcome</b><p>

<i>[snipped]</i><p>

As a Python developer, I'm hoping that the lawyers reach some sort of no-outage agreement. If they <i>don't</i> reach an agreement, then projects such as the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/">Gnumeric spreadsheet</a> will wind up using obsolete versions of Python.<p>

And that would just suck. :-(<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric<p>
