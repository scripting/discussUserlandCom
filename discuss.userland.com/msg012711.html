But that Cosmic and Solar radiation can flip random bits of RAM.  The article said that as RAM sizes increase, the chance of having random memory errors increases greatly.  There is already a measurable increase in RAM problems in high altitude places like Colorado, when compared to lower altitude places.  <p>

Perhaps you should put your router under the floor in a metal shielded case?  Then those nasty solar radiations won't kick your RAM's ass. :-P<p>

Just a thought. :-)
