If there are problems we want to solve them. We share a love of music, and the new medium of the Internet and music. <br><br>	We are not pirates, we don't want something for nothing. But we want the economics of music to be fair, we want professional and artistic relationships, and abhor the legal battleground that music has become. <br><br>	(There are no MP3s on this site.)<br><br>	Tell your friends that there's now an independent source of news about music on the Internet. We'll cover it all, with your help. We also provide an easy way for musicians and fans to start their own sites. The Web and music were meant to be together, now we take the next step.<br><br>	<i>Let's have fun!</i><br><br><b>Quote of the Day<a name="quoteOfTheDay">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/17#quoteOfTheDay" title="Permanent link to 'Quote of the Day' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/politics/071700lives-leahy.html">NY Times</a>: "Everybody is in favor of the First Amendment," Leahy said.
