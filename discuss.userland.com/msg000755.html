So read a general intro to UNIX and drop in the shell the book use (when you are in the command line interface, type ksh for the Korn Shell, csh for the C shell, bsh I think for the bash shell (the one LINUX use)). Then buy a book from O'Reilly on the shell you think you will use (there is one on the Korn shell that I read and that gave me a better understanding of UNIX, another one on the Bash shell that look very interesting). Also buy the UNIX in a NutShell for references (O'Reilly). <p>
