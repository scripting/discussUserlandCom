(Note that I'm not saying it's a good thing, I really dislike many of the UI details of Windows and KDE, as well as a few of the mac interface choices.)  I'm from a somewhat minimalist school of design as expressed by Edward Tufte's books, The Visual Display of Quantative Information, Envisioning Information, and Visual Explanations.<p>

The reason that people are becoming more tolerant is that they are using the web and being bombarded by hordes of junk uis. One can't be non-tolerant and hope to get any information out of the web. Every single site has their own interface quirks, and as far as I can tell, no one has come up with the killer interface.<p>

DHTML may change this, or it might make it worse.  I cringed when I saw the screenshots of the broadband version of the mttf site, and not just because it took a long time to load.  I cringed because of the multiple layers of tabbed dialog boxes.  Tabbed dialogs are one of those features that I think is confusing, mainly because they are needlessly modal and information dense without being clear. <p>

Of course, the ui of the broadband mttf is their choice. Given the current state in computing, I don't think arguing against tabbed dialogs is going to be any more effective than arguing against gifs of text on the web. <p>
