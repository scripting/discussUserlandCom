writing on Macs. It might be that I've always been like this.<>p><p>

It might be coming out of the Virginia Swamps with a 
backbeat slow and hard to master.<p><p>

But I remember hearing about Unix machines in the late 80s and early
90s and thinking "Wow. That's the big stuff!" Now it is what I deal with every day.<p><p>

And having a wife who isn't a Unix person, and kids whose games
don't work under WINE, I'm used to having non-Unix systems around.
And my wife rolls her eyes and groans whenever I answer her questions
about her computer with "Windows Sucks.", so I don't anymore.<p><p>

I used to have friends whose conversational hobby was slamming.
I would deflect their barbs with self-deprication, occasionally
slamming back when the opportunity arose. The problem was, I'd continue with this when I talked to other friends, and that pretty soon dropped the number of other friends. Since the friends who
were like that were people I knew on the internet 1988-1992, I'm guessing this is the same sort of people who call the opening of
the internet to non-geeks as "The Great September", viewing things
as the web as an intrusion on their networks rather than a great
opportunity. <p><p>

But while I still amuse friends and co-workers with flashes
of amusing conversations (such as refering to an Athlon as
"700MHz of Lovin'"), humor and self-deprication are far better 
ways of making friends and influencing people.
