<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/990705opmetcalfe.xml">InfoWorld</a>: Bob Metcalfe adds nothing factual to the Linux vs NT debate. Bob, what if powerful turnkey servers went for less than $1000? What kind of new networking markets might develop? Will Linux force Microsoft to match its price with an easy NT-based web server? I bet it does. <i>Servers everywhere.</i><p>

It'll be interesting to watch the <a href="http://my.userland.com/">My.UserLand.Com</a> story list over the holiday weekend in the US. It's usually a quiet period on the big corporate sites. Does the weblog world take a holiday too?<p>

(The URL is temporary.) It's a clone, the only way you can tell it's on Linux is the cute little penguin on the page. We now have the content flowing from the batchJobServer app running in Frontier on Mac OS, to the main My.UserLand.Com server running on NT, and flowing thru Zope and the <a href="http://postgresql.nextpath.com/">Postgresql</a> database on Linux. This reflects our philosophy of being an Internet developer, not specifically a Mac or Windows or Linux developer. They're all excellent operating systems, and they all have an important role to play in the evolution of the Internet.<p>
