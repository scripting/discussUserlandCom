Even though his Loudcloud isn't even a year old yet, you can bet your bottom that it'll have a hot IPO at some point. Loudcloud has the buzzwords (e-business and infrastructure), the backing (Benchmark Capital and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter) and the high-profile tech partner (Microsoft). It should be a lucrative IPO. The Netscape-Microsoft war is long gone; now it's time for Andreessen to make some money."
