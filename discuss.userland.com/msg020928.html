Where do <u>you</u> go to buy stuff on the Internet?  Books, music, electronics, toys... it doesn't matter.  Who are the Amazon equivalents that treat their customers so much more nobly and have a reasonably comparable user experience?<p>

It's easy to take potshots, but why not point out who is doing it better and why they are better?<p>
