<blockquote>"This was an epic tale not worth telling. The conventional wisdom circa the early nineties had been that the technical wizards of Northern California would meet the creative minds of Southern California halfway and create a brilliant new collaboration. But this was rooted in a naive view of what Holloywood was all about. Hollywood was merely a specialized bank -- a consortium of large financial entities that hired talent, almost always for a flat rate, ordered that talent to create a product, and then marketed that product to death, all over the world, in every conceivable medium. The goal was to find products that would keep on making money forever, long after the talent had been paid off and sent packing. <i>Casablanca</i>, for example, was still putting asses in seats decades after Bogard had been paid off and smoked himself into an early grave.<p>
