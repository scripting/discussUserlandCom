Remember that multiple Manila sites can share a membership group -- so if you login to one site, you're logged in to all of them.<p>

Also remember that you can make sub-sites: foo.com can be a Manila site, then you can create sites at foo.com/a/ and foo.com/b/ and so on.<p>

Your discuss URLs would be foo.com/discuss/, foo.com/a/discuss/, and so on.<p>

You could of course promote the discussion group to the top level of a site the way it is on this site by customizing the site itself. Move everything in the discuss table up a level and edit some of the strings in the #urls table. Then foo.com/a/ would be the URL of a discussion group.
