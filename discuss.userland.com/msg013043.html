Ditto, but I'm pretty sure I'll still be thinking about what to do when the time comes, which will mean I end up doing nothing. I've got a number of philosophical problems with <b>change your pages</b> movements in general, and this one's no different.<p>

Also, since I usually publish on Fridays (and sometimes Mondays), the fact that December 1 is neither a Friday nor a Monday makes it even more tempting to just do nothing.<p>
