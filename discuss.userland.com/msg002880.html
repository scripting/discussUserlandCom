Kendall updated it yesterday and renamed it "Wilma".  It addresses most of the weblog styles that we've seen: it is capable of handling both link-centric items, as memepool does, and issue-centric items, as Scripting News and some others do, or a combination, as Robot Wisdom tends to do.  HTML markup and standard ISO and Latin entities are available within the Wilma markup as well.<p>

You can read all about Wilma at <a href="http://ntlug.org/casbah/CML/Wilma">http://ntlug.org/casbah/CML/Wilma</a>.<p>

Your comments about Wilma and Camel (Casbah's main XML DTD) are always welcome on the Casbah mailing list, <a href="mailto:casbah@ntlug.org">casbah@ntlug.org</a>.<p>
