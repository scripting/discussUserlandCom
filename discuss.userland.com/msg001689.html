That's the surface.<p>

Beneath the surface there are more disturbing issues. A lynchpin is the death of Vincent Foster. When you read through Starr's evidence, you'll likely realize the final conclusion is not tenable. The Usenet challenges to the conclusion are overwhelming; the venom raised against questioners telling.<p>

If the entire conflict is as it's portrayed to us, then I doubt the bloodthirsty Republican team would focus only on the petty harrassment perjury. Foster, Jerry Parks, Mary Mahoney, Ron Brown's lawyer and Barbara Wise all have stories to tell.<p>

"How differently they talk among themselves." That's true. It's likely they speak more differently still when the camera lights are off.<p>
