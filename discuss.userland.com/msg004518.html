The stories are interesting, but the comments are as bad as Usenet.<p>

So I tried fooling around with the moderation feature. If you haven't done so yet, create yourself a user account, turn moderation on, set your cutoff to 2, and sort by score.<p>

Presto! Useful and interesting Slashdot comments. I'm suitably impressed. Unfortunately, the combined load of the new moderation and 600,000 hits/day seems to be slowing down Slashdot again. Oh, well.<p>

There's a lot to be said for the DG approach. People tend to be more reasonable when they have to provide a name and somebody occasionally puts a halt to flamewars.
