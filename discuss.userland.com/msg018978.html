They have IE on the Mac though and I imagine that future versions *could* include the common runtime.<p>

Is it the case that you can currently develop a reasonably complex Java (client-side) application on one system (Windows) and expect it to run on the others with good performance and reliability (Mac, Linux)? I've been very unimpressed with Java apps so far (the Forte IDE geing the most recent example). I also remember that at JavaOne Jobs & McNealy made a big thing about apologizing for how poor the current Apple Java VM is and promised things would get better "soon"...<p>

Probably the aspect that got me the most excited about the whole MS Common Runtime thing : based on previous MS frameworks, virtual machines and compilers I feel that they have a good chance of providing a great solution for dynamically loading code onto *Windows* machines. If their solution is reliable and performant then it could succeed in providing client apps where Java (as far as I can tell) has so far failed.<p>
