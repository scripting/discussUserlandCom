If it's the iMac, or a very cool user-oriented item - he just glows. If it's a server, or something like that, he's good but you don't get that same anxiety because you can't have it <i>right now</i>. MacWorld usually feels like Christmas now. You just can't wait for it to come. Not enough things in life do that.  A perk of being a Mac guy...<p>

When Steve really believes in what he's selling, you believe it as well. You believe against your best judgement. Its very disconcerting in a way - because you really can see that this guy  really could take 800 people into the jungle to drink Kool-Aid. He's speaking to 1,000 people in a room, but talking just to you.<p>

Dave, it doesn't surprise me that you read Jobs differently. Or Ballmer. For whatever reason you read people differently than many others do. I don't know why, but in what, 6 years of reading your stuff and watching your online interactions with others, you've usually read people differently than most people I know. It's part of what makes you interesting.
