I don't object to any of the items you mention, although they're nowhere near my top priority, but I'm strongly against a party that consistantly aligns themself with a particular religious viewpoint and tries to dictate how we live our private life.<p>

The Republican party always yells about "freedom" but they're the ones that want to butt into our personal lives in every way.<p>
