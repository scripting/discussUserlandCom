Manila's API and WebDAV are nearly identical, it should be easy to support both in a client, and then add the other yummy bits to Apache as a Python or Perl module. </i><p>

Ken, of course. The thing I need to say about Pike is that the Manila-RPC stuff is not in any way hard-coded in. It's possible for Pike to support any XML-RPC interface, or for that matter, most TCP interfaces including HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP and lots of others.<p>

This is a bootstrap process. The goal is to deliver functionality to writers, designers and graphics people, on their terms. <p>

The Manila-RPC spec is what Manila supports. If others want to use it, great, but I'd be happy with any scripting interface as long as it supports the goal in the previous paragraph.
