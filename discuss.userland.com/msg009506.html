1. TiVo/Replay units make it much easier to skip advertising entirely.  And Replay hints at an easily downloaded future feature that would remove commercials entirely.  One could draw an analogy here to the recent fervor over deep-linking and bypassing banner ads.<p>

2. Replay (and possibly TiVo) allows you to create "channels" that are defined by your own input.  Replay's own website makes mention of creating a David Hasselhoff channel that automatically records every Baywatch, every Knight Rider.  This is a new commodity as far as the networks are concerned and they want control of that.
