Why?<p>

Well, what i want to do is to store the components of the stories separately as some part are applicable to a wide audiance and some are more specific to readers with a narrow focus requirement. Storing the stories as parts will allow the updating of information in a part to flow automaticly into the compostite stories, instead of having to open every story to update them one at a time.<p>

Is this type of compositing of stories possible in the XML structure of the site, or will it require a plug-in to manila to achieve.<p>

Help on this would be great.<p>

Thanks
Mark Chettle
