The docs are on this page:<p>

What I'd love to see is a search engine implemented on Linux connected to MySQL, that supported this interface. <p>

We would be very interested in running that software here at UserLand to supplement our own search engine software which is designed for smaller indexing jobs. <p>

This seems like an ideal collaboration between CMS developers such as UserLand who work on Windows/Mac and developers who work on Unices.<p>

Would anyone like to work with us on this at this time?
