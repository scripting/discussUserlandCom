I can also put a filespec into that table, and then reference it as a base-level folder in my URLs.<p>

Thus, if I have a cell named "hires" in my manila.sites table that points to G: (as a filespec, and with the backslash quoted), then URLs of the type <a href="http://the.computer.com/hires/">http://the.computer.com/hires/</a> actually point to that filesystem; I can reference any file ON that drive.<p>

AWESOME.
