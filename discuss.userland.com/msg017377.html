Piazza del Duomo and the Naviglio market are wonderful places to start foot explorations of Milan. It amazes me that such beauty can exist in a city that I would otherwise describe as urban hell.<p>

If you decide to check out the nightlife, informing the bouncers that you're an American travelling on business almost guarantees entry.<p>
