A savings of a meg won't matter much.  A few megs of information isn't that big of a deal anymore.  <p>

The human ear can only hear so much quality.  Mp3 might have less quality than CD, but it really isn't detectable.  Mp3 is a small file,  near-CD quality, wide distribution, and only needs a low-end pentium.  I am not seeing any drawbacks yet.  :-)<p>

As a side note, I am rather glad that we have physical limits, where no more improvement need be made.  For instance, you won't need to worry about a 64-bit color depth, because the human eye can only see 32-bits of color.  Our retinas have a fixed resolution.  We won't need 85" monitors or 64,000x64,000 resolution displays.  16 bits of sound is all we need to deal with.(we just get 3D speakers now. ;-P)  Perhaps I won't have to spend $2,000 to upgrade my computer everytime the next generation of games comes out.  :-)
