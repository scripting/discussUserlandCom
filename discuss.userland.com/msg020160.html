It takes time, effort, and talent to create good code -- and Heaven knows that there's not anywhere near enough of it. It takes sweat and dedication, and it's appropriate to reward people for expending the time and effort to do it. The reward should be based on the quality and utility of the code, not the effort it takes to copy it. The programmer isn't in the business of pressing disks or selling bandwidth, and his compensation should not be based on the costs of these incidentals but on the value of his work.
