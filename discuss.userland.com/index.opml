			<outline text="You'll see a lot of the early bloggers writing here, before their blogs started. "></outline>
			<outline text="Lots of possibilities for little projects, like looking for historic posts, where ideas that became something were first discussed. Or all the posts from someone who became an influencer or super rich. Maybe that'll come later. For now I wanted to get this on the open web so it can be indexed by search engines and preserved by archive.org. "></outline>
