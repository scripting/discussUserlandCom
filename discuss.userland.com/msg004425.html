I'm glad I didn't get Active Desktop. Now I'm <i>really</i> glad I don't have this particular set of IE5's features. I'd love to have IE5 on my Mac, and thankfully, we in Mac land will <i>probably</i> never be subjected to the branded versions of Explorer. Ironically I think this is for the same reason we don't get Access- MS keeps the real "goodies" for its own platform.<p>


Like I said- I want IE5 on my Mac. I want the XML features. I want the DOM. But I <i>don't</i> want this particular battlefield brought to my front door. No thanks, Microsoft.<p>
