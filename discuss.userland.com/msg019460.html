The general rule seems to be that the label and the band split CD/LP profits 50-50.   The page at <a href="http://centerstage.net/chicago/music/whoswho/TouchandGoRecor.html">http://centerstage.net/chicago/music/whoswho/TouchandGoRecor.html</a>  has contact information, plus a glowing compliment from none other than Steve Albini about the quality of the label. (Not for the easily offended, I guess.) Touch and Go products can be found on the Web at <a href="http://www.southern.com/">http://www.southern.com/</a><p>

Another mensch would be Ian Mckaye of the band Fugazi and the label Dischord.  His policy has been for all shows to be all-ages, and ticket and cd prices to be kept low.
