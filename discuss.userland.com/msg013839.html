It's a huge leap up from m11. I really recommend if you have been holding back on trying out mozilla until now (Dave?) that you give this one a go.<p>

It installs without overriding any of your existing browsers. (Providing you install to a fresh directory)<p>


I'm basing my open sourced xul front end to manila  on M12.<p>

M12 is almost 'dogfood' (dogfood means that more than 50% of the engineers use it more than 50% of the time.) Dogfood comes from the  term "eat your own dogfood" - meaning that before it gets to beta, it's got to be 'dogfood'.
