The fruits of my labor can be found here... <a href="http://208.204.52.53:10000/test.xml?userName=josh">http://208.204.52.53:10000/test.xml?userName=josh</a><p>

What happens is that the servlet checks to see if the physical file exists, if it doesn't, the servlet makes an xml-rpc request to an xml-rpc server(thanks Hannes!!).  This request currently retrieves this file, <a href="http://www.stonecottage.com/josh/blurbs.xml">http://www.stonecottage.com/josh/blurbs.xml</a> and then the servlet uses this xsl file, <a href="http://208.204.52.53:10000/xsl/headlines.xsl">http://208.204.52.53:10000/xsl/headlines.xsl</a> for the formatting.<p>

Though the info isn't coming from a database, it could very easily be modified to do so.<p>

This is pretty cool and serving xml from Frontier and formatting it with xsl would be really nice and powerful.<p>
