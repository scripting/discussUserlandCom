However most corporations that use web servers for any kind of real work want reports that show usage. By week, month, whatever. It's that part of the organization which goes through all these machinations to justify its own existence. My impression is there is no tool to do this now... we'll have to write our own homegrown reporting tools. 
Has anyone built something which could be useful in this area?<p>

thanks for listening<p>
