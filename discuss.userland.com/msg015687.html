Appears to be back down.  Could somebody back me up here?  8:15 Pacific here.  Up at 8:30.  I suspect it's Pacbell, either on my end or your end.  I love Manila -- makes me feel powerful.<p>

UPDATE:  whatever it was appears to be fixed now.  Nevermind.  Back to playing with Manila. <p>

	<a href="http://benlog.editthispage.com">BenLog</a> is my new site.  <p>

	Manila is cool.  Thank you, userland.<p>

Is something wrong with "EditThisPage", or is it just from my end?  I can ping it, and traceroute to it, but I can't seem to get there.  And me trying to play with my new website, too.<p>
