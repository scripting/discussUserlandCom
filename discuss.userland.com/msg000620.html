Perhaps talking a little about how Scripting News fits into our day would better expose what a browser for Scripting News would ideally do.<p>

I'll throw my hat in the ring to start things off. <p>

I read Scripting News quite regularly (five-six times a day) and am most interested in the discussion that DaveNets, news items, etc. provoke. Dave has a completely different position in the software industry than I do, thus I find it most interesting to hear what he has to say. I'm also quite a fan of this discussion group, as interesting opinionated people congregate here.<p>

What is it about Scripting News that makes you come back? How could we make software that made what you like easier to get to?<p>
