I have classes which can connect to a server. Anything particular you'd like it to do? <p>

Actually, more interesting would be a Java applet that can receive XML-RPC calls. I'd like to send it a message saying "open a text editing window containing this text" and another one saying "give me back the edited text". <p>

If that's not possible we could flip it around, but that's the way the server works now.<p>
