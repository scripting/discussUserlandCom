Manila is showing an entry for the 5th of June 2000 for <a href="http://webfeet.editthispage.com/">http://webfeet.editthispage.com/</a> However when you click on it you get an error. <p>

This is the url:  <a href="http://webfeet.editthispage.com/2000/06/05">http://webfeet.editthispage.com/2000/06/05</a><p>

<pre>Sorry! There was an error: Can't evaluate the expression because the name "05" hasn't been defined. 
The error was detected by Frontier 6.2b15 in mainResponder.respond. Webmaster: <a href="mailto:webmaster@userland.com">webmaster@userland.com</a>. Time: Mon, 05 Jun 2000 11:19:23 GMT. </pre><p>

Manila Express refuses to post on 2000/06/05, even although it is the current day.<p>

It does not appear on my home page also, which it should. Has something funny happened during the recent Manila upgrade? I am using Malaysian time [+8:00 GMT] -- could that be the problem.<p>

Thanx.
