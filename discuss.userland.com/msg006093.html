I know that you are (and will be) swamped with "try this!!" requests.. so I'll be brief.<p>

There is a program out there called Virtual Network Computer (VNC) that is one of the most seriously cool products I've ever seen.  What it does is serve a desktop (Unix or Windows) anywhere you want to see it.  The effect is as if you picked up your computer and carried it wherever you go.<p>

I use it extensively at work.  I typically use 5 distinct computers -- "my" Solaris workstation, and 4 computers in different labs (1 PC, 3 Solaris).  I have the VNC server running on my "home" workstation and a VNC viewer on the PC and other workstations (there is also viewers for Macs AND a Java viewer if you want to use a web browser!).<p>

To use it, I just sit down at a remote workstation (or PC) and start up the viewer pointing at my home workstation.  Voila!  Up pops the exact desktop that is currently shown on my workstation.  This desktop "follows" me wherever I go.  Now that I have it, I honestly don't know how I did without it.<p>

Bonus: VNC is completely free.  Second bonus, you can go the "other" direction.  There is a VNC server for Windows.  This means that you can access your Windows desktop from any remote computer (Unix, PC, Mac, other).  I use this feature to access Word/Excel from my Solaris workstation.<p>

If you are at all interested in this, let me know.  I can step you through setting it up in as much detail as you want.
