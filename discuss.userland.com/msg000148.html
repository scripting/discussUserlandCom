Hi Jim,<p>

I'm using Lynx 2.8rel.2 and not seeing the problem you describe.  Perhaps it was taken care of with the change to support MSIE/mac?  Otherwise, which version of Lynx are you using?<p>

I _am_ seeing the message index being truncated partway through, but I doubt that the problem is specific to Lynx.<p>

There's two problems with the usernames on this BBS.  One is specific to Lynx and the other is a design flaw.
1) Lynx doesn't save cookies to disk.  So everytime I start a new session I have to look up my password again.
2) The passwords are stored in the clear in the cookie.  This is the lazy method used by SlashDot, but it's a very flawed design.
3) Cookies are bad in general: they break caching, assume that you always use the same machine and are problematic in other ways.    <a href="//">//</a> -james.
