I got to meet one of my heroes at the time, Dennis Ritchey, and eventually talked with him on the phone to tell him about my project to do a structured editor for Pascal running on his OS (Unix).<p>

My second first experience with the Internet (after drifting off to PCs where networking was a joke) was at a conference in southern California (Esther's? Stewart's?) where I got a demo from Doug Michels from SCO. He showed me the NCSA site and explained how the web worked. I laughed at him when he showed me a URL. I said Mac users would never go for that. (I was thinking to myself, "That's a Unix file name!" and "Oh my god, they're back!")<p>

I went to see him a few weeks later, and then went to see Sally Atkins at Stanford. Doug showed me how HTML works and Sally showed me the Palo Alto Weekly website. It took a few weeks of puzzling to figure out what was going on, and then I knew this what I was going to be working on for the forseeable future. That was all in the spring-summer of 1994.
