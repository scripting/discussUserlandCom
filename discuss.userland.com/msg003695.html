I use it for lesson planning, overheads, presentations, students often use it to prepare papers, I keep a journal in it (have since 19-- I don't even know.  I've go files galore and a couple of versions of MORE floating around.  I have college notes in it.  I am starting to switch to frontier and doing slideshows and other things (boy am I glad that fat headers arrived)  I am sure that MORE will have a place in my heart for a long time.  I wonder when I will let it go.  As Frontier evolves, I am less attached to my Mac (I am from the cold dead fingers Power Computing owners mentality)  With frontier on Windows, I got a lap top from the storage closet here at school.  Got a PO to get it fixed, and am now a 2 OS - one app man.  Thanks Dave, you make all the software I <b>really</b> use.
