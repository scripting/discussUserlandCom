Would you accept the XML parsing being done by a call to Jim Clark's expat or some other parser executed in another process?</i><p>

If there's a command-line version of expat, that would be an excellent way to go. Alternatively, you might be able to reuse the very good SGML parser that comes with psgmls-mode. (The latter is written in elisp, and runs fast enough for most purposes.)<p>

I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about XML-RPC, by the way.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric</br>
