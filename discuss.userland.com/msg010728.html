how about www.jacob.levy?<p>

or www.myownjacobsite.se, for that matter...<p>

the swedish domain authority has always used the policy that to
get a domain name, you need to have the rights to use that name
also in real life -- in other words, it has to be a registered
company name, or a registered trademark that's strongly associated
with your company.<p>

(and if you're operating an small business, you cannot register directly under .se unless you've registered your company in all
24 counties.  each county has its own subdomain)<p>

by obvious reasons .com, .to, and .nu domains are quote popular
over here...<p>

('nu' means 'now!' in Swedish, which opens up for great domains
like <a href="http://ge.astrid.lindgren.nobelpriset.nu">
ge.astrid.lindgren.nobelpriset.nu</a> ;-)
