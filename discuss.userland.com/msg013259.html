However, I think you could do better to concentrate on associate programs (also known as affiliate programs). Allan Gardyne has an excellent site on them at <a href="http://www.associateprograms.com/">http://www.associateprograms.com/</a>.<p>

I think that Frontier would be very good at implementing them - maybe in the style Yahoo links to Amazon. (When you search at Yahoo, you get a link to Amazon that has your search terms already entered.) Maybe a Frontier-based system could either look at the content of the page or the content of the user's preferences (if a cookie is present) to determine what ad(s) to show or which program(s) to link to.<p>

Presumably, each ad could be given certain basic target keywords that would be matched against the page content and maybe the top 1 or 2 ads in terms of how often target keywords appear could be served with that page. Maybe there could even be a keyword dictionary from A to Z that ads could be randomly rotated through so that, over time, the ads could adjust themselves to become more profitable. I think it would be surprising to see which ads got the highest response rate to certain keywords.<p>

If all this seems confusing, there is one banner exchange that already claims to do this on the web with their ad banners. SmartClicks at <a href="http://www.smartclicks.com/">http://www.smartclicks.com/</a> runs banners randomly until enough data is gathered, at which point the banner is moved into the category(ies) that garnered the highest click-thru rate.<p>

What do you think? Would privacy concerns override using someone's personal preferences to target an ad? Over time, would a system that adjusts ads for profitability lead to authors conciously or unconciously writing only pieces that are "profitable", for better or worse?
