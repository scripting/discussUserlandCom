I know that Outlook Express uses it and I suspect that Eudora and Apple are using it where they need to display HTML.<p>

I remember a while ago that MS made a big deal of bringing ActiveX to the Mac, but I'm not sure if it's something they are supporting right now or not.<p>

Another option might be to hook into Java and use the HTML display component that is part of Swing--the Java Foundation Classes.  With MRJ 2.1's performance improvements coming down the pike, that may be acceptable for this.
