Frontier gets the size of an image while generating the HTML for the img tag, before it gets the request for the image -- and since you're getting the HTML quickly, then it seems to me that getting the size is fast.<p>

One point: with GIFs, Frontier does not have to get the size of the GIF by reading from disk. If you look at html.getGifHeightWidth, you'll see that it works with images stored in a database. The same is not true for JPEGs, however.<p>

Another point: if you have #useImageCache set to true, Frontier does indeed cache the height and width of images, and on subsequent requests it just looks in the cache.
