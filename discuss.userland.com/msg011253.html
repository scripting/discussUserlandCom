depends, I suppose.  for example, the UK copyright law covers
"moral rights" which stays with the original author, even if
the copyright is transferred.   this includes the right not to
have a work subjected to "derogatory" treatment.  one document describing the UK laws give the following example:<p>

<i>Suppose a service takes original material, puts it on the WWW and
adds value by inserting a number of WWW links into the text to link
this item to other relevant items.  All the relevant copyright
clearances to download the material have been obtained.  The
author might still object to these links if he or she considers them
derogatory.  A link from the author’s paper might be to a Web page
of which the author disapproves (for example, Church of
Scientology home page, tobacco company home page, anti-abortion
group home page, neo-Nazi group home page, a link to a
paper by the author’s rival), and so on.  The creator can sue
because the article impugns the creator’s integrity by associating
the creator with something of which he or she disapproves.</i>
