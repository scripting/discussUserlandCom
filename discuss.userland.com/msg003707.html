There are people at Microsoft who are brave enough to suggest that. These are the people I talk with. (I also talk with some of the others.) Microsoft is a tempest on the inside. They argue all the time. Some people feel they should embrace the "slackware" movement. Some of those people have iMacs at home too.<p>

The thing that's interesting about Microsoft is that they hire your friends and mine, young and old, from all over the world. It's a messy place on the inside. New ideas do circulate, but you're right, that Gates's philosophy runs the place, to some extent. To a larger extent it's the ouija board that runs it.<p>

OTOH, if they stick to the belief that Windows is the only thing they can base their company on, they're going to end up with an IBM-size company (which isn't so bad btw).
