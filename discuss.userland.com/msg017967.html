I would if the MP3 files were of higher quality. There is no quality control of the files available on Napster. All ripping software is not created equal. I've compared some of the Napster-acquired files to files I created (using CD's I own) and have experienced the lousy encoding with my own ears.<p>

I'd guess the problem isn't so much with the music publishing companies as it is with their relationship to the distribution system. Look how many middlemen will get cut out or replaced in the system. Disk production, packaging, duplication, transportation, record stores, all obsolete. The music publishers most certainly have lots of pressure being applied to them by the infrastructure to maintain the status quo, even if it's not in their best interest.<p>
