For better or for worse, it's not <i>quite</i> that simple.<p>

Under the DMCA, it's clearly illegal to provide tools whose primary purpose is to help users infringe upon a copyright. But if a tool has "substantial and non-infringing" uses, is that tool forbidden by the DMCA?<p>

For example, a VCR allows you to make illegal copies of tapes. But it also allows you to record television shows and watch them at a later date. So a VCR has historically been protected under the doctrine of "fair use".<p>

Now, you <i>could</i> use DeCSS to help convert a DVD into a low-res QuickTime movie and pirate it. This would, of course, be an infringing use. On the other hand, you might use DeCSS to play store-bought DVDs on your laptop. This is a "substantial and non-infringing use". (Whether or not that laptop runs Linux is completely irrelevant.)<p>

So under the old rules, DeCSS was clearly legal. But under the new rules, nobody knows what will happen.<p>

Cheers,<br>
