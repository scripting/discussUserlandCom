It would take a little effort to update it, but it would be worthwhile for me to do so if there was sufficient interest.<p>

Please <a href="mailto:mdaw@yorku.ca">email me</a> privately if you need this kind of tool. I'll judge the response level, then I'll be better able to find a way to bring it all together.<p>
