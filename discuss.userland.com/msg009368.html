The onus is on them to generate traffic for their site--not you.  If they only want a certain kind of visitor--then they have the right to restrict their market. And they could certainly implement it server-side without too much trouble.<p>

Copying stories is one thing--that's definitely across the line.  But linking?  Who can control how people use their services?  Can a book author prevent someone from buring a book that's been purchased? Can you stop someone who smells like last week's garbage from getting on the bus and sitting near you?<p>

Yo! Webmaster @ Infoworld.  Do a log analysis of your incoming traffic and see how people come to your site: do they come in via the home page, or via links?  Calculate the percentages and lay that info in front of the linking policy makers.
