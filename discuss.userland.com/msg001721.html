Dave, <p>

an honest question, with the hopes of getting an honest answer in the respectful spirit in which it was asked: Do you expect people to act as you do on the group, or are you holding everyone else to a higher standard? I would interpret the above statement as a flame like almost any other flame, and I don't believe you are affording John the same respect you expect (and usually deserve) from the others on this message board.<p>

Just my opinion, like anyone else's.<p>

Thanks,<p>

-Pete
