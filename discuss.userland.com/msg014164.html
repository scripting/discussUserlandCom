But that's just me.</i><p>

I've always thought that Apple should gut out the core of AppleShare, and replace it with an integrated FTP server/client in there. Make it open, easily accessible to _anyone_ on the web. Make it easy to set up and use - as easy as AppleShare right now.<p>

Apple's gone file sharing over the internet, yes. Over TCP/IP, yes. But my PC friends can't see files on my drive (unless they fool around with NT's AppleTalk options)... :-(<p>

I would think this would have the nice side effect of making more those "20-mg disk space free" sites accessible to the mac users.<p>

You can talk about eye-candy (in the hardware, or in the software) all you want (and I must admit, I'm liking it too), but the word is COMPATABILITY. I want to access and use my files from anywhere - I want to remotely call programs on my mac from some PC (using rpc, I guess :) ). I want to fire up an FTP program and access my files. I don't want to think about it too hard. I just want to do it...<p>
