As nice as the docserver html pages are, it'd be nice to have inline Docserver. I can see formatting wp text objects to display the docserver info in a 'pretty' way, similar to Verbi. (rendering to wptext objects, and then hooking up the option/alt-doubleclick action)<p>

the feature request is, to make wptext objects lockable--noneditable, so that you don't inadvertently edit the docserver page.<p>

I think the discussion about obsoleted wp verbs got me thinking about this.
