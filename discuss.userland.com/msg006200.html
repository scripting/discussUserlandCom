This could work.<p>

<i>what parameters would identify that the user is submitting the signup form?</i><p>

How mainResponder.members.checkMembership knows about this is by looking at the pathargs field in the param table - it's value is "signupForm" in that case. Your security script could do the same...<p>

<i>Is the pageTable available at the time the #security script is run?</i><p>

The #security script runs while the page table is still being assembled. But the pathargs field -- which is the one you need to look at -- is already there.<p>

You can't use html.getPageTableAddress though because the #security script doesn't run in the context of the website framework. But everything in the param table appears as globals to the #security script. Here's the relevant part from the gatherAttributes handler in mainResponder.respond that calls the security script:<p>

<pre>local (adrsecurityscript = @adrtable^.["#security"]);
if defined (adrsecurityscript^) &#123; //great! the sysop is using a cool feature
	callScript (adrsecurityscript, &#123;}, adrparamtable)} //scriptError to kill request
</pre>
