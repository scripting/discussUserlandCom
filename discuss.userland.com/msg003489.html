for the first time.<p>

This new installation had 3 major hiccups that we should 
be aware of when considering setting up MTTF on new servers,
and documenting that process.<p>

   1) We had to manually create a mailToTheFutureMembers group in mainresponder before signups will work.<p>

   2) We had to modify the addMessage routing to create the MailToTheFuture table in the user's account if it one doesn't exist (the case when a user creates his first message)<p>

   3) Danger in bolting the mailer to a mail server with SPAM filtering.
      
      MTTF Is not compatible with some configurations of SPAM Filtering.<p>

      In the SPAM filter config in the mail server we had pointed MTTF to wouldn't send messages unless either the FROM user had a mailbox on the server or the TO user had a mailbox on the server.<p>

      It's not clear yet whether we can configure a mail server's SPAM filter to allow ANY user TO/FROM as long as the mail request came from within a network, or specific IP address.<p>
