Re what the xml-rpc call should return. Probably something like this. A list of locations in the text that contain words that are flagged by the spell engine. The location is indicated by a 1-based offset into the text. Along with each location, include a list of words that might be the correct spelling. Then it's up to the UI to decide how to present the options. It would work equally well for a web app like Manila or a desktop app like Pike.<p>

How does that sound?<p>
