Maybe Bierman can help us out here? Or perhaps someone who knows NT really well? <p>

I have a dual CPU machine, and in the performance monitor, I have it set to show each processor independently. When I do a heavy task in Frontier both curves go up, but it's very hard for me to put a serious load on this system. <p>

This is the only dual-cpu machine I have here (there's another in Seattle, running our search engine and the Frontier site).
