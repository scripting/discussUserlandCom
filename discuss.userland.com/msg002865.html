I'm writing up a proposal to send to <a href="http://www.webhosting.com">webhosting.com</a> and I'm given the impression that if there is interest, they would be happy to host another NT server on their OC3.<p>

Please email me privately with your response and the kind of site you'd like to host.<p>

BTW, I am aware there are security concerns. This will all depend on what types of sites people are interested in running.<p>

Thanks.<p>

Matt
