I didn't get very far at that point, but with the new capabilities of F6 and MR, I gave it another shot and came up with something similar to what you describe.  It doesn't generate "inline" links to other pages (yet), but when creating a new page, you have the option of linking it to to the current page. All "child" pages for a given page are listed in a column.  As with swiki, there is no security, which is something I'll have to add before we could use it in our district.<p>

I'm wondering how similar Manila is to what I'm playing with?<p>

The my simple prototype is at:<p>

<a href="http://www.hawthorn.k12.il.us:81/hlcweb/">http://www.hawthorn.k12.il.us:81/hlcweb/</a><p>

It has a bunch of sample pages I created, but nothing else, and is still rough around the edges.
