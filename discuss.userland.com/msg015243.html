Remember when your Manila site was empty.<p>

We're going to need a lot more functionality for pictures in the real world. Little tweaks like moving things around is not going to fix anything.<p>

Aside from that, there's a simple way to get the functionality you want. <p>

Jump to the Create A Picture page on your site, upload a picture, hit the Back button, upload another picture, etc.<p>
