As others have mentioned, there is definitely a JDK port for Linux.  There are also Java IDEs for Linux, including one provided by <a href="http://www.sun.com/forte/ffj/ce/download.html">Sun</a> itself (used to be Netbeans).<p>

As far as browser support for Java.  The Netscape 6 Beta is actually the first (and only?) browser to "natively" support JDK1.2-specific applets.  This is done using the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/oji/">OJI</a> API that allows the browser to be independent of the JVM and vice versa.  Granted, this is not yet production-ready technology, Mr Lyda obviously didn't make much of a research effort for his article.<p>

Flame bait indeed.
