I've seen this from both the dynamic userland hosted sites (when the traffic gets bad) and my own webedit server (when I had a crappy dialup link)<p>

I _think_ I've only seen this from windows servers but I may be wrong.  At one point I think I had this tracked down to windows reporting that the tcp connection had a -10000 series error. (resource temporarily unavailiable)  This would only happen between chunks, due to the way that the data sending function was written. <p>

It would be interesting to see if adjusting the chunksize changed this. I no longer have a slow modem connection, so I can't really simulate this with my equipment.<p>

(( as an aside, it would be interesting to set up a squidcache as an accelerator on the local net where a frontier server was running. Use a large chunksize to send the whole page to the cache, from there any slow link can be dealt with using the cache, which is going to be using a better tcp sending apparatus than frontier has. I wonder if the userland's cobalt cube has squid installed?)) <p>
