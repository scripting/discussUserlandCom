Yes there is. I've been down that road before, see the <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5871">sour grapes</a> stuff that people give to me about Frontier vs AppleScript. There's no way I'm leading here. This is training. Learn how to be fair to developers. Mac users, as a group, are not fair. I'm not taking the bait. No integration without an API from Apple. That's firm.
