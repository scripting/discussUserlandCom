I don't know much about COM, DOM, etc., so if those are key, I'd need a quick orientation on those.<p>

To view it from the other direction: draw a picture of the current set of technologies out there, and then show how Frontier fills key gaps to hook them up and allow all kinds of powerful solutions.<p>

I'd be excited!<p>
