I haven't used My Userland much, and I was just messing with it some this morning and couldn't get this to work.  I'd push exclude, and the channel page would reload--no confirmation of the action.<p>

Returning to the home page (reloaded) and still found the channel's entries in the news stories list.  Is this 'cause prefs are spread around machines now and not getting updated?<p>

News stories page could be real nice if I could exclude the movie poster and NJ jobs, etc. that I have no interest in.<p>

Also, interface-wise, this feature should also be a check box on the channel selection list (for favorites), so you could set up all your channel prefs in one spot.  My $.02.<p>

thanks, g.
