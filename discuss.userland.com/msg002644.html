Any Java object can be registered as a COM object and called from JScript/VBScript on Windows. I've done this in several cases for ASP pages, and it works very well. I haven't tried yet in IE, but I guess it works the same way as in ASP. <p>

This would be cool because with more or less the same code you could have an applet/LiveConnect solution for Netscape and a COM/ActiveX solution for MSIE. I don't have the time to do this right now, but I can post some hints if there's interest. Otherwise I guess I would try it out next weekend.<p>

Does anybody know if IE on Mac supports ActiveX objects written in Java? I know it doesn't support LiveConnect to talk to Applets.
