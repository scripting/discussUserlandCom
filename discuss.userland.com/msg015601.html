I think it would be really useful to apply collaborative filtering to a full set of weblogs, like the set presented at my.userland.com. Technology like Net Perceptions' applied to my.userland.com would let me find the blogs that were rated high by those with the same interests as me (judging by their ratings of other blogs similar to my ratings). Yes, the set *is* getting large enough where this would be useful -- maybe not yet, but with the growth I'm seeing, it'll be there soon!<p>

I'd like to see this combined with one other major change to my.userland.com: let me create my own view of the incoming blog items.  For example, I'd like a view that shows 3-hour chunks of only my top-rated blogs, with a "more" link to show me the lower-rated blogs if I have more time to spend scanning news.  Even without the collaborative filtering, this could be done by letting me alone rank my selected blogs.<p>

What do you think?
