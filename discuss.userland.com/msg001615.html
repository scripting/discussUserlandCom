playing around with the libGD extension under WinNT i found a strange bug . i wrote a responder which calls first a libGD-routine to draw a gif with the parameters delivered via http within the searchArgs-variables and then returns a html-page that shows the gif that was just created a few milliseconds before. 
the strange thing now is that the responder-call via http works just the first time. Every second time frontier crashes.
when i call the responder without the libGD-call a thousand times there is no problem. when i call the libGD routine directly a thousand times there is also no problem.
it just happeens when the libGD routine is called from inside the responder call.<p>

for me there seems to be a serious problem using frontiers betty interface together with embeded dll-extension-calls.<p>

maybe someone is able to help.
