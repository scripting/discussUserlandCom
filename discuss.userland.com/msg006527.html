I like DW, personally, but don't really have anything against GoLive, except MAYBE that it's a grid-based editor.  All of the code I've seen come from other people using CyberStudio was very very bloated.<p>

I've heard that GoLive has better WebObjects support than DW, so now that it's available on both platforms, I might take a look at it.<p>
