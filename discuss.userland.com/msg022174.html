Today is no exception. <br><br>	Hey, why not do something out of character? Why be ordinary? Why always be the same?<br><br>	If I change does that mean I don't love you anymore?<br><br>	So many people define themselves, or their Net <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=personae">personae</a>, by what they are opposed to.<br><br>	Why not try being in favor of some of the things we are opposed to?<br><br>	I could decide to see things from the point of view of a patent abuser. Hmmm. My name is so-and-so and I want to trick you into thinking I'm a great inventor. So I'll take out a lot of patents and sue everyone, and even when I lose I'll appeal endlessly. Years after I'm dead, with buildings named after me at Harvard and elsewhere I'll still have been a fool who wasted his life trying to convince people I wasn't a fool. <br><br>	I tried posting a message on a mail list this evening that pointed out that there's something pretty interesting going on in Mac OS X. Now the people who are opposed to Macintosh must think I've lost my mind. <br><br>	I bought a delicious beverage today called <a href="http://www.oregonchai.com/mmm/product_originalrtd.html">Original Chai Tea Latte</a> from Oregon Chai. I'm drinking it right now. Their slogan is "Nirvana To Go." It's very tasty. How could I say no to a drink with such a <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=catchy">catchy</a> slogan?<br><br>	Kleiner-Perkins whiz-bang-man, Vinod Khosla <a href="http://www.herring.com/index.asp?layout=story&channel=10000001&doc_id=620019262&rh_special_report_id=">provides</a> air cover for our friends at KnowNow. "Real-time computing." <i>Aha!</i><br><br>	I still think it's funny that the initials RDF stand for Reality Distortion Field. <br><br>
