Now that it looks so pretty, I'm starting a rewrite of the home page. It's long overdue. ";->" <br><br>A theme is developing. Our witness is the cactus. On Scripting News he's in the desert southwest. On the Frontier site he visits Egypt (hence the pyramid hint I dropped a few days ago, heh heh he). I guess he'll be in the Philippines on the "Manila" site. Now, where else should our friendly cactus go? Fun and interesting places, I hope!<br><br><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,39544,00.html">Wired</a>: "Only Steve Jobs could turn a dreadful earnings forecast into an exciting and hopeful glimpse into the future."<br><br><a href="http://www.whump.com/www/xmlone/source/outline/outline.xsl">Bill Humphries</a> has an XSL stylesheet for "OPML" documents. <br><br>Adobe.Com has been <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$adobe.com">hijacked</a>.

Oy, I guessed that patents are at the core of their strategy. HTML email is a nice idea. I doubt if Zaplet invented it.<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/18/technology/18AGEN.html">NY Times</a>: "Still, Mr. Alsop insisted that he remained a big believer in the future of the Internet.

It's a <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/maps/submap.htm">Subway</a> Series. BFD. The Mets have a philosophy. The Yankees suck. But here's the thing I will always love about NY -- its unapologetic <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/18/opinion/18WED33.html">arrogance</a>. "New York City is back at the center of the baseball universe, where most of its citizens undoubtedly believe it should be." Now that's a philosophy. The Mets even in the bozo years, knew that we were in the eye of the storm, or the center of the universe, whatever you want to call it. When I went to high school I rode the <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/service/sevenlin.htm">7 train</a> to Grand Central, where I switched to the <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/service/fourline.htm">4 train</a> to the Bronx. So I am familiar with the route. I even rode it to the Bronx when the Mets won the World Series in 1969, when the Yankees fans were happy that the Mets won the series. Let me tell you this. No Mets fan will be happy if the Yankees win. The Times goes on to say "there is nothing inevitable about these Yankees." You got it babe.<br><br>To the many Mariners fans who read Scripting News, good job! An impressive team with lots of <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/stories/storyReader$818">spirit</a>. Someday the Mets will beat the Mariners in the World Series. I can feel it in my bones.<br><br>PS: I managed to get a *free* ticket to Thursday's game at Shea, it's game five, so it's pretty likely that unless the Mets sweep the Yankees I can go. Now it's a matter of finding the time. I think I can. NY here I come?<br><br><a href="http://www.faisal.com/quotes/u.html">From Faisal's quote file</a>, under U: "The true New Yorker secretly believes that people living anywhere else have to be, in some sense, kidding," attributed to John Updike.<br><br>
