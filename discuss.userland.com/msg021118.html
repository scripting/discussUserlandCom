<i>Can someone cite a single example where this happened? I just wonder how serious the problem is.</i><p>

This <i>has</i> happened, and it can be quite serious.<p>

In the early 1980's, the original BSD developers devoted many man-years to enhancing Unix. They gave all of this code to AT&T under an open source license (even though the term hadn't been invented yet). Much of this code showed up in System V Unix from AT&T.<p>

Many years later, AT&T turned around and sued the BSD developers. Their argument: Some AT&T code has contaminated BSD Unix, and you must not distribute any more of your code.<p>

Such gratitude. This is basically why the GPL exists.<p>

<b>An Example</b><p>

<i>Or I would make it clear the same code was available for free, and thank the seller for the free advertising.</i><p>

Here's a more complicated scenario, based on several real-world incidents.<p>

Consider GCC, a portable C compiler. GCC represents several hundred programmer-years of work, and untold millions of R&D. About half of this R&D was paid for by Cygnus, and the rest was donated by other developers. All this code is under the GPL.<p>

Let's say that SneakySoft decides to enhance GCC, and sell it as their own (proprietary) C compiler. They spend one programmer-year and $200,000 to port GCC to a new processor. They distribute the result under the "SneakySoft Not-So-Public License" (SNSPL) and call it "SneakyCC".<p>

Now, perhaps 1% of SneakyCC is original code. The remaining 99% of SneakyCC belongs to Richard Stallman, Cygnus, and several hundred independent developers. SneakySoft, though, claims that 100% of SneakyCC is proprietary.<p>

SneakySoft has just violated the GPL. The copyright holders of GCC forbid this particular use of their code, and SneakySoft ignored their request.<p>

Now, since Cygnus has very deep pockets (and RMS is friends with very good lawyers), SneakySoft will be getting a letter in the mail.  If history is any indication, SneakySoft will settle out of court, and release their 1% under the GPL (or withdraw SneakyCC from the market).<p>

If you don't like these terms, then you shouldn't enhance GCC. :-)<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
