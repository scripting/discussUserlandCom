This morning I got an email from Scott Cutler, who is Compaq's VP Advanced Technology and CTO.<p>

I gave him all the info I have, and told him they're "probably" coming to pick the computer up between 1 and 4. He asked for my order number and I gave it to him.<p>

I guess he's going to look into it.<p>

<b>Microsoft</b><p>

I just got an email from Carl Stork, Microsoft's vice-president for OEMs. <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/07/20/seattletripreport">I know Carl</a>, I've even been to a Seattle Mariners baseball game with him. I answered his questions and sent him my phone number.
