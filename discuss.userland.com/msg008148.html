If you want to try out the new way, use <a href="http://news.userland.com/">News.UserLand.Com</a> as your port of entry to DiscussionLand. The good news is that if you prefer the old way of DGing, you can keep coming in thru <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/">discuss.userland.com</a>, it still works.<p>

Lots of new stories on the Buck's <a href="http://www.buckswoodside.com/">home page</a>.<p>

Today's best link (so far) came from <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1019">Misnomer</a>, pointing to Scott Rosenberg's Salon <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/21st/rose/1997/12/19straight.html">piece</a> from 1997 about Microsoft and their claim that removing MSIE from Windows would cause the system to crash. Rosenberg says: "Removing IE actually <i>prevented</i> crashes." <p>

Salon: <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/tech/feature/1999/07/01/penguin/index.html">Penguin Wiggles its Flippers</a>. "We've had friends who have started companies, the most famous being Excite -- seven friends started this company, and within a year all of them combined owned less than seven percent, and most of the decision makers were these new implants from IBM and Sun. I just think that's incredibly boring."<p>

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/06/office2000">6/8/99</a>: "Like a scene from Microserfs, there were a couple of reps from Penguin Computing outside the event being young and enthusiastic and handing out leaflets. One was dressed in a penguin costume!"<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$8144">Yesterday</a>: "If you have a winner, the ones you leave behind will always make barking noises. The trick is to know when you have the winner, and stick with it and ignore the barking."<p>

NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/07/biztech/articles/04aoll.html">AOL Everywhere</a>. "An astounding 39 percent of the time Americans spend online is spent using services the company controls, 10 times the share of its nearest competitor, Microsoft."<p>

<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/bugathon.html">Mozilla.Org</a>: "There are many people who care about standards and would like to help our push at Mozilla.Org for compliance, but who aren't C++ engineers. Well, here's their chance--the Gecko BugAThon."<p>

Red Herring: <a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/1999/0703/news-aol.html">AOL and Prodigy woo users with hardware deals</a>. "The key right now is to get as many people as possible onto your site and worry about the business model later."<p>

<a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg070499.htm">Dan Gillmor</a>: "If you're wondering why the biggest companies in the technology universe are fervently wooing consumers to their instant-messaging services, consider the stakes. This is the beginning of a new kind of telephone system, but also much more."
