I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,<br>
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;<br>
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee,<br>
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.<br>
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,<br>
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;<br>
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,<br>
And evening full of the linnet's wings.<br>
I will arise and go now, for always night and day<br>
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;<br>
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,<br>
I hear it in the deep heart's core. <br>
