About "Macbird", it's probably not acceptance that's driving me, or maybe it is. <p>

Look what's happening with "XML-RPC", it's gaining acceptance now. Is that satisfying? You bet. It makes me want to do another one, because they plug together. With one you need the other.<p>

To do what I really want to do, which is create a truly independent developer space that's free from the giant companies and their idiocy and greed, we have to have a solid design tool.<p>

Now why do I want a free space to develop? If I actually get what I want will I be satisfied? I bet I won't, but I bet I grow when I get there. Another thing off my list of things to strive for.<p>

BTW, I really wasn't laying a trap for you, I was wondering if you and others had thought about this. That's all.<p>
