I've joined the developer's group and downloaded some of the docs and Toolkits.  They have a java API which is cool though the SameTime server runs only on NT.  <p>

A 45 trial download of the SameTime server is possible but an NT would be needed.  I work at a UNIX-only shop or I would set something up.<p>

As I read more, I'll post some thoughts.<p>
