It could go further. We could have a place where you enter a list saying "I can help do deals with XXX" and list fifteen companies. Some people have networks that go into interesting places at companies other than their own. <p>

Going even further, we could allow anyone, not just me, to do queries against those lists. You wouldn't get a person's list, but you would get their profile and know that the company you named was on their list. In addition to providing a great and unique networking resource for this community it would also be an interesting way to get to know who's out there.<p>

But there's a potential for abuse. What if someone from Microsoft registered saying "I can help do deals with AOL." Heh heh. You'd have to be careful about htat.
