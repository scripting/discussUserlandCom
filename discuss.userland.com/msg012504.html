When I stared my site up again (I'd had a version in '96), I decided to go the slow but steady route of building up my own database.  Some people suggested dredging other people's web sites, but I wanted to stay as close as possible to the primary data.  It has been slow, but steady.  Around six thousand listings showing up on the newsgroups I watch each day.  I've got a 2G database accumulated, but only coverying July 4th until now.  I'm kind of figuring that I'll need six months of data to see any real trends.<p>

It's a good think disks are cheap.
