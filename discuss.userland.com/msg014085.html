Perhaps this is a smart decision on your part, but messages left late in the day don't get responded to, discussions die overnight </i><p>

Please, I would really like this kind of feature.  It's the one thing I'm beginning to dislike as I read over two dozen different Manila discussion groups, having to click back to the calendar to see what was written late yesterday.<p>

(It's a little amusing too since I live on Eastern time and ETP sites live on Pacific time, so I find myself clicking that yesterday link often.)
