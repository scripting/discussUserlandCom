Over time that will get easier, and when we figure out what words we have to put on a website or in a whitepaper that makes the key turn for the bosses, we absolutely will publish them.<p>

We got a checklist from a potential user a few days ago. It was very long. Amazingly the combination of Manila and Frontier satisfied virtually every requirement on the list. It was an eye-opener.<p>

BTW, I think Frontier is inherently a back-door thing, given the pricepoint and ease of use. Like PCs it's easy to hide a Frontier license in the budget for pencils and cab fare.
