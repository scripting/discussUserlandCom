require beating up any webmasters: create <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/web/parsing.html">parsing browsers</a> that can access a <b>web-based database</b> where every website's peculiar url-syntax is decoded.  The <i>browser</i> can then figure out where to look for something that's moved, or how to turn a bad bookmark into a good one (at the time of bookmarking).  This should work even with infinitely idiotic sites.<p>

The same database would know how to format search-patterns, and where to look for archives, for new content, etc etc etc.<p>

(This is Bucky Fuller's theory of design-- don't change the user, change the environment.  His example was an endlessly useful trick for getting bees or wasps out of your livingroom-- don't run around swinging things at them, instead <b>close all the shades</b> except where a window or door is open to outside.  The light attracts them, and voila...)<p>

I also have some <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/web/awards.html">web design awards</a> in particular categories that don't yet include URL-format, but do mention that problem in passing.  Worst would be netsyn.com URLs, which have to be seen to be believed.<p>
