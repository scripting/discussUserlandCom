There's lots of kinds of power, send me a screen shot of your favorite radio program authoring software. The ones I've seen so far are missing two very central features, outlining and nesting playlists and linking to other playlists over the Web.<p>

No doubt there are ways the other software is more powerful than ours. The statement is accurate, as it stands. Always striving for perfection, and you can please some of the people some of the time.<p>

Happy huntin!<p>

Your host for this hour,<p>

DJ Dave of Radio UserLand<p>

PS: Why would you want to limit the number of female singers per hour? Just curious.<p>

PPS: I'm listening the Der Kommisar as I write this. The German version. Can you tell?
