To the extent the DG is an extension of Scripting News, I find it interesting... a sort of real-time Davenet.<p>

Recently I find myself skipping more messages on some topics and from some writers.  The flaming wastes everyone's time.<p>

I find myself following links from Scripting News, and from the many creative people who post to the DG. It helps me keep a fresh perspective.<p>

If the DG goes away, I'll survive.<p>

  Jeff.
