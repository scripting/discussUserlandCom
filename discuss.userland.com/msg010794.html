Have you?  fnorb is much simpler to use than you may think.<p>

But it's a horses for courses thing.  Most of the things I see people building with XML-RPC are pretty small scale.  Has anyone built anything substantial with XML-RPC that requires dynamic lookup, dynamic failover, multi-threaded servers, callbacks, etc.<p>
