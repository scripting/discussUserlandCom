Besides adopting Unix standards, adopt Unix philosophy. You keep saying the lack of a standard interface for Linux is a hinderance. I disagree. <p>

First, you don't get improvement without competition. It's software darwinism. Change has to be introduced via mutation, and then the good changes stick. The Linux GUI situation is healthy and desirable. Without the Mac, you don't get Windows 95. And without the internet, you don't get Windows active desktop (IMO, ugh) or the things Dvorak's showing of Windows 2000 (IMO, double ugh). The key is to have multiple influences, not just one, because that one can never be as innovative without outside help.<p>

Second, after a couple of weeks on the job, I take a look at what a new developer is doing with her tools. If the desktop and toolset has been personalized, I know that developer has experience and knows what she likes. She's taking a particular pride in her tools, just like every good carpenter has pride in toolmanship. If the desktop looks untouched, the developer is probably relying on getting by via screenshots, tutorials, and "Dummies" books. Worse, if she's using NT and hasn't downloaded replacements for notepad and telnet, she's probably not functioning at 100%.<p>

In an open environment, as long as they lead to maximum efficiency, the tools don't matter, standardizing the interface doesn't matter. Give users enough choice and they may use a window manager you personally don't like (even an OS I don't like), customize their screen and make it totally impossible for you to get around in it -- but if it works the way they want, they'll be productive, and that's all that matters.<p>

Finally, in a future of broadband web apps such as what you were picturing for Mail to the Future, I don't think standardization from app to app is going to be enforcable, or desirable. There will be some guidelines, but no set of engraved commandments. So requiring standardization in the window manager seems irrelevant.<p>

That's my long way of saying the Linux glass is half full.
