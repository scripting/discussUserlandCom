OK...my question. I'll be explicit...(it's either a reality distortion field, or a VERY complex threaded discussion...*grin*)<p>

1) In <A HREF="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10353">this message</A> you say...<p>

"but when you explain why I should like your scraping my site, that's plain disrespect. I'm right here. Please ask. Thanks for listening."<p>

The way I read that, you were asking him to ask you whether or not you like your site being scraped.<p>

2) In <A HREF="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10358">this message (a response within the same thread)</A> Ian explicitly asks the question...<p>

"Why don't you like your site being scraped? We use the scripting news RSS file and scrape the discussion group."<p>

3) In <A HREF="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10390">this message (later message within the same thread)</A> I asked if/when you were going to respond...<p>

"You asked Ian to ask whether or not you like your site being scraped. He has. Where's your reply?"<p>

How's that?<p>

Admittedly, Ian assumed the negative; rather than asking you whether or not you liking the DG being scraped, he asked why you didn't like it. <p>

I'll be interested in reading your reponse, in DaveNet or in the thread! This stuff is tangled, isn't it? Scrapings, and postings, and channels, oh my!! *grin*<p>
