I suspect that there are those at Apple (in addition to the many Apple users not officially part of the company) who do know about and respect Userland's contributions here.<p>

Clearly, Apple focused attention away from the ability of the Mac (at least under OS 9) to act as a server platform - despite the fact that there are quite a few of us who use it effectively just that way. I suspect that it has been a question of marketing focus.<p>

Perhaps with the advent of OSX and with the more recent (and continuing) success of the Mac platform Apple will broaden their focus.<p>

I'm an education user of Frontier/Manila and I have to say the the tools are extremely powerful in this environment - the main problem I've had is getting people to look beyond their limited view of how the web works to adopt a more forward-thinking view that understands the power of Frontier/Manila. <p>

I don't think this is an Apple-related problem at all - the same issue arises when I try to evangelize Windows users at my college. For many new users the initial conceptual leaps required to "get" Frontier/Manila are too great. I don't necessarily fault the product for this; it is just that the concept appears so much different from the "make page and upload" process that they have gotten used to.<p>

I'd love to be able to demo Manila for education users - perhaps at a conference where a roomful of people could experience the ease with which they can set up and manage their Manila sites.<p>
