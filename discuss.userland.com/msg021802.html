I understand why Salon is doing this, their market cap is <a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=saln&d=t">$21 million</a> and Vignette's is <a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=vign&d=t">$6 billion</a>. And with all due respect to Vignette, it's quite possible that Salon's software does more and does it better than Vignette's. However..<br><br>	The real value of Salon, as I have said in the past, is in their unique reputation for journalism that's Web-only. They have the best name, but others are catching up. Eventually content management software will be a deep and competitive category, priced in the professional software range, like PhotoShop or Quark XPress. At that point, it's hard to imagine that Vignette will be worth so much.<br><br>	In a few years the market will figure out that the Web is a publishing medium, and a great pub like Salon will be worth a lot more than $25 million. Sure they have an immediate problem to solve, to get more cash in to survive the crunch. It's possible that spinning out the CMS will do that. But please focus on the value of your journalistic name, longterm, imho, that will be worth much more.<br><br>
