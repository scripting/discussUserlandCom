I agree that HTML fails as a UI specification language.  The problem is that with the web, we want to mix interactivity with documents, and most attempts to shoehorn good UI design onto the web reduce its "document-ness".<p>

It would be nice if there were a standard, degradable, and easy-to-author UI spec language, and if it could coexist and compliment HTML and vice versa.  But I don't think putting more cruft on HTML is the answer.<p>

Nicer still would be if there were a single vocabulary for expressing the continuum that spans from highly interactive spaces all the way to static documents.  But I'm talking beyond my depth here.  Oh well.
