ScriptingNews is not the first, nor the last. But this weeks troubles with server connections at Userland highlights the problems with the scheme: If the redirect server won't respond to my request, I can't follow a link to another site without manually entering the URL in a location window (or editing it.) This defeats some one the beuaty and openness and "linkability" of the web.<p>
