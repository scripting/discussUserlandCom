Instead, I'm saying that Dave is the only one who insists that we should not be doing are work at all (or if we do it, we shouldn't call it RSS).<p>

I'm not against complaints about the new changes -- I want to hear them -- please, flame me all you want about it! Instead, I want people to provide criticism in the sprit of pushing the format forward (which is, I believe, what the people on syndication are doing). Dave, OTOH, has said in this forum that he'd like to see RSS make slower, more evolutionary changes.<p>

I don't want things to slow down -- I want them to speed up. But maybe because I'm a kid and I'm naieve.
