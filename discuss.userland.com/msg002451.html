The following script gets into the call then quits with a "500 unexpected EOF before status line seen" error.<p>

I'm not sure what's causing that error, the request seems to be correct.<p>

Frederik, what is ``status line'' the http lib is looking for when it gives the "500 unexpected EOF before status line seen" error?
