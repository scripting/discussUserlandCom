It's amazing what blundering companies can do when they don't know what's not possible. To use one of my favorite quotes: "You musn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when the blundered into Berlin in 1917".  <p>

So let them blunder and not get things. They may come across a gem. They've done it before.* In the mean time, the rest of us can do as if they don't exist. Or compete, whichever you prefer.<p>

There's nothing stopping me (or anyone else) from assembling $10k worth of linux boxen, a month of my time, and a fat pipe and doing an iDisk clone. I could even make it cross platform.  The biggest barrier to entry is the domain name. <p>

There's also nothing stopping me from doing a dancing elvis (a-la dancing hampsters) other than good taste and the firm belief that some lines just shouldn't be crossed.<p>

We're art a point in the net world where what is possible and what is not possible is not known. There is still time for wild ideas to happen. Go forth and create!  Do something interesting!  Maybe you'll build a better mousetrap (mousepad?), maybe a better mouse (round even!).  Maybe you'll crash and burn, be forgotten by history, and need a vacation. But next year, you can do it all again. <p>

*I own a newton. It's an interesting machine. I liked it, but it was just a little unwieldly. I just got a handspring visor. It's effectivly the same concept at 1/2 the size in every direction. The newton was just a few years and a lot of mass ahead of it's time.
