It seems the links it uses to point at matching pages are of the form redir.*<a href="./msg003450.html%3Fhttp:%252F%252F.html">?http://</a>.* which happens to be one of the regular expressions that comes, by default, with the ad-blocking utility I use.<p>

I now face the dilemma of (still) not being able to effectively use search.userland.com or reducing the effectiveness of my ad-blocker.<p>

I'm also left wondering why these redirection links are being used rather than direct links.  Is there some kind of feedback mechanism being used to improve the search engine's effectiveness?
