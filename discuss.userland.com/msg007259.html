My only real problem is that My.Userland.Com Defaults to a page which is <i>NOT</i> my portal page! I thought the whole idea was that on a portal the user has instant access to all the information they're looking for?<p>

I like having the recently changed channels available- great work! But please- could there be a preference for members which would allow them to specify whether My.Userland defaults to the changes page or thier favorites page?<p>

Nice work, Dave- I agree with James that the navigation/transitional elements work well.<p>
