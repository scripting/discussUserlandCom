I managed to change the runlevel and kill xeyes.<p>

I *don't* know the basics, or I know just some of them -- it seems like there are lots of basics. Not much is intuitive. But I'm learning, slowly.<p>

One more thing: every time KDE starts up, I get two Audio CD Player (kscd) windows, and two error messages boxes. "CDROM read or access error. Please make sure you have access permissions to /dev/cdrom"<p>

I don't want to listen to CDs through Linux, I don't care about the error, I just want to stop those cd player windows from appearing every time KDE starts.<p>

The broader question is -- where do I access those kinds of preferences?
