In other words, it is my <I>personal</I> opinion that these are still interfering with the original web page.  There's no <I>practical</I> difference between that system and Third Voice anyhow (the "connection" to a specific phrase in Third Voice not working all that well anyhow), so why should different standards be applied? (Obviously, that question has answers :-) )<p>

You can create a fairly continuous spread from cracking into the server and changing things, to never looking at a page, and this is between Third Voice itself, and the hypothetical web site that allows you to type in a URL and view the comments about that target site.  Where's the line?  Beats me, but it's got to be around here somewhere...<p>

(yoohoo!  line!  here boy!  come here!  good little line!)
