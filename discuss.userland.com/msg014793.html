I'm not sure if this is exactly what you meant, but I find your writing well-adapted for the web because it's sparse, it isolates the main points, and puts them on their own lines. <p>

While you don't use bold in your writing, the way each main idea has its own space is pretty powerful, and well-suited to reading on-screen.<p>

The best form matches the content. For me, this has everything to do with user interface.
