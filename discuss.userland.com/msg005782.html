There is a difference between Swedish neutrality and Swiss neutrality.<p>

Austria and Switzerland are bound by law to neutrality.<br>
Sweden folows neutrality as a policy.<p>

It was a very nice ballancing act in Scandinavia - you had NATO Norway, neutral Sweden and very friendly with good cause with the USSR Finnland.  Sweden was a nice buffer. Sweden kept things civil.<p>

For Sweden neutrality is only a <i>concept</i>, they are free to take sides.  Switzerland, Austria and the like don't have that freedom.  Neutrality is part of their constitution and recognized by international law.<p>

(for more info on Neutrality policy, look up Dr. Prof. Hanspeter Neuhold at the Universit&auml;t Wien (Austria)....he taught me everything I know about it.)<p>
