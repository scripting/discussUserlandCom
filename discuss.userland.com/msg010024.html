They are called COMPUTER DEALERS.  Or VARs, or other names.<p>

Turn-key computer installation is a service you can buy, like anything else in this heah great country of ours.<p>

It sounds like you want the hardware manufacturer to play VAR for free, and declare war if they don't go along.  Good luck.  While you're having this great battle, other companies are getting their work done on properly installed computers (including Compaqs and including NT, which I agree is not always zipless)
