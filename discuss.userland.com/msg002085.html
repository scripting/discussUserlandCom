That's an interesting idea! It might work. I wonder if we did that if Allaire would agree to support our RPC wrapper? That seems like a reasonable give-and-take. However, I'm not sure how it would work at a higher level. How would you tell betty.rpc.client that the server you're talking to wants its params encoded as WDDX not as XML-RPC object serialization? It seems easy enough to handle on the server side. Are there clues in their structure that identify it as WDDX? Still diggin.<p>
