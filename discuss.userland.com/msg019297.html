I love the idea of radio.userland but personally can't
listen to music while I work. That and the lack of high-speed
Internet here in the boonies keeps me from using Napster more frequently.<p>

The real point of this note, though is that I was going to
comment on a topic in radio.userland that I felt that it might
be of value to all of userland - specifically a comment on
why Dave wold persist in flogging Frontier in the face
of a real cash loss.<p>

Anyways, I bemoaned the fact that the discussion groups <i>within</i>
userland don't seem to be heirachical - like an outline. I should
be able to "subscribe" to the diiscussion heirarchy at multiple
points to be able to filter stuff I might be interested in.<p>

This is not a big deal when you have only a few groups, but userland
will grow. Look at radio.userland - probably two months from
conception to birth, and the next one will probably be shorter.<p>

Not one to criticize without providing a better (IMHO) model, I'd invite everyone to look at <<a href="http://www.lugnet.com">http://www.lugnet.com</a>> a LEGO enthusiast website I've mentioned before. Check out the heirarchical newsfeed/email/web browsable discussion lists and you'll get an
immediate sense of how powerful this discussion group software is.<p>

In fact, it is so easy to use that you don't even see it - now that's an elegant design.<p>

Cheers, Ralph Hempel - P.Eng.
