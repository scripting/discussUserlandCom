I see Frontier reaching ~5-10% of those sites, though. Let's say 1/2 million sites buy into Frontier/Linux, just to keep Dave motivated... :-)<p>

OS X is ALSO the future of the MacOS. Barring major disasters, Apple by this time next year will be shipping over 1 million OS X boxes per quarter, with about 10 million existing users able to upgrade to it. How many of those will use Frontier to help drive their small/medium office servers, list servers, etc. and to do basic scripting? Keep in mind that this is the market that got Frontier going.<p>

Dave, any guesses on your MacOS installed base now? Odd are, in due course, that's roughly your market for an OS X version of Froniter. Frontier needs to work for the people creating all of this stuff as well as for the hardware delivering it all.
