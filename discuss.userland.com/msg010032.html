Presumably because its faster more people can participate and egg on the other posters. :)<p>

Even with the increased volume and presumably the much higher hit rate on discuss.userland.com, its still faster even now. However, the question is: how much long before we're back to the old slow state? Is there more juice to be squeezed out of Frontier on this issue?
