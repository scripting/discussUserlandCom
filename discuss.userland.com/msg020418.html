But you know, the demonizing of Stallman is getting tiresome.  I think we all get your point, although I hesitate to speak for everyone.<p>

This is the problem with what's going on.  We don't need more demonizing.  We need to understand both sides.<p>

We've heard it.  GPL Bad!  Stallman Bad!<p>

Now let's try to get everyone talking, instead of pointing out everyone's bad points.<p>
