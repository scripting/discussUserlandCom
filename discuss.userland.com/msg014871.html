What this means is that you are connection from an outside network, and are trying to send mail through a standard stmp server to users outside the network. <p>

This is how spammers do their work. They find web servers that allow for relaying, and use them to send messages to lots of people outside the network.<p>

So if you are connecting from outside the network, a good mail server will only allow you to send mail to people in your domain(s) (only to people with @userland.com addresses).<p>

The ways around this are to find the mail server on the net you are using, and send mail through it.
Or send mail through a web based interface at userland (the mail originates from the web server within the userland net, so it works.
