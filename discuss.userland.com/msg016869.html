None of their devices really work that way.  The rep on the phone said the entry into even close to that is the Document Centre 220ST starting at about $12,000.  It can do "scan to file" which would allow it to scan an image and place it directly on a shared volume on the network.<p>

I have also found the HP Digital Sender <a href="http://www.pandi.hp.com/pandi-db/prodinfo.main?product=digitalsender8100">8100C</a> & <a href="http://www.pandi.hp.com/pandi-db/prodinfo.main?product=digitalsender9100">9100C</a> Series<p>

These units which run about $1,200 for the 8100C and about $2,900 for the 9100C seem to be much closer, though they use PDF or TIFF as there formats (rather then GIF or JPEG).  The 9100C series has the advantage over the 8100C in that it is a 100 Base-TX as well as 10 Base-T and it also sends JetSend-enabled devices, PC desktops, and network printers (color or black and white).<p>

Sending to a "PC desktop" seems the same as the Xerox at a fraction of the cost and with 100 Base-TX will be very fast.<p>

Does anyone have any experience with these devices?<p>

Thanks in advance,<p>
