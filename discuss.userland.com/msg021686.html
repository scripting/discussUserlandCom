He has burned through $300,000 in the last six months trying to get a new company off the ground, and he hasn't got much to show for it. He has no product, no revenues, no customers, no profits, and no hope of seeing any in the near future.

There's a rumor that a few weeks prior to the election in a desperate attempt to win, Cheney will resign because of a trumped-up heart problem or potential 'threat to his health.'  Then either John McCain or Colin Powell will be asked to come on the ticket and save the party.

Joel is a good man. Most states allow employers to add non-competes to employment agreements, that's basically slavery. One of the cool things about California, unless there's substantial renumeration, non-competes are unenforceable. I know because I had a non-compete once, when I sold my company to Symantec. They paid me a full salary while the non-compete was enforce. Not a bad deal, to be paid an exec salary for puttering around the house. Now it's different in Washington State, and I understand that non-competes are the usual thing at Microsoft. I'm surprised that the entrepreneurial employees at MS put up with it.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.sfbg.com/nab/press.html">Bay Area Guardian reporter</a> ejected from NAB convention in SF.
