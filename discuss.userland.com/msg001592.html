"Does each VBScript run in Frontier get it's own Script Control instance, or do they share one? If they share one instance, you should be able to share objects between threads."<p>

Each thread gets its own instance -- or else it wouldn't be multi-threaded. Each instance of the Script Control can only execute one script at a time.<p>

Sharing objects sounds nice, but I think in practice you'd get subtle, hard-to-track-down bugs due to collision and interference.<p>

You can of course put any scripts you want in the user.com table -- if you want to share data between threads, just store the data in Frontier. Viewed a certain way, this is what Frontier is all about, storing data and content and sharing it between different threads and scripts. That doesn't change just because you're using VBScript.
