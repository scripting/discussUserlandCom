I'll explain later when it's done.<p>

As for the mechanism, it's XML-RPC. It's open, any tool that supports XML-RPC, be it a graphics editor or HTML editor or JavaScript editor, whatever, can be linked into the editorial system. <p>

That's not actually such a big leap, since Frontier supports XML-RPC, and Frontier can connect up to content tools on the Mac via Apple Events, and (soon) via COM on Windows.<p>

Of course we'd like Adobe, Macromedia, Metacreations, Cyberstudio, et al to directly wire in thru XML-RPC. But even if they don't, there will be WebDAV. And COM and Apple Events.<p>
