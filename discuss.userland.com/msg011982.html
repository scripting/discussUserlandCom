AOLServer is a great example. It's more evidence that Open Source won't free us from an industry that's dominated by marketing. (Even though the Apache Group doesn't have an official marketing department, it still gets a disproportionate amount of press, which is the same thing in my mind.)<p>

I don't want to sound like I'm down on Apache; it's fine software. But generalizations that the best software wins in an Open Source environment are not true, just like so many other generalizations about Open Source.
