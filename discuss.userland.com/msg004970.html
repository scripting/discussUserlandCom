You ask excellent questions.<p>

One thing to note -- it's not necessary to put anything in the system.paths table. (And I recommend you don't try it yourself.) Any top-level table in a gdb is accessible by name.<p>

In other words: say you've created a suites.root, and you moved your copy of suites.states into that gdb. To call states.looper, it's the same call: states.looper (). It doesn't matter that it's in the suites table or in suites.root.<p>

It's worth reading the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tree$2.6.6">Guest Database Q&A</a>.<p>

You could run an experiment: copy all your suites into suites.root, then empty out your suites table. Do all your suites work as before? I bet most if not all of them do.
