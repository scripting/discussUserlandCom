Bookmarking media is difficult as it is.  You'd still be able to bookmark the page on which the media is located, so that's OK.<p>

You'd use the CGI script and output the type of content you want to serve via the MIME stuff that you can set.<p>

For HTML pages, referer is enough, I think, this just gives additional security for importent things.  As Jim alluded to elsewhere, this is too processor intensive to put on all content.<p>

Options, options, options.  No panacea, but lots and lots of simple, effective options.  That's the point.  To make something that isn't fakeable, as for some [management] people, the <I>possibility</I> that somebody might fake it is enough to still go to court over (which is the point I'm trying to make; there's <I>no</I> need to go to court, shouldn't even be a need percieved).  This option has tradeoffs, so does any other.  But pretty much any desired security can be obtained, one way or another, or by combining approaches (like CGI+Cookies).
