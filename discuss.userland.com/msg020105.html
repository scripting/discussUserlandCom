Sort of. :-)<p>

The GPL (and the "Lesser GPL") are fairly definitive. But the X/BSD/MIT/etc licenses are used by many major projects: XFree86, FreeBSD, sendmail, bind, and so forth. Perl, Python and Apache all use fairly similar licenses, too.<p>

So if you think the GPL is too restrictive, you're not alone.<p>

<i>The GPL recitals got me really angry, such disrespect for my profession. </i><p>

Same here, actually. It was really angry for about two years, until I first used RMS's software on a regular basis. If he hadn't written so much good code, I would never have forgiven him for some of his remarks.<p>

It's weird, isn't it? I've forgiven another programmer for feeling that way, but I'd never forgive a user who made the same arguments.<p>

Full disclose: I've worked briefly with Stallman, I respect him, he makes me very uneasy, and I disagree with him. Yes, I <i>am</i> confused. :-)<p>

<i>And now I wonder about developers who release stuff under the GPL. "They seem like honorable people. How could they agree with the recitals?"</i><p>

Do they?<p>

In my experience, not everyone who uses the license accepts the politics. The GPL tends to protect developers from outright exploitation, and I know many people who use it for that reason alone. <p>

<i>I'd like to be able to support open source, have a consensus agreement, and make releasing open source a total no-brainer for people who want to do it.</i><p>

Do you just want a "no-outage" license? Or did you have something special in mind?<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
