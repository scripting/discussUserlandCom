<i>That's how it looks through Netscape-tainted goggles.</i><p>

I'm not very pro Netscape since I left Netscape in April.  (I was not terribly pro Netscape when I worked there.  I can as easily say unflattering things about folks associated with Netscape. Put up a photo of a Netscape panel and see what I have to say.)<p>

I confess to wearing non-Microsoft tainted goggles.  I don't know any of those folks personally, so it's hard for me to know how good my guesses might be.  However, I've been exposed to a very large PR data set for Bill Gates in the last 10 years, and feel more sure of my ability to avoid random guesses in that area.<p>

I appreciate that Brad points out my perspective must have a bias, the same as everyone else's.  It is simply more difficult to figure out for random folks with an unknown background.
