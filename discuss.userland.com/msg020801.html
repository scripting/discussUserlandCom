There's no rule that strong language can't be used here, or that half-baked theories can't be presented for evaluation. <p>

BTW, the "wienerboy" thing is Chuck Shotton's invention as far as I know. Chuck is doing some incredible things with RSS. I've known him for a long time, he did WebSTAR which was the defacto Mac web server in the mid-90s. <p>

Another btw, you might want to check out the FoRK list, which is not an open list as far as I know, I think you have to be invited on. I've been impressed that they have strong opinions there, using colorful language, but seem to never devolve into flames as other lists do. As I've gotten more comfortable on that list, I've loosened the restrictions here on what is and isn't considered a flame.<p>

The regulars here know all about this. As often is the case, an outsider comes in and drops a highly judgmental and censorous comment in the middle of an otherwise fun and productive discussion. Please reserve judgement until you get a sense of what's going on here. You can't get that from one or two messages out of context. <p>

I guess the bottom line is this: your values don't rule here Tim.
