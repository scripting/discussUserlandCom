In an Apple history timeline, <A HREF="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-315568-0.html">CNET News.com</A> says it's from April 1976:<p>

"Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs form Apple and show off the Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club, Stanford University."<p>

The only "credit" I've seen was on this <A HREF="http://www.datavista.com/learn/img_toc.htm">Arts and Photos Credits page</A> for datavista.com:<p>

Image courtesy of "Apple Computer, Inc."<p>

Not sure if the picture in question was included, but the Stanford Libraries might be able to help you find the photographer as Apple donated their historical collection to them a few years ago.<p>

Best version of the WozJobs photo I've come across:<p>
