I'm working on a system that runs as 2 inetd daemons (smtp inbound, and pop outbound) as well as a web interface running behind the main responder. All of the mail is stored in guest DBs,<p>

Currently, it's in beta. It's not really behind main responder yet (at least on a non development machine) and administration is not quite there yet, but the smtp and pop has ben burned in pretty well. I've been subscribing to 4 or 5 mailing lists with it to keep a load coming in.  Recently I've been indexing the mail using the search engine.<p>

If the office isn't too big (and you're not scared of beta software), this might be what you're looking for, or at least a good start. If not, this might be a pretty good framework for doing a web interface to an external pop server. I think it would only be a day or two on my part to get a working proof of concept for that.<p>
