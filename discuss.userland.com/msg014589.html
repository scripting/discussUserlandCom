My brain feels the same way, explaining the <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14552">message</a> I left last night for Dori re Bill Gates.<p>

I think finding a hilltop for Be must be the top priority. Getting hardware OEMs to pre-install the OS seems like a total uphill struggle against a well-defended cathedral and a loosey-goosey bazaar.<p>

Remember that Be did a successful IPO, and their stock has gone up significantly since then, so they have the option of playing a longer term strategy now. Building around the Internet is the only way to go. I think a flashy user interface backed up by a lean server is a good idea for Old Be.<p>

I just left a voicemail for Benoit Schillings. I'm going to try to get down there in the next few days with my new digital camera and get the scoop first-hand.<p>

Postscript: Be stock is way way down today. <b>-26 percent</b>.<p>
