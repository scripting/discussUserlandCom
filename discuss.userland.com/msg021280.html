there's always a but &#150; or at least a butt, which may easily be me<p>

a couple of caveats about the ebb &amp; flow of our cute, little industry  :<p>

<ul><li>it's a subscription, a service as you say, which allows for a lot more differentiation &amp; combination of features end-users care about &#150; most importantly, imho, the subscription model also offers a very important distiction to users in choice of top-level environment/platform/suite as well as software's more granular features, like its openness, scalability, <strong><em>freedom</em></strong>, etc.<br>
<br></li>
<li>the problem is that the hard drive is not in the lynchpin position any longer &#150; maybe the CD &amp; DVD got a glimpse of glory from <strong><em>business</em></strong>, but users like the network a lot more, and there's no sense in limiting their use of it illegitimately: it's a losing proposition, which business must understand</li>
</ul><p>

there are certainly issues that are bigger sticking points to me, e.g. copyright, patent &amp; intellectual property &#150; subscription &amp; distribution are virtually unhindered by comparison except for those self-same issues &#150; wonderfully circular, isn't it?  &nbsp; ...or perhaps it's just the modularity of our universe<p>

a couple other notes :<p>

<ul><li>I won't pretend to fully understand what <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21270">Russell was trying to say</a> at the top of this thread... but I do know that the prior history in a discussion is <em>at least</em> as important as the ensuing responses &#150; so it needs better representation in the interface, which really begs standard treatment of layers in browsers<br>
<br></li>
<li>delerious --> delirious<br>
<br>
but that would happen 1/1000 as often if we got this distributed software paradigm sorted out enough that it connected, now, wouldn't it?!?<br>
<br></li>
<li>the world <strong><em>is</em></strong> in a delirious pyramid scheme mode, but with <strong><em>information, ideas &amp; knowledge</em></strong>, which are neither currency nor physical entities</li>
</ul><p>
