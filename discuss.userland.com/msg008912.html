I've been diggin pretty heavily lately, and suddenly I've got a bunch of macros and scripts that call html.getPageTableAdress() throwing a scripterror that "params" isn't defined. I did a search through Frontier.root looking for "params" and couldn't find anything that looked remotely connected. Some things work fine: I have a page with two "imageRef" calls- one works fine, the other blows up.<p>

I'm going to export whatever I can out of Frontier.root and restore from an old copy.<p>

Anyone have any idea what I broke?<p>

UPDATE: I think I've found the answer, but I'm not sure what to look for to fix it. I've got a macro which calls an rssChannel-style script, which in turn fetches a url from frontier itself. This was fine, until, I try to then process a macro afterwards. I think the pagetable is getting stomped on by the script which renders and delivers the xml. What should I be doing to keep my pageTables seperate?<p>
