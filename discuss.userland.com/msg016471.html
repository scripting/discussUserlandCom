In the script, the call to webserver.util.parseHeaders is commented out and replaced with a call to string.httpResultSplit. </i><p>

That would be my contribution to the code.  Not necessarily a defense, but an explanation.<p>

There was a reason for that at one point, although the reason may be lost to the ages. I suppose that's what comments are for....<p>

<i>yet you don't set any variable to the returned value of the call</i><p>

That's because the body will be empty. Note that what is being passed in is the headers, + enough blank lines for the match to know that there are a valid set of headers, and extra info.  I did this to reduce the amount of text slinging around in the case where the message was large. (since the headers are limited to < 1k or so)<p>
