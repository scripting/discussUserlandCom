There are hooks to lots of different client platforms, there are at least a couple that should work for an XML-RPC layer.<p>

It should be possible to get this transparently working with webedit so that no one knows that it's not frontier on the other end, unless you wanted to use the advanced features like rollback or snapshots. (Of course, that's why it would be so useful)<p>
