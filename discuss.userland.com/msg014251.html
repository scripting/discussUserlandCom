<i>I'm making an issue of this so our Mac users understand that this will inevitably mean Windows-only features in Frontier and in Manila.

Hmmm. I can&#180;t quite see the connection to Apple offering web services. And as a paying customer of Userland Frontier, I don&#180;t like this notion at all.<p>

Are you saying that in order to counteract Steve Jobs trying to take control you will hand control over to Bill Gates instead?<p>

Or do you simply mean that (sadly) Mac based browsers seem to fall behind in adopting W3C standards? What could Apple do to prevent that, short of developing a browser themselves? Is helping MS to do Explorer 5 for Mac and AOL/Netscape do their Mozilla thing not enough?<p>

Why would you want to move Manila to Windows-Only? Next year, there are going to be millions new surfers that DREAM of Manila. (Ever heard of Sony Playstation 2? I don&#180;t think they run MS Frontpage and Windows is also not there. A good market for Manila Sites!).<p>

I hope you reconsider. It would help to understand what your issues are if you could state a little bit more detailed what you want to do that can not be done on a Mac.<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
