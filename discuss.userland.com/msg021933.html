<P>Voter turnout only up 1% from last year, according to CNN.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; It's interesting to note <EM>The New Republic</EM> features an article today about on-line voting, as does the microsoft.com homepage.&nbsp; Both articles say basically the same thing -- good potential, but bridging the "digital divide" will be important.</P>
<P>To Boaz, regarding the electoral college debate and the fact that America does not represent a pure democracy:&nbsp; This was a very intense debate at the founding of the country, which is technically a "republic" or a "representative democracy".&nbsp; Certain founding fathers, such as Jefferson, believed in a pure democracy, while others belived in a more representative form, presumably because the "common man" could not be trusted to completely self-govern.&nbsp; Those opposed to Jeffersonian democracy were able to influence the structure of the system largely by arguing that the logistics of a pure democracy in 1776 conditions would be nearly impossible.&nbsp; Today (and especially with on-line voting), many of the structural/logistics arguments go away, but many are still wary of pure democracy.&nbsp; The future of democracy in America ought to be interesting...</P>
