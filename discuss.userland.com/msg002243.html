We actually have that in a more subtle way.<p>

When you click on a link produced by a search engine query you actually redirect thru search.userland.com. It records the fact that you, a sentient human being, picked this link in response to this query. It moves up in ranking as a result. Isn't that clever? And it required no more UI to confuse the user. That's an important part of it. I for one never have time to inform a search engine at a conscious level that I liked this one better than all the rest, so we snuck in a little heuristic to get the information from you without you even knowing we were doing it!<p>

Check it out. Here's a <a href="http://search.userland.com/default?m=25&s=1&q=white+boy+welfare">query</a>. Let your mouse run over the links, see they go back to search.userland.com. Isn't that funny?
