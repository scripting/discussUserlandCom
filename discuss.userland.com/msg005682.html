Besides the technology community losing one of it's bright lights, it hits uncomfortably close to home. I just lost my wife to breast cancer (three weeks ago today, as a matter of fact)...she was 36. While she was originally diagnosed five years ago, in the end, like Mark, it progressed very rapidly. <p>

My heart goes out to his wife and children (I have a 20-month old son myself). We can take comfort in the fact that they lived their lives fully, and that they're beyond any pain. <p>
