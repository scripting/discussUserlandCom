So these are actually new scripts you have developed in Python, and you are using XML-RPC to tie into your Frontier/NT platform? Where does Froniter leave off and Zope pick up in this new architecture? What is your basic philosophy for defining which proces handles which task?<p>

I am interested in developing in Frontier/Mac and deploying on Linux. I just want to be clear on the direction of Frontier deployment on Linux. I know you are working on actual Frontier deployment on Linux, using WINE. So someday I may be able to run my Frontier scripts and databases directly on Linux. COOL! If I want to deploy parts of my websites with Zope, I may do so with XML-RPC. ALSO COOL!<p>

Am I getting the big picture here?   -Erin
