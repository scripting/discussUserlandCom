That's what Netscape called them. Then comes MSIE, the second browser, and they call them Favorites.</i><p>

Netscape wasn't the first browser. Mosaic was the first <i>major </i> browser and it used the term bookmarks as well. Of course, there were many minor browsers before Mosaic (and even after Mosaic).<p>

In any case, from a historical perspective, bookmarks go back at least to the Symbolics Document Examiner from 1985. And yes, Symbolics used the term "bookmark" for the feature. The term appears 5 times in the index to my 1990 book "Hypertext and Hypermedia" so it was quite well established by then.
