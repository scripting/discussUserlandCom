Chronic lying. It's also about role models and the need for heroes.<p>

I have kids. I am concerned about honesty, and teaching them the value of truth. I grew up believing that the President was someone to look to, someone to aspire to become. I actually thought, at one time, that the President could be a hero. I still believe that the President could be someone we look to as an example. Not this one.<p>

If Clinton gets off, or gets off with a slap on the hand, what signal does this send to the kids growing up now? That it's just fine to be a liar? <p>

That truth, honesty, and doing what's right pale to what one can get away with? This plants bad seeds for what kind of country we have, and will, become.<p>

"But Dad, why should I tell the truth? Bill Clinton lies and gets away with it, why can't I?" What is a parent to do? What is to become of a nation that allows, without sanction, this kind of deceit as modus operandi?<p>

I cannot believe a thing Clinton says. He has no veracity, no authority. I voted for Clinton. He has been a terrible disappointment. He needs to go away, but I am quite afraid he will stick it out to survive a 55-45 party-line Senate vote.<p>

Clinton knows not truth, honor, or shame. At least Newt knew when to walk.
