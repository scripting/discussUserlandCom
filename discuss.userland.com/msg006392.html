Ernie Prahabkhar (sp?) - the marketing guy - offered scenarios involving a free runtime, $50-100/seat license, similar to now, and some large ($10-40K) per-year license for unlimited deployment. The entire room raised their hands at the possibility of the first; almost everyone at the second, and I remember about 2-3 people at the third. Of course he wasn't promising anything, but it looked like it could at least be some ammunition to take to Steve.<p>

Jim - nice meeting you at WWDC.<p>
