both the government and the public opinion (who often
tend to be out of sync these days) support the nato
intervention.  the official line is the same as the
european union's: it's all milosevic's fault...<p>

but on the national level, there's also some serious
concern over the political consequences of this
intervention. it will most likely change the future
roles of both the united nations and the european
union in some, yet to be seen, way.  sweden is a
strong supporter of the UN (which proved itself to be
almost completely useless in this conflict), and a
somewhat reluctant member of the EU.  most swedes would
probably prefer a stronger UN and a weaker EU, but
this conflict may move things in the opposite
direction.<p>

<b>re: resettlement</b> -- this is probably one of the main
reasons why europe is so united on this one; no
european country is prepared to handle more than just
a handful of kosovars, by various reasons (when UNHCR
asked for help placing 100,000 refugees, finland offered
to take fifty!).<p>

so if milosevic is allowed to implement his plan to
build a Greater All-Serbian Empire on top of a pile
of rubble, we'll end up with millions of people living
in refugee camps in the poorest corner of europe.<p>

and that would be a Really Bad Thing, in many ways.<p>

<b>re: my earlier post</b> -- I should perhaps mention that there
have been attempts to "blame it all on the americans", but
they seem to have fizzled out.<p>

besides a heavily criticized appeal to stop the nato
aggression, signed by some 150 mostly left-wing intellectuals,
and a few rallies organized by exile serbs, there hasn't
been much visible opposition.<p>

partly because Godwin's Law works also outside the net:
in late march, I walked around a corner in central
Link&ouml;ping and ran into in a small pro-milosevic rally,
just when the speaker claimed that <i>"clinton is MORE
evil than hitler ever was, because at least the nazis
had an ideology"</i>.  bzzt.  end of thread.<p>

in addition, american officials are not very visible
in this conflict.  albright appears now and then,
but the daily nato press conferences are manned by
well-versed britons and spaniards, and we see lots of
pictures of aircraft and soldiers from various european
countries.  it's not the usual footage of US representatives
claiming that "our moral grounds are better than your moral
grounds" ;-)
