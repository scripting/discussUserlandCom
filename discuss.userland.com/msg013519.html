If you're a CSS developer, how have you been able to negotiate this minefield in your sites?  It seems that Netscape completely negates any benefits of CSS for me, since I am pretty sure that there will be one or two users that use Netscape, and I can be totally sure that reliance on CSS on my part will mean a lack of site visits on their part; some developers have even had to shut down their sites to Netscape users because they were sick of Netscape-related hate mail regarding machines that completely crashed when viewing parsable CSS.<p>

I'm pretty amazed by this; what it means is that, since I know my intranet users are on Internet Explorer, I am designing my intranet sites with CSS and IE in mind, and that basically means that Netscape is completely shut out from my network; I _cannot_ install it, since it plum won't work.<p>
