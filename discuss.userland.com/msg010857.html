Does anyone know of a standard XML DTD for time and location based events? I'm writing a system that will publish on the web a list of events happening on a certain day at a certain time in a certain venue, etc. Hopefully the end to this system will be syndicating this content, but I'd like to do that in a standardised form -<p>

So far, I've come up with the following example :<p>

<pre>
<eventlisting>
    <StartTime>09/09/99 11.00.00pm GMT</StartTime>
    <EndTime>09/09/99 11.30.00pm GMT</EndTime>
    <Venue>Ben's Bar</Venue>
    <ShortDesc>An evening of relaxing music</ShortDesc>
    <EventName>Chill Out</EventName>
</eventlisting><p>

</pre><p>

If Venue allowed for web links, TV channels, etc. Then, the rolling out of this standard would be an enormously powerful and far-reaching use of syndication. I could call up my home page which would be able, with a few XML-RPC calls to tell me what was on offer for my evening on TV, on the web, in my town, etc.<p><p>

Furthermore, such a system would be perfect for implementing Intranet calendar and diary systems for businesses or timetabling for schools. <p><p>

I don't want to reinvent the wheel, but if nothing sensible exists out there, I'd like some help to develop this standard in a robust and sensible way - if we could include the elements of categorisation suggested in recent messages, this would be better still.<p>
