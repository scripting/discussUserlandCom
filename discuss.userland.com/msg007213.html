Memory equal in both machines?<p>

Memory is a big thing. One grad I knew had a program that took a week to run (text processing, indexing algorithms and other relationships on netnews). On a new machine, it took 2 days. When half the machine memory was reconfiged as a file (eg the file was all in memory), it took 3 hours. This was a new alphaserver with 4 gigabytes of memory, and digital unix. Ah, the tricks you can use to tune performance.
