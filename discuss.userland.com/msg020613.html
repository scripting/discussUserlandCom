I expected the ads, that's how they make money, right? But moving them to the top is a page right out of <a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$122">Joel Spolsky's Book of Bad Things</a>. OK, that's not the real title, but it's what eGroups is doing.<p>

I'm not sure about the policy of advocating certain software here, but since I have no interest in this next pointer, I'll do it anyways.<p>

Todd Lehmann (whom I have met) probably has a lot in common with Dave Winer (whom I have not met). Todd is passionate about getting a community to discuss things, and has developed what is arguably the "friendliest place on the net" <a href="http://www.lugnet.com">LUGNET</a>.<p>

I know, I've mentioned it before, but <i>somebody</i> really ought to see if Todd is willing to sell his group discussion software. It is, bar none, the easiest to use discussion software out there. It is fully heirarchical (like an outline) and you can read and post via NNTP, email, or the Web. It's searchable, configurable, and everything else you'd want to do...<p>

Is there any other good discussion groupware out there?<p>
