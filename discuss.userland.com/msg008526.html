If there is a comprehensive overview of how everything works, I'd be glad to have someone point it out to me. Specifically, my questions are:<p>

1.  Why aren't my.userland.com and discuss.userland.com even mentioned on the www.userland.com webpage?<p>

2.  Do you have to register your site first in order to use the "weblog" feature of my.userland.com? If not, what is its use?<p>

3.  Are you supposed to enclose links and other information in a special format for the weblog editor or will the weblog editor automatically translate ordinary text -- i.e. "Good news site" <a href="http://www.news.com/">http://www.news.com/</a> into XML?<p>

4. Can the weblog editor be used to create an XML file offsite that can later be registered with my.userland?<p>

5. When I picked my favorite channels and pressed "submit," the web page just gave me my.userland.com/default. Then, when I went to Favorites, I got "no chanels selected." When I went back to Channels, it was as if I had picked no channels. I did this twice to make sure that the results (or lack thereof) were the same and indeed they were.
Any idea what I'm doing wrong?<p>

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.
