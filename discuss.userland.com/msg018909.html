Barring that, to not have a copy of AppleWorks or ClarisWorks is quite rare.<p>

But there are a few shareware apps out there for the Mac.<p>

As for FTP and and HTML editing, BBEdit Lite is the best editor, and Anarchie and Fetch are great FTP clients. All shareware. <p>

Upgrade to the full BBEdit and it will up/download via FTP right in the editor and has a great HTML tools. Even in this day of GoLive and Dreamweaver, many, many web folks exclusively use BBEdit. It's fantastic.<p>

I think there used to be a shareware starter kit for this, maybe by TidBits (the deliverer of so many good Mac things), but not in a few years...
