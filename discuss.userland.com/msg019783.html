Security comes from not being able to reference an object unless you've been given the random number.<p>In Freenet, files are referenced by large random numbers (secure hashes). The document is encrypted by another key. The person retrieving the document has both keys, but retrieves it by requesting the searchkey. People storing the document can't decrypt them, because they don't have the decrypt keys.<p>If you were to store a bunch of E objects on Freenet, you could use only those objects for which you have been given keys. Message-passing would consist of retrieving the objects via Freenet. This would work only as long as objects do not have to be unique, because Freenet makes lots of copies. Pretty big limitation, but still might be interesting for some things.
