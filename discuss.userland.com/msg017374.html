Having lived in Milan for almost a year, I'd recommend it, for a number of reasons:<p>

<OL>
<LI>Da Vinci's Last Supper - newly restored
<LI>See if can't get to see Inter or Milan play soccer! (not sure if the season's over yet -- might be)
<LI>The Galleria
<LI>The Duomo
<LI>La Scala -- if you line up at the right time you can get in for standing room for dirt cheap.
<LI>Tons of art museums with breathtaking treasures.
<LI>Fun getting around on the trams
</OL><p>

Verona is beautiful, as is Parma, Bologna, Florence, Venice -- isn't Carnivale around now?  The lakes in the north.  The coast near Turin - PortoFino(?) is very attractive.  Getting off the beaten track is always rewarding.  I never got the chance to see the south, so I can't really comment on that.<p>

Switzerland is alright, but even the log piles are tidy.  Austria is okay, but Vienna's a little too imperial for my liking - nice opera though.  South of France probably too touristy (that's a problem with Florence and Venice in particular).<p>

I've always been a fan of the <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com.au/dest/eur/ita.htm">Lonely Planet guides</a>.<p>

p.s. of course, as a Brit, I should note that you're welcome there too!
