* Make sure standard applets support it
  - Outlook Express, Internet Explorer, Media Player
* Provide useful libraries
  - able to easily write log files of what the script did
    or didn't do
  - change various control panel settings (eg. display resolution)<p>

The key is to make it useful to write tiny apps. This is what
will make WSH be used, which is good for everybody.<p>

I'd also like a nice development environment. Something like
Visual Basic Scripting Edition but it should come with the OS.
I'm sure Microsoft would have nothing against that :-)
though Dave Winer might :-(.<p>
