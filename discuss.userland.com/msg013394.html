I wrote earlier today with all kinds of questions.<p>

Please don't even read them now.<p>

I have just successfully installed Frontier 6.1 and am sitting here
astounded at how easy you have made it for even me.<p>

Where was the confusion?<p>

Where was the complexity?<p>

Where was the unanswerable question?<p>

NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.<p>

I was so thankful when the installation wizard's questions were somehow magically answered with no intervention on my part.<p>

It's not supposed to be like this ..<p>

It's not supposed to be so easy.<p>

You have set a new standard of user friendliness!<p>

Thank you!
