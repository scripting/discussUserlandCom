At least, I came up with one way of doing it. But it's much less friendly than Frontier's approach.<p>

I created a folder in the root directory called References.
That creates an index_html file.
I clicked on the Properties panel, and added a property called "Toronto".
In the text box for Toronto I typed in:
<a href="http://www.toronto.com/">Toronto.com</a><p>

In my regular page I call the URL like this:
And here you can find <dtml-var "References.Toronto"> too.<p>

When the page is generated, it turns that into a link called Toronto.com<p>

Methinks there is a more elegant way than my kludge. But it works.
