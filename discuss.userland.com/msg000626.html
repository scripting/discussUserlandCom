One way is to record the e-mail address during registration but
not use it in a mailto: link automatically. Instead, give the 
user the option of having just the name (no link) there. And if the user WANTS e-mail, link the name link to an input form like the
one used to post messages. Put a "cookie" in a hidden field to
identify the user, but keep the actual address secret. If the
user wants to reveal his or her address, he or she can just
reply to the message.<p>

This cuts out spammers very nicely. I build systems like this
for my clients in Perl on UNIX.<p>

As for working for Ballmer: Actually, I would have been working
for Gordon Letwin... on OS/2. Ballmer was just one of the 
gauntlet of interviewers I had to run. But the fact that such
a crazy man was high up in the company got me worried.<p>

Besides, I had already promised to do work for you. (Yep, that's
one of the reasons I passed that opportunity up: I'm one of those
silly people who actually tries to keep his word.) Would have
probably been filthy rich, though I probably would have left
the company on principle rather than participate in its
questionable business practices, just as Paul Allen did.<p>

Life in Wyoming with my sweetie is sweet. Wyoming is a fantastic
place: clean air, low taxes (no state income tax), low cost of
living, friendly people. I could afford a house here without
those Microsoft stock options. The University campus is right
up the street; that's where I met my wife. And the Internet 
runs through the back bedroom at a few megabits per second.<p>

Oh, and there's great rock climbing right up the road.<p>
