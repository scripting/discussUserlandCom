I've been spending too much time here arguing with Brett lately! :)  But the <a href="http://www.stuffeddog.com/speller/doc/rpc.html">XML-RPC interface</a> seems to work with most clients (interestingly, the Java client doesn't work... yet).  I guess I really need to find out whether it does what users expect, and what options I need to provide for.  I wrote a little <a href="http://www.stuffeddog.com/speller/doc/usertalk-rpc-test.txt">Usertalk script</a> to call it from Frontier/Radio Userland if you wanted to try it out!<p>

You'll all be happy to know that I plan on open-sourcing the code when I get a little further along, and no, I'm not going to GPL it! :)<p>
