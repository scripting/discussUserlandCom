(Rykodisc #20078)<p>

The liner notes don't come out and say that it's Lennon singing, but it really sounds that way to my ear.  It's a collection of BBC vault recordings that was released in 1988. <p>

The entire album kicks ass, especially: Killing Floor (by Howlin Wolf), Hound Dog (Yes, the Elvis song. Mitch Mitchel providing ... alternate noises), and Catfish Blues (by Muddy Waters).  And there's a bunch of stuff that Hendrix wrote himself on there too. <p>
