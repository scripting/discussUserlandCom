It seems to me that if the Corporation in this case Lotus/ IBM had a way to see how many had downloaded the S/W or had access to a small survey of some kind they would be more inclined to do this in the future.  This would further put some competitive pressure on other candidates to do likewise.   A polite email is always good but maybe there is a better way.
