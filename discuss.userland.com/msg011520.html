does someone know this behaviour? Whenever I want to check in an object on a NT server machine using webedit, I get the following error: <p>

The server returned error code 4: Can't call the script because the name "isCheckedOutByUser" hasn't been defined.<p>

Now, I know there were problems with different versions of WebEdit, but since I installed versions >2 on either machine, I wonder what's going wrong...<p>

Thanks for any input.
