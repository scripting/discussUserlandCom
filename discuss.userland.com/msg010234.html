But there's another constituency the website has to serve, people who do care about the features-and-benefits. It's the boss! <p>

We get a lot of feedback from technical people who want to use Frontier, but when their boss reads the site to decide if they should commit to the product (the geek might quit) he wants to get an idea that the company can explain the product quickly to a person who is not a developer (he or she might quit too). <p>

Remember no one ever got fired for not buying Frontier! (At least not yet.)<p>

And thanks for recognizing that it takes time to do this stuff! (Sometimes people forget.)
