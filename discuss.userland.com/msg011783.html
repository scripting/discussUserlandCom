That sounds like sendmail to me Dave.  Sendmail is available both on Unix/Linux and on NT.<p>

Sendmail Inc. is a commercial entity that could probably give you at least some direction on how to go about working with the sendmail code.<p>

As for platforms, the open-source requirement points to the various flavors of Unix, especially FreeBSD or Linux.  I don't know of a Mac or Windows mail server that is open source.<p>

I'm running sendmail on Linux, so I'm not exactly impartial...<p>
