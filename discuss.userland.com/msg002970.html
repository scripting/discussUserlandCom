What I am having trouble wrapping my mind around is how I could use e-mail as in input to a discussion group.<p>

Here's my scenario:  A homework hotline system for my school district.  I already have one set up that allows a teacher to send a message that gets turned into a web page, with each new message replacing the one before that.  Thay way, parents only have to know one URL and they can always find the most recent posting.<p>

I am really excited about the prospects of taking advantage of the new DG features, but I want to allow those teachers who so desire to stick with an e-mail based system, so the ability to hook Eric's mailserver into the discussion group framework would be great.  Is this doable?
