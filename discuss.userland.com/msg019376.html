As an ISP, I can comment on this & shed some light on our collective POV. (if I can be so bold to speak for the industry)<p>

Over the years we have had a number of inquiries from people who want a dialup "static IP" for $19.95 per month. We always refuse, although there are ISPs who will do this. The reason is that we know the customer will be running a server, and will make pains to keep the connection up 24/7. This is a line that costs <B>us</B> about $40 per month, paid to Ma Bell. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out this is a losing proposition for us.<p>

We've been spending all morning cleaning up the mess created by a dialup customer who thinks he knows how to run a mailserver over a dialup connection. We've got 1,100 messages, each about 250K in size in our mail queue. Each one, when processed, bounces back and gets a little bigger each time. (an error message is appended) As you can imagine this has brought our email server to its knees.<p>

A delightful problem to have, especially compounded because all our <B>other</B> customers are calling in, complaining about crappy service, want an adjustment to their invoice, etc. etc.<p>

At the moment I'm not inclined to alter my service agreement! If you <B>still</B> think I should, I've got a business to sell you!!! ;-)
