Unlike transgenic modifications that produce proteins(like insulin) in milk of animals, male animals don't need to be "freshened"(have offspring to keep milk flowing), and they can produce semen all year round.  A little "collection baggie" will make it easier(and much cleaner) to collect.<p>

Here is an article about it in BBC news. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_485000/485123.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_485000/485123.stm</a><p>

My own personal fear is that they will genetically engineer pigs with balls the size of grapefruits and 2 foot long schlongs to "facilitate collection".  :-)  I don't want to feel inferior to a pig.
