Now you can subscribe to email-delivered "bulletins" from the Scripting News home page. It's an editorial controlled thing, you won't get all the items from the home page, but it's a way to wire up to SN thru email, and it's a testbed for a similar feature we're going to provide (probably) in Manila.<p>

<a href="http://prefs.userland.com/default$3">To subscribe</a>, just go to the prefs page for bulletins. Right now there's an option to have HTML or not HTML, but we pretty much always send HTML. The non-HTML version is not recommended at this time.<p>

Enjoy and Dig We Must!<p>

Dave<p>

PS: You may get a few test messages if you subscribe in the next few hours.
