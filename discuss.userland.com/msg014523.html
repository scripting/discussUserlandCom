I just upgraded.  Now my Frontier and my IIS are running at the same time.  And both are happy.  Perfect!  I was starting to wonder if you were trying to usurp IIS itself.  This will go a long way for me to sell this to my managers at philly.com.  They were observing my frustrations with Frontier last week and becoming a bit concerned that I was wasting their time.<p>

I can't wait until this feature is 'out of beta'.<p>

Thank you!
