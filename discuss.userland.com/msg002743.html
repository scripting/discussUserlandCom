The idea is: there's one big page, with a very plain template, that you can print out by loading in your web browser and choosing the Print command.<p>

Or you can read it on your laptop on the train, no net connection required.<p>

It's a big page, so it's slow to load on the web -- the idea is it would be on your hard drive, part of the Frontier distribution, so load time is not an issue. (Once it's loaded, navigation is super-fast, as it's all done with anchors.)<p>

The guide is geared toward website building, the core feature of Frontier. Website competency is a necessary foundation for almost everything else in Frontier, including using mainResponder, so building websites is what this is about.<p>

It contains (will contain) a website tutorial, a section on writing with Frontier's outliner, a scripting tutorial (geared toward writing macros, outline renderers, other website scripts), and an Appendix which contains reference material, such as descriptions of Frontier's menus.<p>

Not all of the material is in there yet -- I'm busy updating and getting in there existing material. There is a little new content to write.<p>

I'm not interested in having typos and similar pointed out. I know that much of the material is not in there yet. Some of the language needs editing. Since this is pre-rough-draft, you can assume I know about all that.<p>

What I'd like is for some one or several people to print out the page and let me know how it prints. If I need to make changes in this regard, I'd rather make them early rather than later.<p>

Here's the current version:<p>

I'll be updating the page periodically today and tonight as it progresses.
