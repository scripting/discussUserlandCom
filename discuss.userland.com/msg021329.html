ThemeStream, Soapbox, ePinions - I'm sure there are more. Pretty much one-way, though, for me at least - not many readers seem to leave comments or even rate articles.  The lack of feedback is distressing.  Anyone else post writings on one of these (or similar) and get a different response? Pondering- <i>How does one become a "known" author anyway</i>.
