I think you are misinterpreting what free software is about and, as a
result, mis-applying its ethics to Linux Journal.  The biggest free
software advocate that has walked the planet, RMS, has said that
documentation that is *essential* to using the software should be
freely modifiable and freely redistributable.  The important thing is
the "modifiable" clause, though.  It seems that much of the discussion
here has focused on the distribution of LJ rather than the
modifiability of it, which misses the whole point.  It is important
that essential documentation for free software remain freely
modifiable.  Why?  Because if I make a change to the software (which
is what free software is about, after all), then I might need to
change the documentation to match.<p>

Anyway, how does all this apply to Linux Journal?  I see Linux Journal
as an aggregator of content.  They gather it up and publish it in a
single volume.  They aren't obligated to make the binary or source of
their aggregated volume free in the same way that RedHat doesn't make
the ISO image of the CD or the scripts to create the image availible.
You can get all the components of a RedHat CD for free, you can even
download the directory structure for free, but you have to do a little
work to get it onto the CD.  Compare this to the Mandrake or Debian
releases which have freely-available ISO images and
freely-modifiable/redistributable tools for creating slightly modified
versions of those same images.<p>

Back to Linux Journal.  They aggregate content.  You could go to each
author and get their article from them if that author decided to let
you have it.  You could then publish a copy of Linux Journal (minus
the ads, or with your own ads) yourself.  To me, this seems very similar to the situation with
different Linux distributions -- especially different RedHat-derived
distributions.  It is just that since the authors have clearly
licensed and "published" their software it is much easier to make a
RedHat-derived distribution than it would be to make a Linux
Journal-derived publication.<p>

(In fact, it seems to me that if you wanted to "force" Linux Journal
to put their stuff on the web, you could publish your own version of
the magazine on the web.  If, in fact, Linux Journal does not restrict the author's right to republish, they would have no legal recourse. IANAL, though.)<p>

So what about the "freeness" (speech) of Linux Journal?  Their
magazine is not essential to the use of the software.  What is written
in their magazine may be helpful, it may enlighten, but it isn't
important that you be able to modify it if the software that an
article describes changes.  It isn't even important that the articles be freely availible for use.  So, I don't think they are being
hypocritical.<p>

And I'm a free software zealot<p>

(Disclaimer: I've only perused one copy of LJ, so I may not be the
best judge of the essentialness of the publication.)
