From the quick glance that I did as well as listening to Jason Hunter (<a href="http://www.servlets.com">http://www.servlets.com</a>), Tea is JSP done right, ie if it could be blown away and left with Tea, there wouldn't be so many problems with the current JSP implementation.<p>

I'm hoping to investigate Tea a bit more in the near future...<p>
