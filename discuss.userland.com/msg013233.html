Interestingly we're on the verge of being able to do this in Manila, replacing a couple hundred lines of Perl with one line of Frontier code and a bit of "wrapper" HTML.<p>

Here's a simple example. <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/bierman/">Bob Bierman</a> has Scripting News and Wired on his home page. (We just got this stuff working last night.)<p>

<a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/"><img src="../cluetrain/clues/currentClue.gif" align="right" border="0" hspace="12"></a>Doc is working on logos for <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain.Com</a> this morning. He just did eight. If you refresh this page eight times in eight minutes you should see them all. It's a slightly more subtle technique than an animated GIF, more subliminal too, I think.<p>

Yesterday's <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/results/dave@userland.com/whatToDoAboutApple">survey about Apple</a> was a hit at MacWEEK. Jeff Cheney writes: "The one about Jakob Nielsen made me laugh the hardest." ";->"<p>

Python.Org: <a href="http://www.python.org/topics/xml/xbel/">The XML Bookmark Exchange Language (XBEL)</a>.<p>

<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.11/digiscent.html">Wired</a>: "Once more I breathe deeply - 'Orange peel,' I report. My hosts relax in their chairs, looking immensely relieved."<p>

<a href="http://tv.cream.org/boredrate/wuname/wuform.html">The Wu-Tang Namelizer</a> is back on the air, but they changed the algorithm. Now I'm "Half-Cut Skeleton". <i>I prefer Likeable Warlock.</i><p>

<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/margaretHKUlog/"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/margaret.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" border="0"></a>On Thursday we started 30+ new weblogs for Dan Gillmor's students at Hong Kong University. This morning I received a pointer to <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/margaretHKUlog/">Seabird's Nest</a>, which is one of those sites. I guess the experiment is working! (Dan's new Wu-Tan name is "Obsequious Hen". Arrrrgh!)<p>

Marc Canter and Bill Gates still map to the same Wu-Tan name. "Embryonic Informer." Oy. They should go back to the old system. It was mystical and fun! This one is just stupid.<p>

<a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/1999/1120/news-im.html?id=userland">Red Herring</a>: "Citing a security problem exposed in AOL's instant messaging software, [Microsoft] says it's calling off efforts to make its MSN Messenger client interoperable with AOL Instant Messenger." <i>Red Herring is "Crafty Wife-Beatah".</i><p>

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/12/24/xmasPiece">12/24/97</a>: "There were the sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties. What will we call the decade between 2000 and 2009?"<p>
