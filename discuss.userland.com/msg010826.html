The interface isn't pretty, and that may actually handle more information then you will collect (or not...), but the basic interface is there.  A few things you don't need... although, marking feature requests with result codes might be cool... collecting the list of "Added in later version" features would be cool. (And a wonderful selling point for the company :-) )<p>

<I>(Fun typo note: The first sentance of this post originally read as "Feature requesting strikes me as awfully similar to bug requesting."  Although, IIRC, Mozilla had a bug request page when they were trying to match, bug for bug, the behavior of previous browsers, so maybe bug requesting isn't so far-fetched...)</I>
