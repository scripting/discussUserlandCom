Yes. But you have to have reverse IP working on your DNS server.
I believe they look up the physical (street, city, country, etc.) address stored in the whois database.<p>

But it's expensive, so I don't understand why they're doing it. I can see MS or Netscape having to do it to ensure that you're not sitting in Iraq and trying to download the 128-bit version of IE.
