I can't help wondering whether you
are exagerrating your frustration with Clinton's lies for
rhetorical effect, though... like Claude Rains in
"Casablanca," it seems to me that you are shocked, shocked,
to find that Clinton has been lying to us so ruthlessly and
for so long.<p>

Alan Coren once observed (I'm paraphrasing) that democracy
is that form of government in which we choose our dictators
after listening to them tell us what we want to hear.<p>

That's basically what we've done with Clinton, and it's a
little late to complain about it now.<p>

As someone who has been a professional politician for most
of his adult life, Clinton is a liar by definition and of
necessity; it is next to impossible to build a constituency
in this country via a rational discussion of actual issues.<p>

The last President who tried this tactic, and who also tried
to be basically honest with the American people in matters
political and personal, was Jimmy Carter--probably because
he followed Nixon's disgusting performance and Ford's brief,
bumbling coda.<p>

Carter was easily the least effective President in modern
American history.  Reagan certainly noticed this.  So did
Bush.  And so did Clinton.<p>

Here's what they noticed: honesty gets you retired.  Quickly.<p>

In an era of electronic media, it pays to talk in soundbites
and say nothing of substance unless it's already been tested
in a couple of focus groups.  Like it or not (and I don't
particularly like it), this is the strategy that pays off,
over and over again.  People with real ambitions would be 
fools to try anything else.<p>

You make some interesting points about sexual harrassment
law, but so far, not a single instance of sexual harrassment
has provably occurred.  The ugly truth is that we're about
to attempt to remove a President from office because he lied
about a series of sexual escapades between consenting
adults, and *not* because he has committed "high crimes" or
conducted treasonous activities.  Another ugly truth: this
is an issue that is tailor-made to play to religious
conservatives, and the GOP has made a devil's bargain with
this constituency; from time to time, it must be served.<p>

American politics as practiced at the turn of the 20th
century is a rigged game being sold to a credulous audience.
Happily, government is less relevant to the lives of most
Americans than ever before in our country's history.
