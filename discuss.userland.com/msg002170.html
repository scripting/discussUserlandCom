I did a search for string.parseHttpArgs, unfortunately there's no <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/">DocServer</a> page for it, but I did find a sample call on <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/migrating/toysList.html">this page</a>. Here's the call:<p>

<pre>dialog.alert (string.parseHTTPargs ("name=Mason+Hale&address=1801+Winsted"))</pre><p>

I did some testing on my laptop, and sure enough string.parseHTTPargs is also doing a string.urlDecode. So your theory was correct, we were double-processing the POST args, and that's how we were losing the plusses. <p>


<b>Fixed!</b><p>

But it works now. Here's a bunch of plusses to prove the point:<p>

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + <p>

I could program in C++ if I wanted to!<p>

12 + 12 = 24<p>

+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + <p>

I think that about nails this one. The change was in mainResponder.respond, it's available to NS testers in the usual place. A virtual golden keychain from UserLand to Roepcke. As always, a pleasure doing business with you!<p>

PS: I just did the DocServer page for <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/string/parsehttpargs">string.parseHttpArgs</a>.<p>
