If developers use XML to be compatible, then it's loveable. If they use it to beat each other over the head with marketing hype, well then it's not loveable.<p>

I like working for the Fawcette people. My editor is Dan Gillmor's brother Steve. He's a very supportive guy. That's how editors should be. He sends me one line reviews of my pieces, and says when I'm in flow, or not. <p>

They also get me a lot of web flow, which is good for the business. ";->"
