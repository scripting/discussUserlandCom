Since Kernel-E is very close, semantically, to <a href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/">Scheme</a> but is written in Java, I suggested that they use the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/">Kawa</a> project's <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/kawa/api/gnu/bytecode/package-summary.html">gnu.bytecode</a> and <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/kawa/api/gnu/expr/package-summary.html">gnu.expr</a> packages to ease the compiler's development.<p>

Sure enough, E is under the MPL and gnu.bytecode and gnu.expr were under the GPL, so they weren't "link-compatible," to use Mark Miller's phrase. It seemed kind of goofy to me, although I was well aware of the problematic aspects of the GPL&mdash;E, AFAIK, always expects to ship source anyway.<p>

Regardless, the E team wouldn't move (and rightly so, I think), so I thought, well, I doubt Per Bothner wanted his libraries <i>not</i> to be used, so I e-mailed him about the issue, and he was kind enough to change gnu.bytecode and gnu.expr's licenses to a modified GPL that rather strongly resembles the LGPL and is MPL-compatible. All the lawyers were happy, Per is happy, Mark Miller is happy, so I'm happy.<p>

But why was such a conversation necessary in the first place?
