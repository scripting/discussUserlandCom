Yes you can have a command that sends any information about the current project back to the server. You could do things like:<p>

1) send the current page<p>

2) do dom manipulations on the local page, like getElementsByTagName() etc.<p>

3) insert via an object a dynamic element which may via xml-rpc create say a calender, which then get's inserted into the current document<p>

4) completel re-write the current document via any information received by an xml-rpc command<p>

5)get information about the current directory structure.<p>

6) Use frontier to generate graphs via dreamweaver's integration with fireworks.<p>

I want to make sure this works though. Can you give me a URL to point to and a test xml-rpc message to send?
