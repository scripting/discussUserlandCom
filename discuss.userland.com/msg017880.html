I built a really nice library of oldies but goodies. A month ago I tried finding some of my kind of my music, but there was nothing. This evening I found *everything* I looked for. It's all out there. <p>

Listening to Alvin Lee right now, the Woodstock performance of I'm Going Home. Haven't heard this in 20 years. Wow. Music is so cool, and it works so well over the Web. Finally.
