A. Has just lost its government and civil war is about to ensue.<p>

B. When the people have the object of the upcomming civil war in their possession.(Ceausescu)<p>

C. The only way to stop the supporters of Ceausescu from causing a civil war is to dispose of him.<p>

D. Making him disappear would only provide for more chaos and confusion for a terrified populace.<p>

E. The military switched sides from Ceausescu to the people only when they saw the writting on the wall.  Thereby creating a dangerous wildcard who might switch sides again if Ceausescu lived.<p>

F. When a 3 year trial would only be a festering sore on the country digging up old wounds, and preventing the country from moving forward.<p>


They had just lost their government.  They had no body of laws under which a fair trial could take place.  They had no cohesive group in charge of the country.  When a country is in a situation like that, realpolitik demands that you have a trial and observe the forms to placate the people, then you swiftly remove the danger and stabilize the country.<p>

That is why I can't fault them.
