The truth is, the best platform for employing rich client interfaces is IE5 on Windows.<p>

It's the most stable, most flexible platform out there, regardless of your opinions of Microsoft or its browser.  It supports XML, has a great plugin/download system, and is fast and customizable.<p>


Broadband Mechanics and simple.com are others who have implemented cool UI front ends to web apps using IE5.<p>

The browser wars are so over.  I'm looking for a stable, fast, extensible, cross-platform, customizable web application client software. This client would:<p>


<ol>
<li> understand common Internet protocols, like http, ftp, and would support new ones via plugins. I imagine that it would ship with a 'browser' plugin so that it could be used as a web browser.
 
<li> have a http server, and understand xml-rpc to enable web applications.<p>

<li> have a set of rich, gorgeous UI widgets that developers can develop <i>_leveraging their existing knowledge of html, flash, & javascript_</i> to develop solid ui's for their web apps.<p>

<li> have great text editing tools.<p>

<li> have a well documented api of file system interaction for storing local information/files.<p>

<li> have a security model.<p>

<li> be available on Mac, Win, and flavors of Unix, especially Linux.<p>

</ol><p>

Killer app is an overused hype word, but I'd certainly kill to get my hands on this app.  <p>

Basically, I'm sick of developing for the browsers.  They suck.  I'm tired of being slave to the browsers.  Give me a consistent cross-platform platform I can build on, and I'm (using that magic marketspeak phrase that the VC's will understand)your customer for life.<p>

"zeldman.astin" This is what I look like when I talk about how bad the browsers are.  I really get worked up, I might look a little crazy.
