Traditionally records label will license an album by territory. Different countrries will actually pay different amounts for the right to put out the same album - people in South America will not pay as much as those in Europe. Labels effectively auction off the rights country by country. But the internet knows no such boundaries and so labels aren't able to capitalise on this. It'd be a huge dent in their profits.<p>

The other issue to bear in mind is who owns the right to the song and who owns the right to the recording. If the label only owns the right to the recording then you just need to find a recording that isn't owned, copyright controlled as they say maybe from a live show. The only issue then is artist royalties. Send Mr Scot_Heron $1 for every download.
