Thanks for a very thoughtful article. I do find issue with one of the
statements, that if "3) strong encryption will be banned outright", then "law enforcement [will] be able to crack open bad people's messages". The illegality of encryption will not stop "bad people" from using it to hide their intentions.<p>

If you accept that fact, you can see we're not really being asked to make a choice. Bad people will have encryption in any case, so what's happening here is that authorities are trying to restrict good people's right to use encryption to enforce their privacy. I really don't know enough about US law to argue whether the right to privacy is protected by the constitution. However I do believe the justification is facetious, and that there are already sufficient laws under obstruction of justice to prosecute bad people using encryption to hide their intentions.<p>

The rest of your article is water-tight.
