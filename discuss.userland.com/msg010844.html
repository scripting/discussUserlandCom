What happens when someone doesn't like the way he has classified a channel? What does he do if two people feel the channel should be classified in different places?"<p>

I think you've missed a major point here. The most important advantage of the DDC is that it does *not* depend on James to make it work. The DDC is supported by an international body of experts, and has extremely well-documented processes and procedures for performing the cataloguing, complete with state-of-the-art online support, which is why several studies have demonstrated that there is a very high correlation among classifications performed by independent cataloguers.<p>

Contrast this with the ad-hoc schemes. If you disagree with the way an Open Directory editor has classified a site, you have nothing to fall back on - it becomes a shouting match. With the DDC, you always have an authoritative answer with a well-reasoned rationale to refer to.
