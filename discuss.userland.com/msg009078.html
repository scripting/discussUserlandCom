I don't think I can articulate well enough why I think that there's a place for both open and closed source architectures in a competitive software industry. I guess what I'm saying is that if you don't want to use Frontier because its kernel is closed-source then that's cool. I just get tired of hearing that every piece of software under the sun should be open source or else it's worthless.<p>
