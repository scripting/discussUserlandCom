No such packages exist, because the Open Source Definition explicitly prohibits licensing fees.<p>

What "(flFreeLikeSpeech and not flFreeLikeBeer)" really means is that no one is <b>obligated</b> to give out $0.00 copies of the software. A good example is the TiVO set-top-box; it runs Linux, but if you want the source code you have to send them $25. Of course, one person will probably buy the CD and then put the contents up on an FTP site, but TiVO is not obligated to do that.<p>

This is all AFAIK, so feel free to correct me.
