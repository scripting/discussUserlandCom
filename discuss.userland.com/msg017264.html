";->"<br><br>	There will be server maintenence late tonight, watch <a href="http://www.inessential.com/">Brent's weblog</a> for news of this work. <br><br>	See y'all in Amsterdam!<br><br><b>Templates for Newbies</b><br><br>	Marc Canter has been on my case for months to offer Manila users a set of starter templates to choose from. I asked him to help, to choose a set of sites that make him happy. <br><br>	So here are <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$649">Marc's favorite templates</a>. Using this set as inspiration we're going to try to come up with a set of three or five starter sites. <br><br>	Brent is going to do this work over the next couple of weeks, while I'm traveling in Europe. It's been quite difficult to get this project started, but once we have a popup menu on our "I Want One" page, I think the best designers are going to want their creations in that menu. <br><br>	It's a chicken and egg thing, I believe. We'll give it another try, maybe this is the time it becomes soup.<br><br><b>"Open" vs "Closed" software</b><br><br>	The Great Debate continues. <br><br>	Phillip Birmingham <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$17261">says</a> "'Open' software can be shared without risking its author's wrath; 'closed' software cannot. To ask people not to use labels for this is to ask them not to care."<br><br>	To which I <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$17263">respond</a>: "OK, so if we're going to pick labels so you can be informed, let's try this. The stuff you can download and share is called 'shareware' and the stuff you have to pay for is called 'commercial software.'"<br><br>	This gets rid of the perjoratives, helps us be friends. And also gives advice to people who think there's a free lunch in "open source." When Frontier was free, the number one bit of pain people gave me was "I guess you get what you pay for."<br><br><b>Other news</b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.inessential.com/sheila/2000/05/12">Sheila</a> is chased by raccoons.

The Internet played a huge role in this march. Without the Internet, there is no way this could have happened. This was a truly grass-roots campaign and much of the fund raising and communications happened through the web site. Many of the organizers of the March will be meeting each other for the first time ever in person this weekend."<br><br>	Reuters: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/406532.asp">Net changes target for gun advocacy</a>.<br><br>
