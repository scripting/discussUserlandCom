Each of them offers an opportunity for follow-up, a deeper investigation, exposure of new ideas. This world is bristling with them.<br><br>	So far, these points of view have not been reflected in the general press.<br><br>	A distant memory. There was a time when the press reported on the lack of Mac developers as a major liability for Apple, but never talked about Mac developers. In other words they were reporting on their filters, nothing deeper.<br><br>	A similar thing is going on now. Like VCs, the press mostly writes what their competitors write. Fortune reporters read Business Week; ZDNet reads News.Com. This can make it non-fluid, it's hard for different ideas to circulate or mingle. What if Dot-Net is <i>both</i> a Microsoft and open source story? (It is.) <br><br>	Is there room for curveballs like SOAP, which is also supported by Sun? How do you explain that? I haven't seen any stories on this, other than the initial one at News.Com, which was pretty superficial.<br><br>	Dot-Net is a curveball. It doesn't fit it into one of the standard templates, that's why the press is having so much trouble with it. (BTW, Microsoft has a terrible track record for creating sticky visions in the minds of the press. It's a meta-story for sure, but more to the point than most of the coverage.)<br><br>	<i>Dot-Net is even broader than it might seem. P2P, which is the rage in VC-land is the same thing. As are Napster and Gnutella. They all use incompatible payload formats, but the concepts of distributed computing, fractional horsepower HTTP servers, and leveraging the desktop are same elements that make up Dot-Net.</i><br><br>	Also, don't miss the importance of Web Apps. Dual interfaces, both browser-based and tool-based are essential. I want to update my site whether I am using a public terminal or writing at my desktop. This goes back to Gates's statement at Davos that the desktop is still central. So true. But so is the browser.<br><br><b>Speaking of filters<a name="speakingOfFilters">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/16#speakingOfFilters" title="Permanent link to 'Speaking of filters' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I have them too.<br><br>	Why don't I devote more energy to MattG's music <a href="http://themes.editthispage.com/">site</a>?<br><br>	It's always the top item on this <a href="http://www.userland.com/mostReadSitesYesterday">list</a>.<br><br><b>Today's songs<a name="todaysSongs">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/16#todaysSongs" title="Permanent link to 'Today's songs' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.summer.com.br/~pfilho/html/lyrics/i/if_you_love_somebody_set_them_free.txt">Sting</a>: "If you want to hold onto your possession, don't even think about me.
