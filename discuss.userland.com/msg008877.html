Dvorak was just being...well Dvorak. He's paid to be contrary and a little outrageous.<p>

Another valid point he made was that the Mac proponents just lap it all up. Whatever Jobs lays out is swalloed whole, without a critical look.<p>

The iBook is not perfect, and it's not only the colors. We're half way through 1999 and here comes Jobs with a notebook that has a 12" LCD display and a measly 3.4GB drive. What now, "home" users don't want to download photos from their digital cameras or play those new Mac games? What's the point in a fast PC with no room to play.<p>

Yes, he was not being PC or sensitive, but Dvorak hit a nerve.
