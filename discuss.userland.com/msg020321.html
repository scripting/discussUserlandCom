In that code, it was commonly expected that people would use the code, or even incorporate "an entire subsystem" in another body of code, with some kind of expectation that the new code would also be posted (though not a hard expectation).<p>

It wasn't really until [6, "extend it slightly [or not], and sell binary kits for $149"] started happening more and more often that people started being concerned about what happened to the code they posted, and they started adding licenses.  Those who didn't see a problem with [5] or [6] used a TrulyFree license, those who did see a problem used LGPL or GPL.
