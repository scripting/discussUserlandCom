The immediate value to the user of this is limited by the fact that an XML document can have any form it's creator wants.  It's like saying "this is a site to search any database anywhere".  My intepretation of <TITLE> might be totally different to yours.<p>

However, there's definitely scope where the same DTDs are being used, as it basically becomes a database query tool.  The RSS and scriptingNews formats are good examples where it would work, though the low complexity of the documents hardly makes the context searching worth it.<p>

Jakob Nielsen's article on Content Integration (<a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990627.html">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990627.html</a>) makes the point that for successful content integration, separate sources need to agree on standard for meta-data.  There is a strong echo of this in searching web XML documents.<p>

Web search engines work because we all use a limited and relatively defined number of character sets.  For web-wide XML search engines to work, we'll need to use a limited and relatively defined number of DTDs, or provide a better way to self-describe.<p>

I'm not sure searching the global totality of XML documents is something that would prove very useful anyway (any more than current search engines, that is): far more useful would be to navigate through various interest areas and then perform this kind of context search on a subset (which increases the chances of being able to do something intelligent with the query anyway).   A sort of merging of ideas between XMLtree.com and GoXML.com perhaps??<p>

Anyway, from a developer's point of view, GoXML.com sounds like a great deal of fun.  When you get a huge bunch of data together, interesting things always happen, as evidenced by My.UserLand.Com.
