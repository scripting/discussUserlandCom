It seems to be an obvios thing to do. Although I personally have the feeling, that diving into RTF will be a lot of overhead when Office 2000 can export XML.<p>

If one starts an importer suite for word files, he/she would have to do it in a way, so that all the old formats will be imported as well (wether they are pre-processed as RTF or not).<p>

I am going to take a look at the RTF format...<p>
