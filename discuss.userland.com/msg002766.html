You could use JavaScript to dynamically create an "Edit this page" button based on the presence of a cookie on the browser viewing the page. Why bother? I dunno.

It's a waste of time. Since, in order to have the functionality, you must have a Frontier running somewhere, just use it to work on the site. No amount of convolution is going to get around the reality, if it's a static page, it can't respond to you in a dynamic way. You've just pushed that reality back one level, it's still there.<p>
