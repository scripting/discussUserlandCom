His story sounds a lot like mine:  <p>

<i>I switched from Macintosh to Wintel, survived and prospered. In fact, when I crossed over, it was like being liberated. <p>

I no longer felt compelled to defend a product that cost me more. I was no longer a prisoner of a rapacious company that led me down bizarre technological alleys and then abandoned me. I no longer had to excuse the actions of a company that crushed all its competition and got away with it. <p>

Oh, by the way, it also turns out that Windows is a better OS than Macintosh. Maybe that wasn't always true, but right now, at the end of the 20th century, Windows is better than the Mac OS. It's easier to learn, easier to use, more stable, and simpler for all the Average Joes out there whose only goal is to hook up a printer and a monitor and surf the Internet. </i><p>

There was a time when the Mac really broke new ground.  Those of us who fought for it, to make this obviously-superior platform better-accepted, did Apple -- and the world -- a service.  That's over.  Now Apple sells packaging, plain and simple.<p>
