There's nothing keeping someone from building a word processor, or a spreadsheet app or even an outliner out of these widgets.  The thing you create using xul/js etc. doesnt have to be a browser.  There are folks working on an IRC client, folks building an interface to Zope, etc. etc.<p>

And the cool thing is, you dont _have_ to use xul.  If you just want to make a webpage with cool stuff - go right ahead.  If you want to build an app-like thing - then XUL is there if you want to try it out.<p>


There are also other goodies in this bag:<p>

1) every module (like the http module or the xml interpreter) either already is or will be _scriptable_. Meaning it's interface will be accessable  via javascript (and future langs).<p>

2) another language called XBL (extensible bindings language) allows you to create  your own widgets to use in XUL.  for instance say you had an app which always had 2 dropdown menus plus an input field.  You could create a widget of your own and call it "joe"  whenever XUL saw your "joe" tag, it would put the two dropdowns and the input field.<p>

XBL is how we create scrollbars, buttons, xul form controls, and more stuff. All configurable, editable, etc.<p>

So if you wanted Mac-looking scrollbars, you could just swap out some gifs (pngs) and you have it!<p>

Internally we have a really cool AQUA skin in works.  It even has transparency!<p>


3) There are many tags and stuff in XUL which could combine to make really cool apps. Just because we put together a browser, doesnt mean anyone else could build their own app.  Poking around <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">http://www.mozilla.org</a> and <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org">http://lxr.mozilla.org</a> can give you lots of insight.
