This exercise in counting syllables helped us make naming recommendations for the service. People have a strong tendency to nickname expressions with more than a few syllables; even though "Microsoft Word" is only two words, people still shorten it to "Word." People would certainly coin some short form of a long name like "The Microsoft Interactive Network." We suggested that Microsoft take the reins and do the coining itself -- which it did, settling on "MSN."
