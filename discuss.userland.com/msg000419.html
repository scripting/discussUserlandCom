It's a security feature/flaw that you can only read cookies from the domain they're sent from. The best you can do is just use the domain name itself without any subdomains, so all your Web servers can read the cookie, otherwise, as you've discovered, you don't get anything back.<p>

Also, if you want to convert users with old cookies to new ones without them having to log in again, you'll obviously have to do it from a page on nirvana.userland.com before they can use discuss.userland.com.
