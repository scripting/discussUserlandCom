I have been thinking for some time about building communities using Manila. As a weblog -- fantastic product. <p>

But to build a community? The software is focussed on editors and writers, not visitors.<p>

1. Visitors need to register before posting comments. If you have a large volume web site like Userland.com, no problem -- people will still register. But if you are like most websites at <a href="http://www.editthispage.com">http://www.editthispage.com</a> it's just another stumbling block to getting sticky visitors.<p>

2. Visitors cannot see comments immediately -- most do not even know what the cowskull symbol is. ZDNet and Linux Today have the right idea -- comments below the story -- not in Discuss.<p>

Hope this generates some comments :-)<p>

Regards, John
