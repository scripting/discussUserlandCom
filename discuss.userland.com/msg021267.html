Many newsreaders cache messages.  It's good practice to avoid excessive load on the news server.  Most just cache within a session - which isn't really all that different from what a Web browser does - but some are full offline readers, like my favorite, <a href="http://home.snafu.de/stk/macsoup/">MacSOUP</a>.  Of course, NNTP permits articles to supersede older ones, but this isn't used very often (and isn't honored by some servers).<p>

That said, the DG interface is very inefficient for reading large numbers of messages.  It makes me wait variable amounts of time for messages to be returned.  I would really appreciate an offline reader.  Here's one possibility - an offline reader with the caveat that when you post a reply to the message, it first fetches the most recent version of a message.<p>
