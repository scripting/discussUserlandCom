Thanks, Dave, but I don't have independent knowledge of this, I was just quoting from what I thought I heard Avie Tevanian say and interpreting it according to what I think I know about this thing. I'm waiting to get ahold of a G3 server to actually play with it hands-on. According to my notes [typing in the dark as they were talking on my trusty old PowerBook Duo 2300c], this is what was said:<p>

Cnet guy: does it run any mac software?
Avie: it's not designed to run client software.
Q: blue box?
Avie: Wait for Mac OS X client
avie: the blue box is in the product [i.e. OS X Server] - but you shouldn't run desktop apps on a server because it sucks resources away from server services.<p>

What they're really up to is marketing: positioning, making it clear that this is a server,not a Mac OS replacement, reducing expectations. It would be a lot harder for them to document and support and QA running all Mac apps... the technical piece of implementing it is just a small piece of the puzzle.<p>

Raines (who's never claimed to be a journalist, either, but I play one on TV. ;-))<p>
