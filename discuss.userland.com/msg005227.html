The end result would be that I have the Scripting News, Nahenahe, and whatever other channels I choose appear on my page as tables.<p>

I guess what I'm looking for is a script that will hourly (half-hourly, whatever) call your RSS generator, my Nahenahe RSS generator, and whoever else's, get the data and store it in my news site someplace. On one of my dyamic pages, I call a script that gets this data and renders in within a table, and displays it on the page just like it does in your "view channel" page. <p>

I hope this is clear, and that I'm not missing something basic. I'm sure you'd come up a cleaner way of doing this than I would.
