My bet is that he hasn't seen any impact on sales.<p>

It could have been a tactical mistake for him to put up the open letter, the story was pretty dead as far as I could tell, but he revived it.<p>

The AP and News.Com articles, and esp their headlines, are not favorable to his position.<p>

Another possibility is that he has a heart, and it was opened a bit, he saw that he was doing something bad for the net, and wants to fix it.
