The root of my problem (which is probably just unfamiliarity with inner Frontier) is that I'd like an easy way to programmatically visit all top-level "summits" in a table, and the names of the table elements are not a simple sequence of numbers that would obey a for loop. So if table "whackynames" has an element "grognard" with value "frob", I'd like to refer to this first element by saying whackynames[1] or some other equally easy reference. Yes, I know about table.visit. I may have to fall back to that.
