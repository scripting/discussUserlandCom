to add explicit type information to the server and
client ends; you can simply rely on Python's strong
dynamic typing system to do the right thing.  No
need to add custom proxies or type conversion layers;
<i>the standard interface just works right out of
the box!</i><p>

But if you drop the type info from the wire protocol,
you suddenly have to add type maps to the server and
client ends to get things working.  That's also true
for the various Corba implementations available to
Python folks, like ILU and Fnorb, and these protocols
give you other advantages over XML-RPC.<p>

So if you're doing something that initially seems to
be Python-to-Python only, it's about as easy to use
Corba instead.  And my spontaneous reaction is that
would be a bad thing...
