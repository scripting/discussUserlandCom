The home page of My.UserLand was calling an old script that found a channel table, and if it failed to find the channel, it wouldn't display the story. But it was looking in a table that is no longer being maintained. So it rejected stories from Zac's channel because it had been registered after the switchover to the new software.<p>

There probably are other cases where we're relying on old code, but I'm now out of time for the day. The net-net is that new stories from Zac's channel should now display on the My.UserLand home page when they appear.
