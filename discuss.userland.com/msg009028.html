Hi Dave. As you know, many folks at Microsoft and Waggener Edstrom read DaveNet religiously. Being new to the MS CCG business (moving over from Office), I couldn't help but respond to your most recent edition on instant messaging. <p>

Isn't the real issue truly about creating a standard so that the servers
are independent and messages can flow freely between clients vs. writing
proprietary protocols to one server or another? The goal for instant
messaging and the root of what MS and other companies working toward the
IETF standard is aiming achieve is create a user experience that is
similar to that of the open and seamless nature of the telephone and/or
email (an example that you even reference in your piece as working well
today). The debate extends far beyond the issue du jour between MS and
AOL.<p>

And, why such a strong focus on the server vs. the client anyway?
Consumers don't care about the plumbing or the process of directing email
from one contact to another -- they just want it to work. To your issue of
server maintenance cost, while vendors providing the communications
service may incur some degree of this, it is a mutually shared
responsibilty on both the sending and receiving ends and should simply be
considered a part of providing the best experience possible for customers
-- it's a part of the service, just like any other product feature. And,
from a consumer standpoint, it's certainly similar to how email works
today in that people can freely send and receive email without expecting
to incur any additional costs on either end.<p>

Looking forward to future reports and any additional feedback you may have on this topic. Thanks for your time.
