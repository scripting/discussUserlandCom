Perhaps only a small percentage of listeners to freely-distributed MP3 files would tip. But perhaps that percentage would be enough to enable the musicians to earn their living.</I><p>

Esp. if tipping became a culturally mandated thing, like tipping food servers (at least here in the USA).  Many servers make more on tips then salary, perhaps even most; I don't know as my only experience is with my friends who have been employed that way.  I think it would go that way for music, too, as long as it was as easy tipping is in real life.<p>

It would be interesting to see what the culturally accepted "tip" would be for songs, and what criteria would be used to decide (as "price of meal" is a deciding factor in the order-of-magnitude of the tip to a server)...
