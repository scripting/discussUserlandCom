Truly original ideas are impossible to communicate, because there's nothing for others to latch onto; so you have to deal with the transitions, the leaps of understanding. Metaphors are good, because they're transitional by nature -- they yoke the unfamiliar to the familiar, they <i>hack language</i> -- but the choice of metaphors is often the key to communicating well.<p>

And to be honest, it's not a vision unless you communicate it. That's what separates the prophet Isaiah from the inhabitants of the local asylum: the ability to turn a vision into something people will listen to. <p>
