I remember a long time ago there being a scanner that had AppleTalk on it so you could do workgroup scanning.  I assume they didn't sell very many of them, because there would be scanners out there with networking if there was a market.<p>

It is totally impractical to have a networked scanner.  Having a networked scanner is about as practical as having a networked toilet.  In both cases you have to walk to the networked device to drop off your load.  :-)  Also if you share, how can someone else know if you are done with the crap or not.  <p>

If you want the scanner at your desk, then it makes no sense for a scanner to have a hard disk, memory, processor, network connection, when your computer has perfectly servicable substitutes available.  Scanning is easy, which is why scanners cost less than $200.  Storing, adjusting, reduction, color correction, dithering, expansion, processing, transmission, and conversion are hard, which is why a computer costs $2,000.
