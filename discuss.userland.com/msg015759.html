I think it's time for the Scripting News community to give a Big Group Hug to Luke and the Qube Qrowd. I think it sucks that Cobalt points to Slashdot from their site and ignores Qube Quorner. When are those guys going to take a ride on the Cluetrain? <br><br>Dan Gillmor wrote a glowing <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg032600.htm">piece</a> about Cobalt. He interviewed me for it, I said they're smart, for sure, but they're blowing it with the Qube. A brilliant product, ahead of the time, but they're letting the market catch up with them. Perhaps they can make more money on RAQs, but we will remember them for the Qube. A company with a huge hoard of cash can afford to build a market! Hello. $1000 is a nice pricepoint. The Qube Quounts. Every Mac LAN should have a Qube. <i>Hello Qubetrain!</i><br><br>Conclusion: All the Linux guys are rushing to grow to compete with Dell. I think Dell will win that one. Zig don't zag.<br><br>Now a message to Dan Gillmor, who I just heard interviewed on NPR. Dan, we help you, please help us. In this world reciprocity counts. It's not compromising to your editorial integrity to include your experience in the web world in your presence in older media, where they like the credibility that comes from being part of a major news pub. Help Luke help Qube users. Why not? When you talk about revolutionary trends in technology mention the web, and the boom in easy to use authoring tools. Anyone can gush with ease when it comes to gigahertz processors. You lament the lack of innovation in software. Hello Dan!<br><br>OTOH, Luke must take some of the responsibility for the lack of support from hardware vendors. He made a big mistake by incorrectly stating my point of view with a rep of VA Linux. Too bad. I'm more interested in getting an easily scriptable version of PHP with the right macros in standard distribution by Cobalt and VA. We should have <i>integration</i> between Manila and the runtimes on the servers, not necessarily with UserLand software. That's why we did xml-rpc. Luke incorrectly guessed our motive and plan, and made the mistake of telling that to the VA guy w/o checking with me. At the time we already had Manila static rendering working! Oy. The VA guy was was concerned that I'm a random huckster with compromised integrity, even though Doc Searls had already told him otherwise. Luke fed right into his fear and he ran away, that was the last we ever heard from him. So Luke, why don't you tell the story publicly and say what you learned? It will make us all more effective at gathering the support we want.<br><br>Now a question for everyone. It's The Year 2000. There's a brand name up for grabs. If you believe in the power of web community, what does that make you? It's a puzzle. Figure it out.<br><br>Hint: Too bad this <a href="http://www.communism.com/">name</a> is taken.<br><br>AP: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/388508.asp">Reform rabbis back same-sex unions</a>. <i>Excellent!</i><br><br><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$15758">Will Cate quotes</a> a report in today's WSJ. "Amid a growing debate over patents that stake out broad claims for basic methods of doing business on the Web, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is expected Wednesday to unveil an overhaul of the way it examines applications and awards patents for many online practices." Happy! We'll watch for this announcement, can't point to the WSJ article, it's behind a for-fee firewall.<br><br>"jerry"<br><br>
