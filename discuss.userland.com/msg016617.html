So why not just treat open source's failure to meet the needs of writers, designers, graphics people as an opportunity. Open source is going to be targeted towards a more technical type of person for the foreseable future. That's how the model works. Thinking about other types of users is expensive, most projects don't have the budget to do the expensively necessary tasks to allow it to reach a wider community.
<p>
If they don't "get it" it could be because they don't need to yet. It's not in their world.  Open Source advocates, while increasingly speaking to a wider audience are still mainly producing tools that are used by, in the a manner appropriate to the author themselves.

Why should Apache try to meet the needs of writers, designers, or graphics people? That's not their target audience, and trying to switch to meet that audience would be a significant change in direction? And if the need for the web server to reach writers, designers, and graphics people is a pressing need who's time has come then it's a great opportunity for a group or company to take advantage of.
