There's a line in html.buildPageTable that sets the fileExtension to .wsf when the page is being served through the website framework responder.<p>

Because of this line, the glossary entry gets wrongly changed.<p>

I think this line should probably be removed. I don't believe it's been there since the start of website framework serving, it's a later addition.<p>

There's an issue of breakage -- what would be the result of removing this line of code? So far I think removing it is harmless, but I'm looking into it. In the meantime, Alan has commented-out that line in his copy of Frontier, and is back to developing his sites.
