Automating the export of SVG, which is an open standard for scalable vector graphics (like the Flash format) would be pretty cool. Imagine having the power of Illustrator's drawing tools reflected in your Flash-like graphics, all of which are drawn on-the-fly, exported as SVG, and rendered in the web browser using Adobe's plug-in. Cool!<p>

<b>Story:</B> A year back or so when I was working at Borders.com, one of our projects was a net-based kiosk terminal that was slated to reside in each of the retail stores. We wanted to be able to display and draw the store maps dynamically (with data pulled from a database) using Macromedia Flash in Internet Explorer. Because of our pre-determined web server requirements, we needed Flash Generator for AIX, and tried like crazy to get Macromedia to supply us with a beta for AIX, but they effectively ignored us. Had we the Applescript/Illustrator/SVG combo at the time, we likely would have jumped on that solution and made it work. Instead, we ended up using large static GIFs (yuck).
