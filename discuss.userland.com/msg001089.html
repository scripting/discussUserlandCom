So far no one has complained about the slow responses during the day. We know about it, and we've got diagnostics running on the server now that give us a much better idea of where it's bogging down.<p>

Doug will be running the server on Friday while I take a day off from Scripting News, he'll be watching the diagnostics and adding more code to pin down the problem. But we're seeing the server bog down visually now, so it can't escape our detection for very long. I want this server to perform incredibly well and we won't rest until it does.<p>

By the way, when you see a cow skull on one of our web pages, you can click on it to read other people's comments, or, if you're a Scripting News member, leave your own comments.<p>
