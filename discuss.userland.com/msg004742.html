Frontier is an outline-based technology that enables collaborative publishing on the web. Making Frontier Technography-compliant is putting icing on the cake. It will allow people to consult collaboratively, do therapy, make sales, plan, design, collaboratively, on the web. <p>

The Microsoft Word outliner is inelegant and buggy. It is geared towards creating paper documents. NetMeetings is less than intuitive and works outside of the Web, and must deal with an overhead that is designed to respond to bandwidth demands far greater than that of technography.<p>

When we succeed in making Frontier a Near-Real-Time medium for collaboration, we will be able to offer the world a flexible, integrated environment that can be made infinitely responsive to the needs of a coworking community.<p>

Use NetMeetings and Microsoft Word. It will give you a good feeling for what Technography can accomplish. It will give you an even better feeling for how profoundly more enabling Frontier can become.
