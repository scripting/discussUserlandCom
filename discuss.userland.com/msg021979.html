I'm still working on the timeless weblog, the non-temporal way of linking to things. We're also getting SOAP interfaces for Manila ready to roll, we have several developers waiting for them, realizing the multi-vendor "Two-Way-Web" <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/03/02/theTwowayweb">vision</a>. What else? The Radio UserLand outliner plays a big role in the timeless weblog, as does Manila. And we bought a new Mac OS X server, it arrived Friday. We'll be hosting sites using the Mac version of Manila, running on Unix, Murphy-willing. Life sure is strange!<br><br>	<a href="http://inessential.com/2000/11/12.html">Brent</a> has a Mac OS X question.<br><br><b>Timeless weblog startup<a name="timelessWeblogStartup">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/12#timelessWeblogStartup" title="Permanent link to 'Timeless weblog startup' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I posted a <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$3400">message</a> to the Radio UserLand discussion group to start the bootstrap process for the timeless weblog idea.<br><br><b>MSIE 5.5 issues<a name="msie55Issues">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/12#msie55Issues" title="Permanent link to 'MSIE 5.5 issues' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Bug report: Text selection in <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/msie55AboutBox.gif">MSIE 5.5</a> textareas appears to be broken. There's no way to select a word without the selection wandering into the word before. The only way I've found to delete 25 characters is to put the cursor at the end and press backspace 25 times.<br><br>	I wish the Find command in MSIE remembered the last string I entered.<br><br><b>Unused domains<a name="unusedDomains">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/12#unusedDomains" title="Permanent link to 'Unused domains' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	An unused UserLand domain is <a href="http://www.featurerequests.com/">FeatureRequests.Com</a>. <br><br>	Last week we finally got Manila sites set up for all our unused domains. We've bought quite a few over the years. We pay for them every year, thinking we'll finally get around to putting some software behind the names. However, the next big service launch will <i>not</i> be FeatureRequests.Com.<br><br><b>Today's song<a name="todaysSong">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/12#todaysSong" title="Permanent link to 'Today's song' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Today's song: <a href="http://www.jonimitchell.com/Ladies70LyricsHome.html">Morning Morgantown</a>. <br><br>	"But the only thing I have to give, to make you smile, to win you with, are all the mornings still to live."<br><br>	<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$846"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/sierraSunsetThumb.gif" height="38" width="50" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></a> Come on America! Let's stop fighting. Adopt the other guy's point of view, or at least understand it. Let's start living some of those commercials. Beautiful Sunday mornings with coffee and kids and walks in the park. Blankets and cats and fireplaces. Thanksgiving. We have a great life here. But we don't listen to each other.<br><br>	I think that's what this michegas is all about. For a moment we're all involved in our own lives, but we're just manipulating symbols. The votes are not who we are. The President is not who we are. Either one will be OK. Let's love ourselves and give ourselves a gift. <br><br>	<i>"We'll wink at total strangers passing."</i><br><br><b>Bonus song<a name="bonusSong">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/12#bonusSong" title="Permanent link to 'Bonus song' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.jmdl.com/lyrics/FreeManInParis.cfm">Free Man in Paris</a>: "I deal with dreamers and telephone screamers."<br><br>	The TV networks want one thing, to keep us glued to our TVs.
