 The url for this site came up in a search for scripting languages,
 and even though it was (and is) hard to grasp what SN is about,
 I was intrigued and began reading the SNews every day.  After about
 a month I took a few hours and said to myself, "Now I have to figure
 out what Frontier and Userland are," and spent a little time poking
 around and reading.  The point is, even without an idea of those
 specifics, I was attracted to free dialog that goes on here.  I can't
 say specifically what I've learned here, but I enjoy the company.
