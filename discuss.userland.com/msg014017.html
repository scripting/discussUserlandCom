I'm using Frontier 4.1 on PowerMac G3 and discovered an interesting (Y2K?) bug. I often have dates parsed from weird formats to DD-MM-YY and since this year, I see strange behaviour when using Date() to do this.<p>

My date format in the control panel is on Dutch (DD-MM-YYYY). Up to last week, dates put in as DD-MM-YY with YY between 40 and 90 coerced fine, but since the start of the new year the statement:
     Date( "27-11-48" )
yields
    "21-10-1912; 17:31:44"
whereas earlier (in 1999) it would yield:
    "27-11-1948; 0:00:00"<p>

Tell me, is this a genuine Y2K bug? Is it a known bug or is it a respected feature? If the latter, what am I missing? Will there be a fix for this, even though it's unsupported software by now?<p>

Sincerely,
Maarten J. Festen (Frontier User since version 2!)
Leeuwarden, the Netherlands.
