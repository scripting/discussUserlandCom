Especially, there was some comparisons regarding performance for different kinds of list handling in UserTalk.<p>

I tried to search for that page at Search.Userland.Com; trying out "list performance", "list comparison", "lists", etc...without any success (but too many hits). Seems to me what is lacking is boolean searches ("list and comparison").<p>

Does anybody know what page/site I am looking for? Or even better, does anybody have some valuable input to the problem I am trying to solve by finding this page:<p>

Is there any better way to build up a list of lists than with this  approach:<p>

newList=true
listIndex=1
for (i=1 to 200)
   newList[listIndex] = &#123; &#123;someValue1,someValue2&#125; &#125;
   listIndex++<p>

Using Frontier v5, this takes too long for my needs.<p>
