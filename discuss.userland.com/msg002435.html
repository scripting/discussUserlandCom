yesterday i did some prototyping on counting link-clicks via cgi-scripts. 
Instead of using plain direct links i used a combination of a cgi-script together with a linktpath as an argument for the cgi.
A method well known to perl-programmers. 
By calling the cgi i first check wether there exists a valid linkpath. 
When a linkpath exists the calling browser is redirected to the specific linkaddress. 
After this i want to to write the information i got from the cgi-call being written directly into a SQL database. 
In Perl this means a straight forward solution by using parent and child processes which enables you to divide the cgi-call into two separate threads which is very efficient . So the user of the browser-client does not have to wait till the complete request has finished.
Now i want to know how to break a frontier-responder into two threads because i cannot see any reason why to make the respondercall longer than necessary.
