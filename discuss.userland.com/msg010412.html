The Hotmail people should be responsible for their own security. It was they who had to open up their system to allow this kind of access by Passport; a properly secured system should check on every sensitive page to make sure there has been a proper login with username and password. It's not that hard, and extra functionality is not worth leaving a gaping security hole.
