We (at the <A HREF="http://iu.berkeley.edu/iu">UC Berkeley Interactive University</A>) are also very interested in promoting Manila in the K-12 world -- in addition to the university world.  Manila is a wonderful product, but more a "hacker tool" (as you wrote) than a polished, finished work that is so usable and so well-documented as to be absolutely compelling to the general web-using public.  <p>

You might be interested to know that about two weeks ago, I asked about where the current intense focus on Radio Userland  <A HREF="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21402">left Userland's work on Manila</A>.  	
Dave <A HREF="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21403">responded</A> that the focus Radio Userland still benefits Manila. 
However, Userland is <A HREF="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21409"> not currently</A> putting any more energy into Manila directly -- and therefore it's not a good time for users to offer input to userland on the future of  Manila. <p>

He added that because the Userland people use Manila internally that they will be motivated to fix it up. (i.e., <A HREF="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21406">"scratch their own itch"</A>).   I <A HREF="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21508">responded</A> that a basic  limit of the "itch scratching" philosophy is that  Manila  then becomes geared to web-savvy folks and not to a larger target audience (such as  the K-12 world). I also asked about what usability testing has been done for Manila.  (I haven't gotten any response to the last post.)<p>

So where does some of us in the Manila community?  I would say in a bit of a bind.  I would walk away from Manila except for the fact that it is the only product that I can find that makes setting up dynamic, content (text)-oriented websites so easy.  I could dig into the guts of Manila and potentially rewrite parts or extend it (via plugins, for example) -- but that's a lot of work, work that I have not been willing to take on so far -- and work that properly belongs to the developers at Userland.
