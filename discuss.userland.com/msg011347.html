The authors suggest using some other protocol (SSH) to encrypt the stream. They have a reasonable argument for leaving better security out of VNC, which makes a lot of sense for UNIX, less for other platforms.  If you're worried about this, it's covered in the <a href=http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/faq.html#q48>FAQ</a> on the site...<p>

Since the VNC server (that part that serves the desktop) requires a password to access, the usual caveats about passwords apply.<p>

The WinVNC server is slower than the others (on Linux it blazes) since the authors don't have the source, and have to guess at how certain things operate.  It's certainly usable.
