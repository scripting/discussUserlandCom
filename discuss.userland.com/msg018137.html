I have a (slightly loony) idea as to what the point of C# is. It's to distract Sun, by taking advantage of the two key features of the mainstream computer industry press.<p>

1. They're fascinated with marketplace wars.<p>

2. They never notice dull, but important technology, no matter how much is spent promoting it, or who does the promoting.<p>

C# looks like a Java knockoff. So the press will imediately start talking about the Java-C# war. But everyone at Microsoft has to know there's nothing particularly compelling about C#, just as there's nothing particularly compelling about Java.<p>

But Microsoft's real weapon against Java, the language is Visual Basic. Always has been. The language isn't as powerful, in many respects, as Java, but it <em>gets</em> COM and Windows in a way that no other language really does. And at the same time C# is released, VB7 will be released -- with most of the 'real OO' features that VB has been missing to date, and likely <em>getting</em> Windows, COM+, and .NET like nothing else does.<p>

So the idea is to keep the anti-Microsoft zealots thinking VB is just a toy language, while serious Windows developers stick with the VB and VC++ they already know.<p>

Does this make sense, or is it just near-midnight typing from someone who has to go to work tommorow?
