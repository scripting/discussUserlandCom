I remember the days of "NCSA What's new ?" where every morning when I was a student in Montreal University, I watch for new site on the earth. It was wonderfull and very passionating. It was an exhaustive journey on many fields you don't know and you learn a lot.<p>

Now you have to select the information and go directly to the information you need, no more surprise.<p>

But Remember....<p>
