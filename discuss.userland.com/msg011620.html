In Scripting's case, I don't think Dave would be too happy with that either, but at least it would eliminate his complaint that it's messing with the look, feel, and content of www.scriptingnews.com.<p>

Third Voice is certainly better than CritLink, because you don't have to download it [on rereading this, I don't know what I was saying here, this is wrong...], and it doesn't copy the pages, just adds a layer on top of it at the client.  Some of us have a problem w/ the whole concept of it...<p>

If someone came up with glasses where anyone looking at your place of business could see comments posted by other people, wouldn't you be a little annoyed?  I think most people would be.
