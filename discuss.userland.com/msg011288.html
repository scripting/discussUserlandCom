See <a href="http://sd.znet.com/~dwlarson/FAT_Pages/MakeThumbNails.html">http://sd.znet.com/~dwlarson/FAT_Pages/MakeThumbNails.html</a> stored as a FatPage.<p>

The scripts at user.CorelPaint could be modified to work with other platforms and scriptable graphic products because it is built in modular fashion.<p>

It works with a single file, groups of files, or a folder of files with error checking. An Error Log is created using the folder drop option if a file can not be processed. If a single file is processed and a bad File Type encountered, then an alert is issued.<p>

There are ReadMe's and a prefs table to use for settings.<p>

XML-RPC enabled capabilities could be considered and implemented in a future release.<p>

I used Heath Tanner's, <a href="http://www.inligo.com/frontier/macros/publishCode.html">publishCode macro</a> on my FatPage to present the script code in html. Thanks Heath!<p>

Have fun!
