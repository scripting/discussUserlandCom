What I discovered is that the two sites have come to cooperate in that when you click on the link it tells mp3.com to download the file to your i-drive account - net to net transfer - which is much faster than downloading it and re-uploading it.  I wouldnt mention this except this seems like such a cool idea for manila stuff.  Imagine going to some science site where you could click to - send to manila or somethign where it knows your id, and it crossloads the file to your manila server - so you can then perhaps do a big batch download later of all the things you've accumulated over time.  <p>

Anyway, it was interesting to me, and it looks like they have some kind of open deal where any site can add links to crossload content to  i-drive.<p>

Another sort of interesting feature is tha you can take and capture any website and download a copy of it to your own space. I assume it only copies single pages at a time.  It's sorta like bookmarks with the touch of having a visual reference to the site - in case the content is very dynamic and you dont want to lose that specific instance of the site....<p>
