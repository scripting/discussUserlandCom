<category aliasto="Syndication/XML">XML/Syndication</category><p>

I wrote a Frontier suite for manipulating and querying categories (actually "nodes"), which dereferences the aliases transparently.<p>

So any operation on XML/Syndication is an operation on Syndication/XML.<p>

This was really useful for the project, which is for a gardening site. Some things, like Bonsai, are hard to classify, but aliases allow you fit the same idea into several categories.<p>

The node suite is as simple as possible: 14 core routines, and 5 utilities. It's also as agnostic as possible about the contents of a node, so it can be easily adapted to other tasks.<p>

Anyway, it's certainly seems (so far) to be a workable approach. The site will be live in a couple of weeks, so I will soon find out!<p>

Let me know if you'd like a copy the code.<p>

Cheers,
