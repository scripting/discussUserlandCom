I don't understand the reluctance to allowing each person or organization to define their own prefix, in a standard way.  That way you can have ScriptingNews:category and Slashdot:category and not be worried about confusing the two category tags.<p>

You might think the namespace for the prefixes might also conflict, and there's an easy solution to that, but it appears to be highly controversal in this thread.
