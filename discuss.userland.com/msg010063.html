Just my opinion, but I think that having it take place at a Open Source convention would lead to at least a perceived problem of audience bias. How much would they actually listen to what Dave has to say if/when he disagreed with ESR?<p>

I think that you need to have a venue where both can speak as equals, and I tend to doubt that that's possible at an Open Source show.<p>

Hey, Dave, want to present your opinions on Perl at <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/main.html">Perl Whirl 2000</a>? <g>
