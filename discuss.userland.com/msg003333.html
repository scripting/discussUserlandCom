All of the information for the application is available at any time via these 'Help' screens.  Whether it be for basic instructions or advanced technical explanations - you can find everything you need in one place.<p>

Basic setup/configure 'wizards' will walk begining user's through logging in and using the application for the first time.<p>

As noted in an earlier message (#3334) this is not a web page but an application.  IE5 gives us advanced control over caching, so that once our Javscript object classes and artwork have been loaded, there's no need to ever reload anything.  All communication with the server happens in real-time and individual 'elements' of the interface can be updated without anything being touched or refreshed.<p>
