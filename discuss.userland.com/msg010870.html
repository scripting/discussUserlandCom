<a href="http://www.zope.org:18200/">Zope.org site</a>.</p><p>

<p>Members get folders where they can add object-based kinds of 
content.  For instance, you can create Links (pointers to 
interesting things on the web), News Items, Formatted Documents, 
Software Products, etc.  Each "kind of thing" has its own form and 
own metadata.</p><p>

<p>There is a common set of metadata for all site content.  One piece 
of metadata is what you've described -- what "kind of thing it is".</p><p>

<p>We have made a 
<a href="http://www.zope.org:18200/Members/Amos/TopicProposal">proposal</a> for another piece of metadata, being which topics something 
belongs to.  This is a modified version of Jon's hybrid approach.  
Namely, there is a facility for people to be given their own 
namespaces.</p><p>

<p>More importantly, a Topic is a site object just like everything 
else.  In Zope this means that a Topic can have things created in it, 
such as images, multiple "pages" that represent it, properties, 
security settings, etc.</p><p>

<p>Our intention is to add RSS "methods" to Topics, thus making any 
Topic a possible channel. </p><p>

<p>I'll make a different post on our spin for top-down vs. bottom-up 
classification schemes.</p>
