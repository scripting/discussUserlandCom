The disussion group interface is driven by the calendar, with messages listed by date. Now, I work in Tokyo and have audiences in Hong Kong, London and New York (just to follow the sun around the globe). When I show up for work in the morning, it's still yesterday in New York (and still business hours yesterday on the West Coast, for that matter).<p>

Hence for my audience group, the daily division is somewhat arbitrary. I suspect this is the case for a lot of us.
