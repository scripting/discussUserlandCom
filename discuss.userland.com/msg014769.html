From what I've seen it's geared towards specific large clients. Current info is in <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/1999/pr1.html">this press release</a>.<p>

One interesting tidbit in that press release is that the authoring tools will change to integrate with the enterprise-level content management system. This implies that Flash, Director, FreeHand and the rest will find it easier to talk with external systems. I'd expect that this might actually *open* new niches for content management systems which are at scales other than the enterprise level.<p>

Kevin's got the better handle on this though... all I know is what I read in the press releases.... ;-)<p>
