Simple put, every human being has an electro-magnetic field around their body. Some peoples are stronger than others, and they have problems with sensitive electronic equipment.<p>

Maybe someone near the box 206.204.31.14 has a strong field?<p>

The best thing about the "bad magnetic field" theory, is that its complete bullshit.
