2.Website, fcgi's fancy scripting I'm on my way<p>

4.Can publish pages dynamically using .wsf<p>

5.Everyone says ".wsf - wow! it's so easy and lightening fast development"<p>

6.Can't find the lightswitch<p>

7.'Sad Mac' user still can't figure out impliment what I can do as a .fcgi as a .wsf - i.e edit frontier stored text objects via a browser.
