Boy some things I said got mangled!<p>

Here's what I said about Microsoft, roughly. It's a story I've been telling to friends, so I know pretty much exactly how it goes. Something like this.<p>

When I was growing up I had two sets of grandparents, one of them were the "fun grandparents." But then I realized a few weeks ago that they really weren't that much fun! <p>

I had the same realization about Microsoft. I appreciate that they listen and respond. As far as platform vendors go they're pretty good. But that's not saying very much! <p>

They listen and then they act with cold-blooded ruthlessnes to lock people into their way of doing things. <p>

Now the quote I gave about Microsoft makes sense. I've asked Microsoft to give it up, most recently in <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/06/21/embraceAndGetOverIt">Embrace and Get Over It</a> and in the piece on <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/06/08/office2000">Office 2000</a>.<p>

As I've said many times here, I am not a Microsoft developer, even though I develop for and use Windows. I am like the people who develop in Java in that I don't want to be captive to Microsoft, but I'm different in that I don't want to be captive to Sun either. <p>

Not being a Microsoft developer is something that Microsoft does not get. But I give them a lot of credit for keeping the conversation going. We speak different languages, but there's a common language of bits and bandwidth and so forth.<p>

<b>I am an Internet developer.</b><p>

We don't need no stinkin platform vendors!<p>

Whatever.
