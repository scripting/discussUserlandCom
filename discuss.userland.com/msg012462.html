I, for one, was a bit disappointed when you went from the Today's Mail format to the DG.<p>

From two purely selfish perspectives: 1) I come to this site for DW's view on the world.  The DG makes getting that a more time-consuming process: I'm sifting instead of reading. 2) If I sent Dave a comment and it made it to Today's Mail, hey, that was a charge!  I was psyched to see it up there.  Of course, with the DG that thrill is gone... I can post whenever I want.<p>

Don't get me wrong, the DG has a lot going for it, adds a lot of value, and has a lot of interesting conversations, but...<p>

So consider this a qualified vote in favor of Today's Mail.  I would miss the DG, but I'd get over it.<p>

And I appreciate what you do here a lot.  I hate to think that you don't enjoy doing it.
