There is a story called:<p>

Faisal Jawdat automates <a href="http://www.faisal.com/docs/frontierDW.html">Dreamweaver with Frontier</a>.<p>

The URL for it is: <a href="http://www.faisal.com/docs/frontierDW.html">http://www.faisal.com/docs/frontierDW.html</a><p>

It relies heavily on BBEdit as an intermediary (both talk to BBEdit), so it only works on a Mac.  I'm a total newby to Frontier (I left the Mac camp for a few years - but I'm back in the fold now, using both NT and a shiny new B&W G3), so I can't add anything to the conversation other than this. <p>

I would like to find out more though.  I like DW - it's nice and fast for edits and creating templates (though hand cleaning is necessary).
If you are able to create Frontier objects for DW I'd download them!<p>

HTH.<p>

I thought about this a little, and it bugged me. 
 
So, I went and searched around in <a href="http://www.dreamweaver.com">http://www.dreamweaver.com</a> for some answers.<p>

All I could find was:<br>
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/dreamweaver/extend.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/dreamweaver/extend.html</a><br>
and <br>
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/download/extensions/">http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/download/extensions/</a><p>

I don't know how helpful that will be, but I know that if you send mail to <a href="mailto:wish-dreamweaver@macromedia.com">wish-dreamweaver@macromedia.com</a> they will see what they can do.<p>

Macromedia seems to really want to make DW the professional's choice for developing, and they don't seem to be shy about collaborative efforts.<p>

I don't see why they wouldn't play.</br></br></br>
