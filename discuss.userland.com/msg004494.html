This translates into something less accurate than a transcription of what was actually said, something slightly more useful but much less satisfactory than a tape recording, something that, once completed, proofread and distributed, still needs verification. And, infallibly, by the time all is said and done, something that assures that most people will forget what was really meant and what actually got done.<p>

Here’s what happens when we use technography: everyone takes responsibility for determining what is being noted, and how. It’s not a transcription. There are discussions that take place around the notetaking that never get recorded. People talk, and then, collectively, everyone decides what of that conversation is noteworthy, and only those statements get recorded. The results: a document that reflects what people want to remember. A document that is edited, approved and distributed before the meeting is over. A document that is owned by everyone.<p>

The role of technographer may in fact be played by the team leader, one who is enlightened enough to be less interested in hearing herself talk and more interested in making sure that everyone leaves the room on the same page, publicly committed to an agreed upon course of action. When she happens to have something to say that she thinks is important enough to go into the group notes, she says it first and waits for someone else to tell her what to write into the record. This way she doesn’t overpower the process (in direct opposition to the adage “he who holds the chalk gets to talk”), is better able to focus the conversation and herself on what she has to say, and gets to discover how well she is being heard.<p>

This is a very big departure from taking notes at a meeting. Very far removed from the role of a transcribing secretary. It’s a redefinition, not only of a traditional role, but also of a traditional meeting. It moves the responsibility for communication from the leader to the group. It challenges almost every assumption you can think of about why meetings are being held and what they are being held for. And yet, in practice, it’s a remarkably practical way to make meetings work.
