Let me just say this much, I don't think this in any way precludes the existence or development of commercial Manila hosting services, in fact I think it will help drive the process. People will become connsoisseurs of fine Manila hosting. (I bet PeterMe and/or NTK will quote me on that.) I don't think ETP.Com will be the highest common denominator there. We'll see. We're learning as we go.<p>

What swayed it for me was this question. Could I imagine telling the most interesting sites on ETP.Com that their trial had run out? I couldn't see it. However, if a site starts getting a lot of traffic, or if they want faster editing turnaround at all hours of the day, they might want to look elsewhere for hosting.<p>

And remember that there's a full programming environment and safe macros, so it's hard to imagine that ETP.Com will always have the latest goodies, and certainly not *all* the goodies. This is just a beginning.<p>

We've made it really easy for people to move their sites off ETP.Com, and we've also released ISP.Root, which makes it easy for service providers to catch them.<p>

BTW, we just got two servers installed at Exodus, one Qube and one NT machine. We're busily moving a site over there. I hope it's faster for people. It's not faster for me (which is an encouraging sign for everyone else!)..<p>

Over and out.
