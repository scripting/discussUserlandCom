Installation was perfect on the PC, and near-perfect on the Mac.<p>

On the Mac, Netscape complained that there was a "conflict" with my NetCenter username "willcate" and required me to pick a new name.  No option to cancel.  The PC setup happily accepted my old name without complaining.  I have no idea why this is; you'd think my username would be platform-independent.<p>

Both platforms seem to work just fine, although the interface is a bit... unusual.  It is quite fast, though, probably faster than MSIE and certainly faster than NS 4.whatever.  Graphics-laden pages load very quickly.<p>

As I'm typing this, I notice that if a word in the textarea field runs to the edge, and extra space appears at the beginning of the next line (small cosmetic problem).<p>

So far, looks pretty damn good!  Way to go, Netscape!<p>
