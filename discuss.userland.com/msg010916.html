<a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1336">RSS moves forward</a>. LinuxToday now supports the new fat format. Thank you very much! Let's keep rollin.<p>

Frontier moves forward too. In version 6.1, coming soon, the scheduler will launch and supervise threads. This makes better-performing server apps easy. An early <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$1356">release</a> is ready for review, including full <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/enclosures/view$1356">source</a>.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10917">More on Marc Andreessen</a>. "I think it's important to separate the person from the myth. Andreessen, like you or me, is a person. I think you can write reviews for software products, you can love or hate a company for its competence or generosity. But you can't review a *person* that way."<p>

<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews">5/6/98</a>: "Hey, one thing's for sure, people think more about rich people, but don't confuse that with listening. Are any of those thoughts grounded in reality? When we talk about Gates are we talking about a man or a huge bank account? I have no idea. Probably neither."<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$10919">I went on a tour</a> of epinions.com, which went live last Wednesday, signed up as a member, almost wrote a review, and made a few hopefully helpful suggestions.<p>

<a href="http://whyy.org/cgi-bin/FAshowretrieve.cgi?2674">NPR's Fresh Air</a> had a show on Tuvan Throat-Singing. This is how I first heard of it.<p>
