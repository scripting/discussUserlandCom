I wish there were a Mac version available so I could try it...<p>

I really like the idea of being able to see others' comments on a site, without the site's interference and without the site having to do the work of providing a comment server.  As a reader, I also really like that I don't have to leave the site -- or do a search with AltaVista or Sherlock and wade through the results! -- to find out what others have to say about it and its content.<p>

What would really be nice, though, is the ability to limit the comments you view to those posted by a particular group or set of individuals (and possibly people who have been recommended by people whose comments you view).  I don't always want to read all the cruft, but I do want to know what my friends may have had to say about a site when I visit it.<p>

Also, rather than viewing comments inline as the Third Voice site describes, viewing them in a separate frame or window would be useful.
