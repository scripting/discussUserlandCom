<cite>Jeffrey Zeldman: The Day the Browser Died. A great piece. I
was reading the HTML version until I found the link to the
text-only version, and what a relief! To me, too much glitz is
too much. Put it all on one page. I know how to use a
scrollbar. No point worrying about CSS and standards. It's a
big dream. Netscape is gone. <blockquote&gt; works great. I
still love Jeffrey. All his icons are in our glossary.</cite><p>

No, no, Jeffrey is a good guy and every people must support the standards. This is the only way to have a powerfull development of the web. We have more and more difficulties to browse the web because people are using High-Technologies.<p>

Dave, you're in United States. But you know there is the world around with slow connections, with slow computers, etc...<p>

Don't make a website for you, but a website for others. The most important is to be read, and to be read, you need to be as simple as possible.<p>

Usability and Standard, that's the way to share the information !
