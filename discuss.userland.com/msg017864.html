All I can find are small quotes, such as this one:<p>

<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-329400.html">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-329400.html</a><p>

I'm curious to find out if the memos are as nefarious as the sound bites make them seem. The quotes are obviously bad by themselves, but what is the context? I could read "we must leverage Windows" as "We must illegally tie IE to Windows in order to crush Netscape." I could also read it as "We must integrate IE with Windows so the the OS and Internet experiences are one and the same."<p>

The latter is plausible to me. I make use of the DAV integration in Windows 2000 on a daily basis, and to me the feature is innovative (hey, my remote web site is just another folder on my system) and a geniune time saver.<p>

But the memo, sans spin, would speak the truth to me.<p>
