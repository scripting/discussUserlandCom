It may be difficult, but it's possible to use JavaScript to submit a form via POST. And it's not that really difficult -- in fact, some people on this dg are probably running such code multiple times a day without necessarily knowing it.<p>

Manila does use POST requests pretty much every time content can be changed. Even though that makes Manila more secure than systems that use args in the URL, it's not enough. So a referer check is still a good idea.
