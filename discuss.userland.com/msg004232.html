If IIS on NT really runs faster than Apache on OS X, does it mean that OS X is not faster than NT on hosting a webserver? No, it only means that, as you suggested, IIS is highly optimized! But there is nothing can stop another company to write a highly optimized webserver for OS X.

Here's the funny thing. Webten on MacOS, still beats Apache on OSX, according to Tenon (this is from the WebTEN mailing list):<p>

"... that you will have the same kind of major performance
 advantage that you now enjoy with WebTen on Mac OS; Apple's included
 Apache has been benchmarked by Ziff Davis on a 400MHz machine as 
 sustaining 740 hits/second -- less than the 1000 hits/second 
 sustained by WebTen on a 266MHz Mac OS machine!!"<p>

PS. Tenon is shipping WebTEN for OSX.
