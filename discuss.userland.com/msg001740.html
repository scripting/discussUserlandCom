I got a great deal on two identical 8MB PCI Matrox Millenium G200 cards today at the local computer store.  Sooo, I installed them, and now I have two monitors hooked up to my NT 4 workstation (and my Linux box is headless -- but that's okay, right? ;-))<p>

My old resolution: 1024x768
My new resolution: (800x600)x2 == 1600x600 :-)<p>

If I ever get a decent 2nd monitor, I'll be able to run them both at 1024x768... sweeeeet.<p>

It's pretty neat, I can move a window from one screen to the other... I'm going to keep my e-mail program on the second screen, and use the first one for day-to-day stuff (since it's a much nicer monitor).<p>

Now is when I wish Frontier had an SDI interface instead of (or in addition to) an MDI interface. I understand that on a Mac with more than one monitor I can have the Frontier menubar on one monitor, and freely move windows from monitor to monitor.<p>

Well, I can do that on NT too, but I have to resize the MDI window to cover up the other windows on both monitors, killing the usefulness of having two monitors in the first place.<p>

I wanted to mention this because I'm a data-point now... there's at least one UserLand customer with multiple monitors on NT now who'd appreciate SDI support in Frontier.<p>

I'm absolutely not suggesting "implement SDI because there's a dual-monitor guy out there", but if you get enough people letting you know they have dual-monitors, or would really like SDI, perhaps that would be different.<p>

I don't ask for much, do I? ;-)<p>

I hope everyone had a good xmas...<p>

Happy New Year,<p>
