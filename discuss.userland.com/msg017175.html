Yes, this is technically known as password-equivalence.<p>

<i>One approach is to use a challenge and response during the same connection, and repeat that every time someone connects, but HTTP is usually connectionless.</i><p>

HTTP/1.1 already has a standard challenge-response authentication scheme called digest authentication. However, even digest auth is vulnerable to <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/srp/issues.html#dictionary">offline guessing attacks</a>.<p>

<i>Perhaps it all needs to happen over SSL.</i><p>

Even though SSL can be leak passwords during man-in-the-middle attacks, I think this is the most practical solution.
