<p>Just one quick expansion on that thought, then. Asking questions about someone, even if they're construed as rude, is still acknowledging that the person deserves enough of your attention to be asked the question.</p>
<p>Consider Cam's comments about Dave. He says that he's losing respect for Dave, etc., but his actions say otherwise because he keeps coming back and saying more.</p>
<p>To show ultimate disrespect is to ignore everything the person says or does, to act as if the person doesn't exist.</p>
