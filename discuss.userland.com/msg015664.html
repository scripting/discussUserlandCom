<I>Spending 10-20 minutes registering each time you need to shop or join a conversation? How much time do you spend paying at a fast food joint? 15 seconds?<p>

This is a real problem. The answer is the creation of infomediaries; firms to whom you entrust your data and who put it use for you.</I><p>

I'm not at all sure I agree with this conclusion; centralizing control of such personal information seems like an excruciatingly bad idea.<p>

This is one area where open research on open systems to address the issue, with open implementations that anyone can set up services to support, whether for a (closed) local group or publicly, seems to be a good idea.<p>
