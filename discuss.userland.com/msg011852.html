There is a confusion going on regarding the backslashes.  It doesn't seem to matter how many backslahes I put in.  It is on the back burner now as I have found a different way of achieving my goal which does not involve literal addresses (and has work out to be quicker).<br><br>
When I have time I will sort it all out and write a piece on Mac to PC conversions.<br>
Have a good weekend folks!<br>
