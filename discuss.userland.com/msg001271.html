Welcome. Long time! How are you? <p>

Yes there is a lot of lying out there. And in here too. I catch myself lying to myself all the time. It's a constant battle to reconnect with the truth.<p>

I don't know what to do about it other than always be thinking and comparing reality to the story that's spinning around (the lie).<p>

The problem is that if you build a system on lies, it's not very strong. And the more its built on lies the louder people shout at you when you try to tell the truth.<p>

For whatever reason getting caught in that kind of morass makes me more angry than most people. <p>
