Somehow I managed to miss that with the main focus in the news on the C# standard. But the ecma site confirms it -- I can almost believe it...<p>

Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)  
 This single, rich language infrastructure supports C# and (optionally) ECMAScript and other modern languages.  <p>

The CLI effort would include specification of the following:
    * A common set of datatypes used across all supported programming languages
    * A standard XML-based declarative syntax for specifying objects, methods, and datatypes
    * A small set of base classes that provide language support and basic application portability
    * A common intermediate language format for code download and execution, along with metadata that describes the requirements and capabilities of the code
    * A common code verification and execution model with capability limitations depending on context
