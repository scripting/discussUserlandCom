"Every year for the last decade, Microsoft's share of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems has stood above ninety percent. For the last couple of years the figure has been at least ninety-five percent, and the analysts project that the share will climb even higher over the next few years."<p>

<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/eclectic/">Eclectic</a> is a weblog that covers the XML-DEV mail list. Leigh Dodds reads every message and points to the interesting ones. It's now a Manila site. Leigh got the site up in less than a half hour! That's got to be some kind of record. <p>

<a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$632">Andrew Wooldridge</a> asks for help with XML-RPC. He's working on the connection between Dreamweaver and Manila, so if someone who knows the technology could help him out, we'd get more beautiful websites sooner. <i>Thanks!</i><p>

There was a <a href="http://www.deja.com/=dnc/dnquery.xp?ST=PS&groups=deja.comm.weblogs">weblog newsgroup</a> on Deja.Com. <i>Last post was in August.</i><p>

SendMail.Net: <a href="http://www.sendmail.net/?CssUID=&CssServer=&SessionName=&feed=interview000lisa01">Vixie Wraps Bind</a>. "I'm coming up on ten years working with BIND, and now that the fresh, clean, from-scratch implementation has none of my code in it, I'm pretty much planning to retire from BIND. Ten years is a long time."<p>

We've got a slogan for Manila, it goes like this. "I'm a newbie, she's a newbie, we are newbies, wouldn't you like to be a newbie too?" (Sung to the tune of the old <a href="http://www.scripting.com/wavs/pepper.wav">Dr Pepper jingle</a>.) The point being, we're all newbies here, in case that wasn't clear! ";->"<p>

MacWEEK has compiled a <a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/1999/11/07/findings/">table of contents</a> for the Jackson findings, with links to 16 sections that refer specifically to Apple. (This is a very interesting site, done with Frontier, I wonder how.)<p>

Heads-up to people in the weblog community. I'm doing an application that works like <a href="http://www.linkwatcher.com/metalog/">LinkWatcher</a>. It will keep an hourly listing of weblogs that changed in reverse-chronologic order. I'm also doing it as sample code for Frontier users to help teach how the My.UserLand aggregator works. The app is far simpler than My.UserLand, it doesn't do any parsing. LinkWatcher is great but it doesn't scan that frequently. I've gotten a few questions about the scanner, I guess it's showing up in people's logs, hopefully this should answer them. If you'd rather we didn't scan your weblog, it'll be easy to opt-out.<p>

Industry Standard: <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/articles/display/0,1449,7541,00.html">Microsoft Wins Browser War</a>. "Microsoft's IE is the primary choice for 64 percent of respondents to the October survey, compared to 36 percent for Navigator. In April, the figures were 59-41 in Microsoft's favor, while as recently as October 1998, Navigator held a 60-40 lead." <i>Note to Linux, don't start wars!</i> ";->"<p>

CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9911/10/BeOS/index.html">Tiny Be carves out niche in vast Microsoft-owned pie</a>. "So what does Be have on its side? Be's operating system, according to the company, is clean, stable and a whiz at handling multimedia tasks." <i>Go Be! Go Be!</i><p>

See the difference in approach? <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/search?q=gassee&site=DaveNet&m=50">JLG</a> is a master of expectations. There's nowhere but up from here. By aspiring to dominance, Linux, as Netscape before it, sets itself up to be torn down, piece by piece. Better to be humble. <i>Who me? Dominate? No way!</i><p>

Hey get this, they're still publishing <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/mad/previews/mad20.jpg">Mad Magazine</a>. <i>What me worry?</i><p>
