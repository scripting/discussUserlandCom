I wouldn't use Frontier, if I'd want work with Perl! The whole
Frontier stuff is based on UserTalk (the responders, the templates the suites I'd use and all this).
UserTalk is currently parsed and executed only by Frontier itself.<p>

I understand, that I can make calls to other script languages (and applications) if they provide an
XML-RPC interface - but this is acutally only a fancy thing if you are going to use other script
languages. I really don't want to use more script languages than absolutly necessary! That will
increase the complexity of projects and the amount of skills (and people) needed to complete them.</i><p>

If unfortunately you don't have a Mac/Win box that run as a server, I don't see how you will be able to use Frontier to handle CGIs. That's why I suggested to use Perl for that. <p>

Frontier don't run on Unix, Perl do. The idea is not so much to call Perl from Frontier, but to use a different framework for CGIs.<p>

If you need a page with a form for a guessbook, you include in your Frontier page a Perl script that will do that. Then you can ask Perl to send you by mail the result, or ask Frontier to get the file on the Unix box.<p>

Now if you want to build a complex project around Frontier that include CGIs, and if you don't want to learn Perl, buy a Mac/NT box, and loan a line from your ISP.<p>

BTW, if you learned UserTalk, I don't see why you can't learn  Perl.<p>

HTH
