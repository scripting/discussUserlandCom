One of my dinner friends said that's crazy. So I said OK, you have a parachute. Later I thought about it and realized that there is no parachute. Not only do you have to create the parachute while you're in free-fall, you also have to invent the damned thing!"</i>

Don't you also need to check for the patent on the parachute before you start to invent it? ;-)
