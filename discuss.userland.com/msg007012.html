yes, indeed installing frontier 6 and implementing all the new frontier functionalities is very exciting and keeps you busy for ours.
after having programmed the last 6 month exclusively with tango and Oracle its funny to come back to Frontier. With a lot of help from the frontier stuff / especially Andre Radke / frontier is becoming more powerful for me every day. this time it is a real adventure cause we are going to build an intranet for several hundred people at the  center of art and mediatechnology in karlsruhe / germany. 
that&#180;s the good part<p>

the bad part is that the search engine is still not working for me. i followed the howtos very carefully, studied the source code patiently.i am convinced that i installed all necessary #search-tables at the right place with the right parameters. but when i post or edit a new text to or inside of the DG no address-entry gets created at mainresponder.data.searchQueue.<p>

even though i have a lot of experiance in programming frontier i have to admit that it is not that easy to follow the new frontier functionalities through all the new guest database tables. on the other side i start to feel more and more comfortable with frontier 6 the more i work with it.<p>

 
so, dig we must, by tom
