The biggest problem is that because of Java security settings, the Java code has to come from the same server you want to talk to over XML-RPC. The good news is that the HTML pages containing the applet don't have to come from that server. <p>

So, if you agree to put the applet jar file somewhere on the MTTF server, people all over the net could start experimenting with it. The applet is ready, but it's useless without some docs. I guess I'll do that tomorrow (it's 6:30 PM here).
