Aren't they the only politicians who you could reasonably hope would repeal such an outrageous law? Maybe having a man who has "been there, done that" will be helpful.</i><p>

Would you vote for such a left-handed politician who hid that fact while actively pursuing the "War on Left-handers"?<p>

G W Bush is already a governor and had his chance to show how compassionate his experience has made him. When he pardons the people who are still in prison for doing no more than what he seems to have done and have been clean for no less time than he has, then he has a right to ask people to ignore his past.<p>

It isn't a matter of prying into politicians' private lives or even of holding them to a higher standard than others. What does it say about him that he advocates spending billions to put countless people in prison for doing no more than what he did?<p>

<i>Two wrongs don't make a right, and do unto others.</i><p>

So don't put him in prison for a victimless crime in his past. But you don't have to elect the hypocrite.
