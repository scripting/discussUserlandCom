The app should support XML-RPC, so it can be integrated into a content management system. I'd like to develop a template slot in Frontier and connect it to an XML-RPC call, and that would connect to a command in DreamWeaver's menu bar. The same slot could be in Zope. That's the connection that makes the most sense to me. The market would *inhale* it; it would be like Kurt Vonnegut's ICE-9. (PS: Same for Adobe's apps.)<p>

Afterthought: Apache could learn how to do templates? I bet the folks at Macromedia would find that interesting.
