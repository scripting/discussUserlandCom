I was wondering if anyone's come up with a list of the sites that allow you to enter your syndication information -- I know about My.Userland and about the Weblog Monitor, but other than that, I think that Netscape has one, but that's it.<p>

Is it about time to maintain an authoritative source on this?<p>

(After jumping onto the EditThisPage bandwagon today, I quickly banged together <a href="http://queso.editThisPage.com/">my own site</a>, and now want to see what my syndication options are!)<p>

Thanks....
