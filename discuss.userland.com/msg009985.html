Feklempt, which is almost certainly mis-spelled, is Yiddish. Precisely
translated it means "breathless with excitement and pride." Both those
elements are necessary, excitement and pride.<p>

There's a Mike Myers skit on Saturday Night Live where he plays (in drag) a
mediocre NYC woman with her own TV show. I don't remember her name, maybe
Kitty? She's very Jewish. At least once in each skit she puts her palm to
her chest and exclaims "I'm feklempt!!". Once it was because Barbra
Streisand showed up as a surprise guest. In NY Jewish culture a visit from
Barbra Streisand is the ultimate in feklempt experience.<p>

That's how I felt when I saw James' page. Excitement that I would feel if he
had done the work in any web environment, and huge pride because the work
was done in *my* web environment.
