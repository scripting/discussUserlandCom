As for the Debian Free Software Guidelines and the Open Source Definition: Both say that a license must not discriminate against a field of endeavor. (That's Point #6, which you didn't quote above.) The GPL does discriminate against the creation of commercial software, and therefore is not an open source or "DFSG-Free" license. The person who constructed the page you cite -- Bruce Perens -- has a conflict of interest because he serves on the Board of Directors of a Linux company. The GPL's <i>stated purpose</i> is to discriminate against a field of endeavor, and therefore it does not qualify under either definition.
