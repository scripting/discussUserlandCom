i read scripting news several times a day, and have for years.  i love frontier, but the learning curve...  i just can't get motivated.  i would be happy to pay any licensing fee required, or even the development costs.  in the mean time, take a look at a couple of programs that i have found that are usefull.  i understand that they are not XML-RPC and they only grab the page and do simple work on it, but for me, the moron, getting the right data is the first hurdle.  if i can't get the data then nothing else matters.<p>

obviously, there is "frontier" which we all love, but i also use
<a href=http://www.newsclipper.com>newsclipper</a> and
<a href=http://www.chimerasoft.com/chimerasoft/netreaper>netreaper</a>
to gather my info before i publish it to my site.<p>

i hope that this input helps, and if anyone takes a look at this software and says "hey, that would be an easy interface to code into frontier" - let me know!
