Why can't this be done for IM? If you connect to this IM server, you need to display XX ad's an hour, from this URL. Everytime you open an IM window, and ad should be fetched from this URL. It needs to be built into the standard.<p>

Personally, MSN mess is a pure rip off of IM. It looks like AOL IM (withotu the organized buddy list). It acts like AOL IM. It adds one thing: integration with Outlook, and does you hotmail checking for you. It's worst thing is it's integration with outlook. MSN Mess starts up with outlook, and does not go away when you shutdown outlook. And you can't turn off this behavior.<p>
