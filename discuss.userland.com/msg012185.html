When you're an Internet company, it doesn't really matter (at first glance anyway) what your technology is, as long as you can keep your site running well. The tech is an infrastructure that everyone sort of assumes will be there, and from there it's all market positioning and branding.<p>But do you really think it's generally true? Is the tech thought of as such a commodity that a tool-building company can't raise serious money?</p></p>
