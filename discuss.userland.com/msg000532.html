I want to thank you as President of UserLand Software for your vision of where Frontier can go.  I also want to thank the rest of your team, Brent, Doug, and Robert for their development as well as their support.<p>

And to echo Dave's comments, I want to thank the Frontier community for their continued mastery of an incredible product.<p>
