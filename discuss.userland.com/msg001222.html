I sent the following to all members of the House who have email addresses.  I understand your position, but I don't think that Clinton has commited any crimes worth of being considered "high" or has subverted the Constitution.<p>

Dear Representative:<p>

Over and over, I hear people telling you and me "what Americans want" and "what Americans believe".  Each repetition makes me feel increasinging disenfranchised.<p>

I do NOT want the House to impeach the President. I do not belive that the evidence supports the allegation that the President has commited constitutional crimes that demand removal from office.<p>

I urge you to apply your highest standards of intellectual rigor and legal reasoning and ask you to judge whether this president has acted to harm the Constitution, government and people of the United States.  I urge you to find that he has not and to reject this attempt to overturn the election of 1996.
