... what if Bill Clinton was actually a deep sleeper Chinese agent who wanted to destroy the USA?  What would he do?<p>

Would he allow secret missile and bomb technology to be leaked and sold to China?  Would he take money from China to help his election campaign?  Would he drive out all competent officers from the military command structure by a concerted program of political appointments, micromanagement, harrasment with "don't ask don't tell" and other directives?  Would he so cut funding that pilots are seriously out of practise and maintainance on their aircraft is sub standard?  Would he use up the entire US inventory of cruise missiles in pointless attacks on Sudan and Yugoslavia that acheive no military aim but get the whole world pissed off at the USA?  Would he use up the entire US inventory of precision-guided (laser) bombs in the same pointless and ineffective attacks?  Would he make sure that no replacement cruise missiles and smart bombs are ordered?  Would he finally create some pretext for China to attack the USA?<p>


Of course I don't think Clinton is a Chinese agent.  That's crazy.  Bill Clinton clearly means well, everything he has done has been with the best of intentions and it's just unfortunate coincidence if the effect has been to destroy the US as an effective and respected military force.  It was for the children.<p>

But what would a Chinese agent have done differently?
