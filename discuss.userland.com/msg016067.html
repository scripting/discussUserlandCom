They're going more for the "cool factor" than actual usability. Skins are just one of the symptoms. Take a look at Kai Power Tools, Bryce 3D, QuickTime 4 or even WinAmp. There's no attempt what-so-ever to compliment the OS. How much is wasted trying to figure out the UI. "What's that little green dot in the corner do?"
