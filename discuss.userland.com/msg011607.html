and I got a very weird page.<p>

The content of my weblog was all wrong, but on the
TEXTAREA field my content was showing up ok.<p>

I tryed to update but I got to the same page
with the TEXTAREA updated but with the top
section of the page with the messy content from
someone elses weblog.<p>

I clicked on the channel name to see how it was
showing up to the other users and my cotent showed
up ok but without the update.<p>

I guess there's something weird going on here...<p>

                           Greetings,
                           Vitor.
