This stuff still works and I love it! My only fear is that as my operating system moves along MORE will stop working. May that day be far away.<p>

My favorite feature as a writer and world class note-taker (wink) has to be Hoist. It's a simple idea but allows me to refocus my attention and ideas within the context of a larger document. The best features are always simple.<p>

I've had to use Word for the first time these past 4 days (I've been a Claris Works user for a long time) and my first run experience with it has been a strong counterpoint to my first experiences with MORE. There's hope for the software world yet. Maybe newer developers can take a look at simple powerful apps and learn something about feature set. I need my software to do something and do it right.<p>
