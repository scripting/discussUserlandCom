I am against software patents, so I can't say I'm not against anything. And I am against dividing software developers along arbitrary lines. I hate this the most. I think Linux and the Mac and even Windows have the most to gain by connecting to each other. In the end I think that's why IBM was able to persuade Sun to endorse SOAP -- it's good for Java to connect to everything. <p>

BTW, that could be the banner everyone waves. SOAP is cool. Or we could wave it around XML-RPC, that would be OK with me too. We could even do another rev of the spec that addresses Ken's concerns, now that I understand what they are.<p>

There are so many possibilities if we just recognize each other. Route around stinkers like Stallman and even Bill Gates. There's a separate thread going on offline about Gates. He's a stinker for sure. Let's get him to clean up the mess he created. There I have access, btw. I might not be able to get through to Linus, but if there's something to say to Gates, I believe he'll listen.
