that let's people know where they should be going. I hope that JV and his staff are watching their error log closely, and putting explinations of the new system into files located at those error points.<p>

It was strange, I'm on the Palmpilot version of the Top Stories all day long. I probably noticed the change over within 5 minutes of it going live. For the entire backend to switch over so quickly was pretty amazing.<p>

But I'm curious as to why they did it in the middle of the day. It must have been about 3:00 or so in the afternoon when it happened.
