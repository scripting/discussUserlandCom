A big part of the RIAA's misinformation campaign is based on the fact that "artists are getting ripped off." Are they compensating artists for files that are being downloaded via WinAmp? Are they paying ASCAP and BMI royalites on each download so that songwriters get their cut? What about music from other lablels?<p>

The Winamp not only relevant to the Napster lawsuit, it is the ultimate hypocracy. I'm waiting to see how RIAA is going to spin this.<p>
