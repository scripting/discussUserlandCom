The plan is shaping up nicely. One of the things we wanted to do is to take a reading on how we're doing, given the recent release of Frontier 5.1.5.<p>

So, if you've upgraded from 5.1.4 to 5.1.5, did we fix important bugs? Is it performing better? Are you using guest databases? What features are you looking for in Frontier 6 and beyond?<p>
