<I>Second, I have a recent experience, the acqusition of Alexa by Amazon, where there probably was a complete reversal on a promise made by Netscape and Alexa. It's hard to check this out because Netscape was acquired too.</I><p>

Which promise?  Note that Alexa has no control over the question of whether or not the Netscape browser 'What's Related' feature sends all your Websurfing to the Netscape servers; that's purely in Netscape's hands.  The privacy statement on Alexa's Web site hasn't changed that I can see.  So as per your recent request to the gentleman who made stuff up about what you should think regarding story scraping, I'm asking. :)  If, of course, it's something you can disclose -- I know some things are confidential.
