For example, RedHat and several other companies already provide phone support service for Linux.<p>

Eazel's focus (or one of them, that I've heard) is on providing automatic update service (not for one particular package, but for an entire distribution, say RedHat or Debian).  They take a "somewhat stable" distribution (like RedHat's RawHide), and provide somewhat tested automatic updates.  Their success will depend on some Q/A testing of what will be updated, before sending out the updates to users.<p>

The risk is that there are already several "auto-updaters" already available, for free (gratis and libre) for Linux.  Anyone can pick a stable, semi-stable, or development tree as the source for auto-updates.<p>

I think Eazel's focus is the user experience around the auto-update feature.
