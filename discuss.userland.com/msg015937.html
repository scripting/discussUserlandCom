If you manage or develop your companies web server, or simply know about the technology involved, I would be extremely grateful if you could fill out a short survey to help with my research. The survey can be found at <a href="http://asp.soc.staffs.ac.uk/tj900498/aspsurvey.asp">http://asp.soc.staffs.ac.uk/tj900498/aspsurvey.asp</a>
The survey will take literally 2 minutes to complete. None of the questions are compulsory but I would appreciate it if you could complete the survey to the best of your knowledge. If you consider any of the questions to be confidential then do not answer them.
Thanks for your co-operation.<p>
