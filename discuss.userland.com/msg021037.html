Because, as you pointed out today, <a href="http://www.suck.com/daily/2000/09/08/daily.html">lawyers rule the world</a>.<p>

As for having fun: This is what Guido is trying to do, more or less. He wants to play nicely with everyone: commerical developers, proprietary developers, GPL'd developers, and so forth.<p>

But he can't do this, because his former employer owns huge chunks of Python, and told him he had to use a long, messy license.<p>

I'm going to rewrite my piece until it makes slightly more sense. ;-)<p>
