I think this issue of Scripting News was a real classic! It struck so many chords with me.<p>

It's a pity that your search on News.com for Userland came up with nothing. Every day I search <a href="http://www.jobserve.com">Jobserve</a>, the UK's leading IT vacancies site looking for leads on which I can follow up. I always search for Userland and Frontier because we like working with those tools but there is never anything there.<p>

I take your point that those in the open development arena ought to have a weblog but how to find the time?<p>

Thanks again,<br>
Colin
