At the time they said it was a cold. Later they said it was a stroke. I felt so bad about this. I wish him the best, get well soon. <br><br>	<i>He's 87 years old</i> and frail. I actually shook his hand once, when he was President, and he came to speak at Tulane. He said something nice about our school. Not many people did in those days.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/NixonElvis.html"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/trickyDickThumb.gif" height="35" width="36" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right"></a> People always laughed at him, but he's a nice guy and he became President in a shitty way. (He also pardoned <a href="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/NixonElvis.html">Tricky Dick</a>, so let's not go overboard.)<br><br><b>Our inspiration?<a name="ourInspiration">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/02#ourInspiration" title="Permanent link to 'Our inspiration?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/radioExe.gif" hspace="10" vspace="0" align="right">Some people think that the Radio.exe icon is Gerald Ford.
