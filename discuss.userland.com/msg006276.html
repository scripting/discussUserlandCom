We are. The new focus is on user interface. This is just the first dividend from that focus. More are in the pipe. <p>

Re handling comments, not toooooo likely. Look at the code, it's just calling xml.compile to build the structure. It doesn't understand anything about outlines or comments. To add support for that would require a whole new architecture be built inside xml.compile. That would not be a good use of our development resources at this time.
