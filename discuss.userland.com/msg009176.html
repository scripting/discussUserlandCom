The requirements for a standard instant messaging and presence protocol are still under active discussion, though this discussion is nearing a close and protocol design can probably begin soon.<p>

Why is this important?  The participants -- and the IETF as a whole -- take developing scalable, secure systems very seriously.  You can't get a truly scalable, truly secure system without a lot of up-front design work.  It's also important to build on the work others have done and to learn from their mistake; participating in the IMPP discussions are developers and administrators of nearly all of the Internet instant messaging systems that are currently deployed.<p>

As for using HTTP, the Internet Engineering Steering Group has some words on that at <<a href="ftp://ftp.ietf.org//internet-drafts/draft-iesg-using-http-00.txt">ftp://ftp.ietf.org//internet-drafts/draft-iesg-using-http-00.txt</a>>.<p>

I cannot reccommend strongly enough that any new protocol development be done under the auspices of the IETF and through its protocol-development process.  Yeah, it takes time, and it can occasionally be a frustratingly cooperative effort, but communications protocols are too important nowadays to leave to vendor consortia or to any process that isn't completely open and inclusive.
