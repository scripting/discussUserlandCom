But nonetheless, the inference is being made.  I hadn't thought about it this way until I read Richard's post -- where's the discussion about sexual harrassment coming from?  Clinton has never been accused of harrassing Lewinsky (at least that I know of, and I just spent some time on the major news sites making sure that I could say that confidently).<p>

If anyone's beef with Clinton is re: sexual harrassment, then it doesn't seem logical for that person to support the current proceedings, since that's not what they're about.  Same thing if I didn't like him because he bribed a political figure, or embezzled money, or killed someone -- I'd want to see him tried for THOSE, but this partisan mess is NOT something that I'd support.<p>
