I know Adobe has the HTML to PDF feature in Acrobat 4.0, but it's yet another big application to buy and load. If this little app can do most of what I need for the $US 99 support fee, I'll be happy.<p>

The web app on the Acrobat site requires a monthly or annual subscription, and it's not necessarily immediate feedback. Besides, it's a good idea but a horrible use of net bandwidth. Most of us have fast CPUs on our desks, why not use them for stuff they're good at, like format conversion...<p>

I'll keep the group updated on my progress with this product.<p>

Cheers, Ralph Hempel P.Eng.
