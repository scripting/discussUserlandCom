(i.e, that would look like @["Tempest:Applications:Database Spreadsheet:UserLand Frontier™:Frontier:Guest Databases:www:KitSuite.root"].KitSuite.Scripts.mEudora).<p>

Now, of course, having to make a call like ["Tempest:Applications:Database Spreadsheet:UserLand Frontier™:Frontier:Guest Databases:www:KitSuite.root"].KitSuite.Scripts.mEudora.zeroWindow () is even less desirable.  Any workarounds for this?<p>

I'm not even using frontier to compile webpages with this script.  It's called with QuickKeys from various applications and straightens and cleans up their windows.
