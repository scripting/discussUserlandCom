Thought that might come up.<p>

Firewalling content is a tricky business; it's impossible to do more than keep tabs on general trends, and do keyword searches with copious logging. I spent the past year and a half babysitting just two of many at a Fortune 25 company, and it's not fun.<p>

HTTP presents its own problems. Sure, you can use filters, but there are plenty of reports about how ineffective they are. Logfiles are absurdly copious; analysing the traffic is difficult and big-brother-ish. <p>

A competent user can get ANYTHING through a firewall that allows HTTP access; filtering is easy to overcome with anonymisers and URL scrambling proxies. <p>

The real kicker is that if your firewall allows secure connections, you have the ability to create a two-way tunnel to the outside world (with CONNECT); at the most, it'll be restricted to just port 443. Since SSL is resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks, it's a gaping hole with no oversight (there is acutally a theoretical way to stop this, but it's not pretty).<p>

Looking at it from the other side, you'll never stop a determined user from getting to the outside, but you can open up content and get the most popular ones (like XML-RPC, if desired). All that's required is that it is readily identifiable in a standard way.<p>

These are the issues that corporations need to come to terms with very quickly. Already, big companies are finding that a significant portion of their employees are using services like Hotmail to do company business, because they're so easy to use. They can block most of this type of use with a large investment in software and staff to manage the firewall, but not all of it.<p>

It all begs the question-- when did the firewall become a means of keeping people in, rather than out? A company certainly needs to keep tabs on it, but controlling external access at a fine-grained level is asking for trouble, IMHO.
