I don't think I agree with your characterization of text editors. I think "browser" has a more specific meaning than just "a program that displays text." A web browser displays marked-up text, as well as graphics and whatever else has been stuffed into a plug-in or baked into the app. A text editor displays text, and has lots of powerful tools for editing text. Designing a good text editor takes lots of work. Designing a good browser takes lots of work. Designing something that does both well, I think the amount of work multiplies rather than just adding. <p>

In general, I find that small programs that each concentrate on doing one thing well, and communicate with each other through an open, non-proprietary standard, work better than bloated swiss-army-knife apps that try to be everything to everybody.
