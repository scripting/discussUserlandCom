Absolutely, in an economic sense. I think publishers who are trying to earn a buck really want their content to be viewed by as many people as possible. But I think sometimes we think of things only in an economic sense. To me, the issue of copyright is much more than just "who gets paid."<p>

Take for example the sculptor who created the freize that is over the entry way for the National Cathedral. A near-replica of his work was used in the movie "Devil's Advocate" without his permission. He sued (and I believe he won) to have the image removed from the film.<p>

His complaint wasn't economic -- he wasn't interested in just getting paid for the use of his work. His objection was that the work was used in what he considered a profane way, i.e. he didn't like the way his work was portrayed.<p>

Just an example to show that it's not always about money and eyeballs. People have multiple, valid reasons to want to control how their creative products are used and portrayed. Copyright law has been dealing with deciding what is fair use for a long time. I guess I'm just amazed at how flagrantly it is violated on the web just because the technology makes it easier to do.<p>

I think I'm up to 6 cents in this conversation ;-)<p>
