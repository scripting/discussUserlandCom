It <i>was</i> pretty cool at the time, but only if you were a developer, and were using the platform that Gold existed on. (Windows only for a long time.)<p>

What Dave is creating removes the "you have to be a developer to use" aspect of web content creation. It also lowers the granularity of editing to the paragraph(?) level. No need to dig through the code of a large page to find the bit you're editing- just scroll to it in the browser, and hit the button. Now <i>That's Hot</i>. This is going to go a long way to revolutionizing web publishing.<p>
