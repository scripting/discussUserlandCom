I want it in the table, because I want all the data related to an entity stored in one place.  Yes, I suppose I could use #'s in front of the private entries, and probably will...but it seems clumsy to me.  The information I'm talking about isn't really "directives", it's content...just content that should only be seen by authorized users.
