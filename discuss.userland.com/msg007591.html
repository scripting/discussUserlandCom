I've been thinking about adding to the <scriptingNews> format, allowing full stories to appear in the XML.<p>

There's a single compelling reason for this, one that could be quite revolutionary for people who use handheld computers. It might relate to accessibility too, which is a hot issue.<p>

If the text of the story is included we can render it according to user preferences. So if we know if the client is a palmtop we could do something like what we do for the Avantgo version of Scripting News.<p>

It would be an optional feature, probably only viable for people doing their sites in a CMS.
