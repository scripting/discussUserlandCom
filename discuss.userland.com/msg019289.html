It was great this morning to come to my computer and read your yesterday piece about software and Standards.<p>

In fact, I understand your point of view, but I not really agree with it, because it's a short view (with all respect I should have). The fact is that we need standards, we really need standards, that's the story of our life. <b>Standards are a guarantee of Interoperability.</b><p>

The standards are not here to frustate industry or people, but to guarantee to people to make products which can evolve and be innovative in a stable Market Ecology.<p>

Napster had a great success, because it uses TCP/IP, Ethernet, etc... (standards). Imagine that this company decides to have his own protocol, it couldn't have success.<p>

For the Web, W3C is here to maintain a Web Ecology where people could evolve with harmony and being sure that they work will be operable in all software. Imagine a world where Netscape and Microsoft took two opposite directions, meaning that when you browse the web, you need two applications to see websites... It's why I hate the mention, designed for... The Web must be viewable by everyone (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Points/">http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Points/</a>). Standards are not austerity,  there are cool!<p>

I think for Napster you miss the point. You confused innovation and interoperability. You can always innovate, that's great! Frontier is a wonderful tool with so many possibilities. You and Userland has given us so good products (not perfect ;-) but really powerful). And if your application is a success, makes it standard... (means openess). It's, IMHO, you're trying with SOAP? To create SOAP, you used XML (standard) on Internet (TCP/IP - Standard), but you innovated.<p>

I think there's a strong difference between a company with a KillerApp that becomes a standard and a KillerApp that becomes a monopoly. I prefer the first one because it gives fresh air to the market and economy. The second one kills the market (that's the example of Word (MS)). When a technology becomes a standard, it offers companies to compete each other but with a usual comon basis. It's more productive and it helps, and calls innovation.<p>

Do you remember the problems of IMS... lack of standards, fight for proprietary protocols. It's easier for the company, but it's not good for the market and FOR PEOPLE.<p>

HTML has had a great success, but it was open, no patent on it. It gives the opportunity to many people to develop applications: Tim Berners Lee (browser on Next, CERN httpd server), Mosaic, Viola, many others and finally Netscape. It helps the web to grow and be so popular.<p>

I don't know if it answered some of your comments.<p>

PS: I hope I was not rude. It's difficult for a non native english to be polite, because we not necessary manipulate all language subtilities.<p>
