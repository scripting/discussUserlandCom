The new website is really impressive, and easy to use. I've been looking at it yesterday night for two hours, and I see how much work and thoughts when into the design. Its clean, informative, with good high levels topics.<p>

Even if I regret the use of the "tree$2.x.x." ending of URLs, I see that you can make sense of the numbers. So its much better than a Vignette URL. You understand very easily that if you loose an end number in the URL (tree$2.1.1 -> tree$2.1) you go back in the hierarchy of the website.<p>

I still have some comments and questions.<p>

<ul>
<li>1. What are the status of the Web and Scripting tutorials written by Matt Neuburg? Is there an update planned (by Brent or Matt) ? I don't see these tutorials on the new website.<p>

<li>2. Are you going to maintains for a while the Frontier 5 website, and if so, are you going to maintains the same URLs ?<p>

<li>3. I still think that you should comment the high level topics on frontier.userland.com. It will be more easier for the beginner to make sense of the topics. Same with the first page of docserver.userland.com. My general feeling is that you have now what appears to be a strong heuristic structure, i.e. the name of the topics are informative, and the way all the lower topics relate to the higher topics look good. But IMO, every pages that is a toc should have all topics commented with a short sentence.<p>

<li>4. Again, I think a good index is missing here.<p>

<li>5. And last but not least, why not having a page &agrave; la "Other tutorials"  (Script Meridian) when you list all the others tutorials that are available outside UserLand. The authors could simply register their work there and voil&agrave; !
</ul><p>

Hey, don't be fooled by this list, the <b>new website is just GREAT</b>!!!<p>

Cheers<p>
