At one point I had OS/2, Linux, and Win95 on the same machine, a Dell 486-SX25. I've never had a problem. Currently I've got it installed on a Toshiba notebook. And I've never had trouble getting it onto Dell machines.<p>

So, just because the installation guide is thick doesn't mean you'll be having lots of problems. If I can do it, anyone can.<p>

Good luck.
