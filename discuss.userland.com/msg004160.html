I double, triple, and quadruple checked the formatting, and it's just like the documentation says. I tried removing the extension (as Robert pointed out). I tried moving the block to various locations on the page. But Netscape keeps coming back with the same response:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>There is a problem with the Site Preview file you submitted. The error is:</I></BLOCKQUOTE><p>

... and then it dosen't tell me what the error is. If I remove the image and textarea elements, everything goes through just fine. Is anyone else experiencing similar problems?
