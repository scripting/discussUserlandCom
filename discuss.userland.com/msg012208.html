I fixed a bunch of nasty bugs and finished documenting all the scripts. You can find all the script docs in the Docs table. I tried something a little different with the script docs. I copied each script to its own outline and added the comments the
re. I did this fo
r a couple of reasons. 1)For those people who don't like to read scripts with comments sprinkled in, the scripts themselves are fairly clean. 2)You can mess around with the scripts and know you got a copy of the original in the docs in case you make a mess of things.<p>

As to the future of this application, my boss showed this app to the guys are at the corporate office. The good news is they loved it and want to roll it out to all the offices. The bad news is that 
they want it re-done in
 Cold Fusion, so they can interface with some stuff they are doing. I tried to get them to keep it in Frontier and use XML to interface with the other stuff, but because of political reasons I have to re-do it in Cold Fusion. Anyways, this means I'm not sure how much time I'll be able to devote to the Frontier version. I had a lot of things I want to add in the next version and I would hate to see all this go to waste. But if I could get some volunteers to help me wit
h this, I might be able to 
keep it going. I haven't worked out any details, but if your interested, email me to let me know. I could use help in all areas - testing, Q & A, coding, documenting, etc.<p>

Thanks and if you have any questions, let me know<p>
