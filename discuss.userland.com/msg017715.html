I wish we could have a discussion group to talk about the movie, with the prerequisite that everyone in the DG had actually seen the movie.<p>

I once got reamed (and remember it well) for revealing the end of some very old movie in a DaveNet piece. A movie from the 40s, like Citizen Kane, The Grapes of Wrath, or something like that.<p>

It had never occurred to me that there were people who hadn't seen the movie.
