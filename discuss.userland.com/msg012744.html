Stop the presses! <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COBT&d=t">Cobalt IPO'd</a> and they're booming! Excellent. We use their product, love it, and think it's one of the most revolutionary products on the market. <i>Go go go!</i><p>

<a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$736">The Wired Channel</a> is back on line. The problem was less exotic than we thought. Just needed to delete a trailing slash on the URL. I like those kinds of solutions.<p>

<a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1388">The Red Herring Channel</a> is back on line. This outage was caused by a UserLand wire-trip. We broke a key verb in Frontier. This only affected testers of 6.1. I'm knocking heads over this one.<p>

Bottom-line: <a href="http://www.salonherringwiredfool.com/">Our showcase</a> for the value of aggregation is back online in its full four-channel glory.<p>

BTW, head-knocking came from The Three Stooges. Moe, Larry and Curly. When Moe got angry (he was always angry) he would take Larry and Curly by the hair and bang their heads together. They'd scream. The kids would laugh. Mothers would be appalled. We turned out OK anyway. ";->" <p>

Here's a <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.homestead.com/stoogepics/files/nose_flick.gif">picture</a> of Moe, getting ready to head-knock Larry and Curly, using their noses as handles.<p>
