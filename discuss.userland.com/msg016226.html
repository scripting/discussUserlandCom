I've been a DaveNet follower since your days at HotWired. I'm not interested in your software, only the things that you say. Scripting News is powerful public platform. In my opinion, you abused that platform by taking a private business matter public and making it personal.<p>

Since 100% uptime is vital to your business, I would suggest using multiple Tier-I providers and BGP4 routing. If you really want to take uptime seriously, use a point-to-point connection from an alternate provider instead of frame relay for the second connection. Or move all of your content servers to co-location facilities with appropriate redundancy, so that connection problems are no longer <i>your</i> problem.
