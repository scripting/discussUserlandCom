Security gave 176 responses, down to 7% relevancy after the first page<p>

security mainResponder didn't get anything relevant.<p>

<p>

But, I've now found it in my archives.<p>

It was in a thread on Questions about mainresponder.respond on the server list.<p>

basically the #security is called in the context of the responder with out any parameters, so you don't need a on [#security] line.<p>

local &#123;
  legalip = &#123;"192.168.0.13","166.84.212.250","192.168.0.30"}};
if not (legalip contains client) &#123;
