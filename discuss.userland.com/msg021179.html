I feel pretty sure that Manila MD5's its passwords nowadays (didn't use to), although as I think about that, is it just in the cookie?  How hard would it be to encrypt in the member's table too, and just compare the two?  It would break the ability to get your password sent to you, but as long as there was an admin interface to set a new password, that wouldn't be disastrous.<p>
