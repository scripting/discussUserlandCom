Bush spoke confidently about foreign policy, and echoed many of my beliefs. The US gets into trouble when we get arrogant. It's better to listen and participate. We're the Microsoft of world politics. <br><br>	Gore was restrained, and I appreciate that, as a voter, and as a person who has trouble keeping quiet myself. From this I got that Gore <i>wants</i> to be President, more than he needs to be heard on every single point.<br><br>	Gore mentioned Quayle, which I found in poor taste, Bush did not mention Clinton, which would have been fair. Gore cornered Bush on Texas' poor record on health insurance for children. <br><br>	Bush also brought the death penalty into the discussion, shocking that an apparently intelligent person thinks killing people is a solution. <br><br>	A lot of discussion about global warming. To me it seems there's nothing we can do about it. Bush pretty much said that. <br><br>	(The Mets <a href="http://www.postnet.com/postnet/stories.nsf/Sports/B8D6026D89286B5486256976000D1ABA?OpenDocument&Headline=METS%206%2C%20CARDS%202%3A%20Hampton%20opens%20with%207%20shutout%20innings%20">won</a>, 6-2; the Yankees <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/12/sports/11YANK-SWING.html">beat</a> the Mariners, 7-1.)<br><br><b>Redesign continues<a name="redesignContinues">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/11#redesignContinues" title="Permanent link to 'Redesign continues' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I'm having a great time working with <a href="http://design.weblogger.com/">Bryan Bell</a> on the redesign of our sites.
