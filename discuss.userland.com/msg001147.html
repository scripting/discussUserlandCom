Further, Frontier must be running on port 80. We will make this a preference soon, but it's not there yet.	Try it out with any page that contains an enclosure, except this page. If you try to RPC the enclosure of this page you'll get an error unpacking because the script overwrites itself. It took me a while to figure out that this is what was happening to me, it causes no harm but it can be confusing.	If you have trouble, please don't send me email, post a message as a response to this message, and also have a look to see what's here before posting. Thanks!<p><p>
