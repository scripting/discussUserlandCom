That's why I'm involved, I think, because I point these things out. ";->"<br><br>	BTW, another big-name company with an investment in Java is joining the SOAP bandwagon. Looks like Python, Perl, Tcl and even Frontier get to play in the same networked sandbox as Java. <i>It's only fair!</i><br><br>	<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/09/12/anEndToTheUberoperatingSystem">9/12/99</a>: "The goal, simply put, is to create a high-level way for machines to call other machines, with the Internet as the wire that connects them."<br><br><b>News bits</b><br><br>	<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16760">Karl Dubost asks</a> if it makes sense to have a Manila/Frontier dinner in Amsterdam during WWW9, May 15-20.<br><br>	<a href="http://ican.editthispage.com/theIndustryStandard2ndAnniversaryParty/">Jeff Cheney has pictures</a> from last night's Industry Standard second anniverary party in San Francisco.<br><br>	A minor correction. On Wednesday, after eating Spicy Noodles, I asked Lance if they matched his expectations. He said "That, and more." I asked "Can I say 'that and <i>so much</i> more'?" He said "Make it up as you go along."<br><br><b>PacBell in the loop</b><br><br>	I spoke this afternoon with Bill Chubb, VP Broadband Services at PacBell. The escalation through Davos worked. (Thanks Lance!) He did something that Conxion has failed to do so far, he apologized. Even though we are not his direct customer. What a pleasure to have a real business person enter the loop who understands the value of the C word. <br><br>	Even though tomorrow is the last day that we depend on PacBell-Conxion for mission-critical services, I'm still helping route Chubb into Conxion's service people so that they can upgrade the service for Conxion's remaining 40 customers who use PacBell to link to the Internet. Ask not what the Internet can do for <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/asknot.gif">you</a>. But I'll tell you what Conxion can do for me. Apologize for the unbelievably rough treatment and offer us a credit for all the money we're wasting doing this conversion and for the lost business during March and April. And then thank us for continuing to help.<br><br>	The analogy I use for what we will do tomorrow. Imagine setting up my six lovely servers at the end of a bowling alley and making me take a shot. Do you think something will break? This transition should have been done slowly, thoughtfully and carefully, with understanding from the ISP. <br><br>	Once again, I gotta say it, every Conxion customer should be aware of what happened here. You could lose your service on 17 days notice, after a month of outages, as we did, and get no apology or credit. <br><br><b>The brain-stem is still breathing</b><br><br>	So tomorrow evening the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$483">subhonkers</a> move to Exodus. In preparation, we're doing a review of all the sites hosted on all the servers. And we've emptied out the very first mainResponder server, Nirvana, so I can have a server to play with after the move. <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$611">All its parts</a> are being distributed. An interesting process, the brain-stem of Manila is still breathing, it's there and working, and of course the higher level stuff wouldn't work if it didn't. <br><br>	<a href="http://www.greatvavavoom.com/"><img src="http://legacystatic1.userland.com/vavaImages/greatVavaVoom/dave@userland.com/greatVavaVoom/6/headshot.gif" height="69" width="61" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" border="0"></a>One of the sites we moved is my Jamaican uncle's <a href="http://www.greatvavavoom.com/">website</a>. It was one of the very first Manila sites, started in August of last year. My uncle has no experience using a computer, so he was a very good early user. He lives on the beach in Jamaica, and since my aunt Dorothy died 11 years ago, he's been looking in vain for a girlfriend or wife to replace her. I always tell my uncle, who I love, there's the bug! You can't replace a human being. Whatever. He's still cool, and if you like bluster, you'll like my uncle. <i>I do!</i><br><br>
