The result is that I've not only learned alot, but also seen up close how really productive his brand of collaboration, serendipity, shake-out, and plain hard work, can be.  The Davos site (and finding Garrett) is a good example of all of those. <p>

Now Dave & Manila are going off to Davos in great form, and bringing the rest of us along with them. I think this is hotter news than the AOL/Time merger! (cause Manila’s a sort of Hotmail for webbies and imho profoundly democratizing.)<p>
