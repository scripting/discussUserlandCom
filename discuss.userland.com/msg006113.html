Using rpmfind it can track down anything! However, installing stuff is a PITA, because it's dangerous to log in as root, but if I'm running GnoRPM as a regular user, I can't actually install any RPMs. Someone on the GNOME list mentioned gsu, but apparently it can't be released until it has been audited, and apparently no one cares enough to do that...<p>
