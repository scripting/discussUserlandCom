Something's always breaking on the old one, now it's the glove compartment. Who ever heard of a glove compartment breaking? Anyway.<br><br>	She wants a new car, and is willing to spend up to $50K, but it must be fuel-efficient. Makes sense, why should leather seats or a nice stereo make a car less efficient? It also has to be automatic transmission and suitable for city driving. <br><br>	So please send me an email if you know of a fuel-efficient luxury car.<br><br>	Postscript: People like the <a href="http://autos.yahoo.com/newcars/details/mazda01millenia/index.html">Mazda Millenia</a>.<br><br><b>The anti-weblog?<a name="theAntiweblog">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/04#theAntiweblog" title="Permanent link to 'The anti-weblog?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	A new idea I'm exploring -- an anti-weblog weblog, one that accumulates information in an organized fashion <i>and</i> does it chronologically. <br><br>	We've gotten so focused on the Web as a temporal medium, now perhaps it makes sense to think of it as a timeless one? <br><br><b>Cross-cultural Unix?<a name="crossculturalUnix">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/04#crossculturalUnix" title="Permanent link to 'Cross-cultural Unix?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://udell.roninhouse.com/"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/udellThumb.gif" height="29" width="30" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right"></a>I had a long phone talk yesterday with <a href="http://udell.roninhouse.com/">Jon Udell</a>. It's been too long since we talked. Jon wants to know why the Unix world doesn't have an integration architecture like Microsoft's <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1036">COM</a>. I've been asking the same question for years. It's not that the technology is so complex, it's not. And some easy first steps are possible, like providing a common interface for applications to integrate scripting. <br><br>	I wrote <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/03/23/perlXML">about this</a> in 1998. "Just as the push to do RPC over HTTP via XML has the potential of getting COM, CORBA and Apple Events to talk to each other, an open cross-platform scripting architecture holds the promise of bringing together cultures from every nook and cranny of the software business, from mainframes to handhelds, from graphics people to the folks who keep the Hubble telescope humming."<br><br>	So, after sleeping on it, I think there's the answer. Unix is not cross-cultural, as a community it's very insular, and each scripting language is its own culture, and is similarly insular. So they solve the same problems over and over. Apparently knowing how to script a Web site in Perl doesn't help you learn how to do the same in Java, or Tcl, or whatever, the wheel has to be reinvented for every common language. <br><br>	But certainly there must be some group of serious Unix developers who recognize the value in breaking down walls, it's a large enough world now that that must be possible?<br><br>	On the <a href="http://mailpages.scripting.com/2000/11/03">current mail page</a>, Jan Gray, formerly of Microsoft, explains that insularity is a feature of programmers, not any specific flavor of programmer. <i>I agree.</i><br><br>	Joel Spolsky, also an ex-softie, has <a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$133">his own view</a> of Microsoft architectures. "Five years after Altavista went live, and two years after Larry Page and Sergei Brin actually invented a radically better search engine, Microsoft is pretending like there's no way to search on the Internet and they're going to solve this problem for us."<br><br>
