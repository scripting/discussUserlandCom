 we've been through some similar problems with the Internic; the most memorable (to date) being moving a domain to a new ISP; it took over three months and countless exchanges.<p>

 maybe it was coincidence but the day before everything got solved i posted a polite-but-edgy complaint on network solutions's feedback page:<p>

 	<a href="http://www.netsol.com/contact/index.html">http://www.netsol.com/contact/index.html</a><p>

 (and at least it does not generate annoying atomaitc replies...)<p>

 now, we're trying to pay for a new domain and their server won't allow me...<p>
