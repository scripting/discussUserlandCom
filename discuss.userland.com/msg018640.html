  The following is possible manually and is a very tedious process... having to update a few pages with the same content... I am just trying to automate this process...<p>

  I am hoping that many more have the same requirement and someone has already programmed/found a solution/plug-in<p>

  I have seen the <a href="http://www.outliners.com/">outliners</a> site and it is close to what I am looking for...<p>

  On my weblog, I would like to be able to create records by entering the following:
<ol>
  <li>Person ( others , myself )
  <li>what is said
  <li>when : date , time
  <li>my keywords
  <li>my comments / notes
</ol><p>

  Now, I would like to generate
<ol>
  <li>all the records for a date -> one page of my weblog
  <li>all the records for one person -> how i have been influenced over time / what has influenced me over time -> for my future reference and for others...
  <li>all the records for one keyword -> my personal knowledge base for this subject
  <li>search across all records which will be my <a href="http://kishore.editthispage.com/2000/07/09">psychic RAM</a>
</ol><p>

  Imagine this feature available on the <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a> website... I would be able to know <p>

  "which articles of Dan Gillmor were interesting to Dave, why he liked them,"<p>

Thanks for listening, Kishore<p>

ps: I think that this feature might be helpful to many more and not just me ! - Please comment<p>

pps: this is probably a subset requirement of my earlier post <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$18400">vision: purposeful online community for all human beings...
