It's been discussed here in various threads. There's only one feature I am looking for. But first, I refer you to the people who are pushing HTML to its limits on EditThisPage.Com, who are my teachers on this subject. <p>

UserLand does not push the browser to their limit. All our sites are usable on 4.x level browsers, and will continue to be, for the forseeable future. (But a caveat, things are changing, the forseeable future may only be a matter of months.)<p>

The one feature I am looking for is the ability to embed the MSIE HTML renderer in my app. That's it. I don't need it until mid-late of 2000. Such a capability exists on Windows, but not on the Mac. Further, at a technical level, it probably exists, because Outlook Express shares this code with MSIE on the Mac.
