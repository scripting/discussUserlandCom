Just got off the phone and they don't offer what I'm after. But I think I didn't make myself clear in the original message as to what that is.<p>

I can create the application (which is what WebMethods does supply), but I don't have the data source. I want access to Stock Quote DATA for my Company (preferably) in XML format. I will then take the data and transform it into a portion of our Internet/Intranet webpages.<p>

I was thinking that this type of data would be a perfect candidate for XMLizing (new verb). We would then subscribe to a particular data stream (for our company, maybe the competitors, etc.) and reformat it for our own uses.<p>

Any further information would be appreciated. Otherwise, I will continue to place the "bug" in the ear of companies which provide Stock Quote information on their own websites!<p>

BTW, It is silly to continue this conversation under the wrong topic. How do you start a new thread/topic? Why isn't there a link on the top which allows me to do that?<p>
