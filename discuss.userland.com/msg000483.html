It seems to me that they are shooting themselves in the foot by doing this, but I understand their motivation.  They also may have been trying to make a point vis a vis the anit-trust case:  We even own competing software but we are forced to use IE in order to get desktop space.  <p>

Perhaps we are all too caught up in browser market share, but as a Web developer, you can't help but be ensnared by it.  If standards were properly implemented across the great divide, then it would matter that much less to me.
