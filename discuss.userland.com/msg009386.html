Instead of linking to the article, put a link on the page that, if clicked, causes a CGI on your site to send form letter email to the person that is supposed to approve the linking. The email would say:<p>

"I would like to read your that-and-that page, but site this-or-that which wants to link to your page didn't get permission from you yet. Please send them permission quickly so they can link and so I can read your valuable content. Thanks!".<p>

I'm sure that after a few times they'll get the idea. It'd be great if for example /. would engage in this legal email-bombing attack.<p>

OK, so this is a joke and is probably not legal, but I had to vent :).
