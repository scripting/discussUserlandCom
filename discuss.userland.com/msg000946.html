Yes. For instance, if you have a page that changes often, you can send it to the search engine as often as it changes.<p>

There is one thing to beware of: the search engine does cache results. So if you do a search for "Tomalak," then submit a new page with the word "Tomalak," then search for "Tomalak" again, the new page won't show up until the cache is cleared. (Which it is, several times a day.)
