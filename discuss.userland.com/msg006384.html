Linux evolved into Unix compatibility.  BSD evolved from the original Unix codebase.  <p>

Perhaps the most important part...<p>

Linux is GPL(GNU General Public License) which means it will always be free.  If you ever want to release your code(by selling or posting to a ftp or website), you must make the code availible too.  <p>

BSD is under the BSD license.  This means that you have to put a copyright notice in your program, and then you can do whatever you want with it.  Even sell it.  NeXTStep is BSD code on a Mach microkernel(as is Darwin).  The BSD license doesn't make any restriction on distribution like the GPL does.  I could take the OpenBSD codebase right now and use it in my Commercial OS.  <p>

This difference in License is why often time things like Firewalls, etc are in BSD.  Because the company can keep their code secret, they often choose BSD.  <p>

Other the license issues, most other differences are really just splitting hairs.  Most of the Unix programs you can find for Linux, will also compile and run on BSD(Perl, Apache, X-Win, GNOME, GIMP, Netscape, etc etc)
