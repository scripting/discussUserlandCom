you also potentially taking away an ad impressions on their own
headline listing page.  Taking away ad impressions means reducing ad revenue.  Keep in mind, every 1000 ad impressions is worth upward of $0.02.<p>


One thing that you'll commonly find with syndication services is that
they do not run their own headline site.  This is so that there is 
no competition between the syndicator and the publisher.  Publishers are having a tough enough time being profitable, so we 
must be careful with things like "syndicating" someone else's content.  We could be syndicating them right our of business.<p>

If on the other hand, sites sign up to syndicate their content to
internet alchemy who is just a repository of syndications, then 
I see less of an issue, since this is an "opt-in" type of service.<p>

One thing that is slightly worrisonme is this snippet from the Internet Alchemy FAQ.<p>

>> Isn't There a Copyright Issue?<p>

>> Not really. <p>

Shouldn't this be a yes or no response? <p>

Comments?<p>
