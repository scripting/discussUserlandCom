I only discovered Frontier about three weeks ago as a solution to a project I am working.  The lack of formal documentation has been one of the items that has made Frontier a hard sell internally.  The fact that there was an O'Reilly book did help.<p>

The power and elegance of Frontier is a strong selling point but communicating this to both technical and non-technical decision makers can be helped by updating the documentation and tutorials.  I hope there is a 2nd Edition of the Matt's book that ships with every copy of Frontier.<p>

Congratulations again,<p>
