Well, are you concerned about malicious administrators, or about somebody using Back Orifice to break into your server and steal the entire password database?<p>

If you're concerned about the former, there's no good solution. If you're concerned about the later, there's a really cool trick for frustrating the attackers.<p>

The basic alogrithm is simple:<p>

<ul>
<li>Encrypt all the passwords in your database using a one-way encryption function.</li>
<li>When the user types in a password, encrypt it and compare it against the database.</li>
</ul><p>

Now, if somebody steals your database, they're forced to encrypt the entire dictionary one word at a time and look for matches. You can make their life <i>really</i> difficult in several other ways (do a web search for "password salt" to get an idea).<p>

Of course, if you're not worried about database theft, then these techniques are useless.<p>

Cheers,<br>
