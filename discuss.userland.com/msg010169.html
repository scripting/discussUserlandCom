The phone rings. "Hi Dave, this is Mark Mell, the CEO of Mell Machines, and we have a new PC in the works, it's wonderful, and I was wondering if you'd like to try it out? We'll bring it in a limo. We'll take it back anytime you get tired of it, and hopefully replace it with something you like even better. Will you tell us what that might be? Oh and if you like it, is it OK if we tell other people that you use our product?"</i><p>
