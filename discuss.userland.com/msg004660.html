Some ideas: buttons in the UI that show all pages linked to the current page via search engine, translation, <a href=http://www.bookmarklets.com/>bookmarklets</a>, and other demand based, context-sensitive functions.  Ones that involve a choice of server, but not a violation of privacy.<p>

Browsers have done <b>nothing</b> in the UI sector for the past four years - look at Netscape 1.0 and find how much of the UI has improved. All that changes is how the slick little buttons change when you put your mouse over them.<p>

And why can't I use spellcheck or thesaurus in text area?<p>

I guess that kind of turned into a rant - sorry 'bout that.<p>
