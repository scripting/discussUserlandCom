I've been assuming it's the case that Amazon wanted Alexa for the vast store of information.  I believe that this is used only in the aggregate, however, and that user information is stripped -- sure, Amazon could change this, but note that the Alexa privacy policy says:<p>

<I>We also use our data, in aggregate, to create reports and summaries for internal use and external sale. We do not include our users' email addresses in these reports.</I>

I have no reason to doubt this, although I am curious as to what TRUSTe does to validate the privacy policies it certifies.  Is it reasonable to think that TRUSTe isn't trustworthy?  I have no idea. :)<p>

Note that the click trails are hugely valuable even without usernames attached; it is to Amazon's benefit to know, say, what paths people take through Barnes and Noble's Web site.  It doesn't matter so much who the people are; it's like getting copies of their Webserver logs.  Wow.  So Amazon has a motive to buy Alexa even without assuming that there's lying going on.<p>

And as Dave says -- I'm not really sure where to be tense about these issues.  I mean, it's not as if they're following me, but it's sure true that they care about the demographics.  I personally wouldn't be inclined to give Alexa my zip code.  It's this weird situation where Alexa intrudes just a little bit on each person's privacy but the total intrusion is... large?<p>

Data warehousing of this nature raises immense privacy issues that, to my knowledge, nobody has addressed yet.  David Brin wrote an interesting book called <CITE>The Transparent Society</CITE> that comes at this issue from the other side, claiming that privacy is an obsolete concept.  I disagreed but it was useful for focussing my thoughts; I always like reading good arguments on the other side of any such matters.<p>

(Edit This Page is an amazingly useful service, Dave.  I love being able to refine and reconsider my thoughts.  Thanks!)
