Is this still true?  I am wondering since I am thinking of changing a data structure to be more like discuss.root.  I used to have all my data in a calendar structure and the renderer walked that to build the site.  But it makes allowing editing of the entries a bear.  So there can there be 40 - 50 thousand subtables in a table.  Is this memory dependant or something to work around with rolling tables.  How is the DG going to cope with this?
