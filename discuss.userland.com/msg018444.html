You posted a challenge on Scripting News to write code that processed the new ScriptingNews XML.  In that challenge you said unambiguously that you would post links to anyone who wrote code to process the file.<p><p>

I spent Sunday putting it together, and did it by building on Brian Kelly's solution.  His stuff was a servlet.  Mine was peer networking, using WorldOS (the package I work on).  When I mailed you the solution at <a href="http://www.worldos.org/worldos/FindCurrentOutline.php3">http://www.worldos.org/worldos/FindCurrentOutline.php3</a>, you responded:<p><p>

"But it's not the right XML.  EEK!  Maybe technology for technologies sake is not such a good idea?"  <p><p>

and that was it.  No link.  No response to my friendly followup.  I met the challenge fair and square, and you failed to live up to your word.<p><p>

Just thought this post should be in public, on your site, as documentary evidence of a breach of faith.  You're welcome.  <p> <p>

Sincerely,<br>
Lucas Gonze
