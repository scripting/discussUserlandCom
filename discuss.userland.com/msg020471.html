Gitlin, a former leader of SDS, observed that the loudest, scruffiest, and most radical anti-Vietnam-War protestors got the most attention from the media.  The protesters confused time on TV screens with influence on the general public, and this led to a positive-feedback cycle -- the protests' rhetoric and style kept getting more radical, and most Americans were alienated from the movement.  Thus, when a <i>moderate</i> movement against the Vietnam War emerged, it was almost completely disconnected from the radicals.

<li>why you, through your rhetoric of urgency, may end up undermining your own cause
