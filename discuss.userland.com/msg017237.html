As you noted the other day, the referrer solution doesn't work for browsers that send no referrer, or people who don't have referrer sending enabled.<p>

So, while Manila has a fix, the larger problem remains, particularly on web sites where trusted and untrusted users both have write permissions, and a mix of GET/POST administrative effects.<p>

The future needs a better web security model than the one we've got at the moment. Browsers need to have a feature where they'll only send session information when referred to from the same "zone" (however you end up defining a zone...), in the same way that encoding session info in the URL currently works as a solution to this issue.<p>

I certainly don't have all the answers, but I hope people who create the browser technology can work together on this one.
