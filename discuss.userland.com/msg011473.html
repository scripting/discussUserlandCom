1. If the NT network I'm logged into via AppleShare has a hiccup while Frontier is trying to mount a volume, Frontier can hang. I can't be more specific than 'hiccup' because IT won't look into it for me, but I know it does not involve a server crash.<p>

2. If I'm serving with Frontier and disconnect from my ISP, Frontier will not respond until the connection is restored. I can't quit or shutdown under this circumstance unless I kill Frontier or reconnect.<p>
