Meanwhile, as a lefty, I find the hyperbole on the FreeRepublic.com site quite refreshing:
<blockquote>
No matter what the eventual outcome of this election, one thing has been decided. That would be the Clinton Legacy. William Jefferson Clinton and the democRATS have managed to destroy the election process of a once free Constitutional Republic. The way we choose our leaders, and the very direction of our government itself has surely been stained and befouled as was a certain blue dress. WELCOME TO THE UNITED SOCIALIST STATES OF AMERICA! 
</blockquote>
If all the Naderites had been that convinced that Clinton was a socialist, the fat lady would have sung by now.
