<p>
I never said it was particular to Microsoft.  On the contrary, I think that the monoculture idea is a meme that is becoming more popular and thinking people like to use it to make points.  I also am unhappy about people who push "the one true way", as described in Popper's Open Society.  But I think that to say that "variety is (always) useful" or "monocultures (always) output less" is an indefensible position.  The problem is, most anyone I have seen invoking the phrase monoculture is hoping to slide in the assumptions unchallenged that:
<p>
<i>When [there exists a] monoculture, less is created and we are deprived of useful variety.</i>
<p>
Monoculture is nearly always equated with "bad".  Karl Popper would disapprove; saying that monoculture is always bad is a shortcut in thinking, as I tried to demonstrate in my previous post.  Variety is not always useful, and more is not always created by variety.  And your argument that a large creative pattern dies when a company folds seems to hinge on the assumption that I swallow the fallacy that monoculture==bad.
