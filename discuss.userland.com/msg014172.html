I can mount UNIX volumes as if they were hfs via appletalk over tcp/ip right now (using netatalk), and have been able to for a few years now. And I'm pretty sure thats what you are doing with iDisk. The iDisk volume is almost certainly living on a UNIX filesystem, whether its hfs or ufs I don't know.<p>

Don't get me wrong I think OS X looks awesome, and I want it yesterday :-) As for the iTools - my frustration at people trying to make the web anything less than a universal access system doesn't lessen because the vendor of my platform starts to play tit for tat. The fact is they could easily make iDisks for Windows users if they wanted to. It's called Samba. In fact, then, you as a mac user would still be able to get at your iDisk even if you were traveling and staying with PC-using friends.
