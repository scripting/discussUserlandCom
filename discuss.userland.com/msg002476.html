There are about 10 of them.<p>

The specs can be found <a href="http://www.stonecottage.com/josh/java/jini/doc/specs/jcp.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.stonecottage.com/josh/java/jini/doc/specs/jxp.html">here</a>. <p>

I've also put an excerpt of a spec <a href="http://www.stonecottage.com/josh/java/jini.html">here.</a>  It shows what the enviromental assumptions are for someone using Jini.<p>

I'm going to move my way through the specs and post my thoughts and observations.  Who knows if it can be used with Frontier but it should be interesting investigating.<p>
