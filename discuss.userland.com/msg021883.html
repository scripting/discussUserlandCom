"Send a salami to your boy in the Army."<br><br><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/477689.asp">MSNBC</a>: "Dozens of Manhattan-based dot-com companies — most of them in the downtown area known colloquially as 'Silicon Alley' — have closed their doors or seriously scaled down their operations in recent months."<br><br>Looks like the dot-commers are screwing up NY too. <a href="http://articles.citysearch.com/New_York/restaurants/000302/">Ratner's might not</a> even be open.<br><br>Clay Shirky: ''Ratners! You can't have really grown up here if you have trouble deciding between Ratner's and Katz's. They should name a disease after you if you drag a bunch of greasy-food neophytes to Ratner's. I will be at Katz's at 8 on Wednesday. Hope to see you there.

"Google has finally indexed this site and sends us about 50 visitors a day. I really want to know how people feel when they end up in a place where everyone has fun with their search terms."<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/23/sports/23GAME.html">NY Times</a>: "The Mets are in serious trouble. The Mets must win four of the next five games against the Yankees, who have won six of their last seven games." It's true that the Mets are in serious trouble. But the Mets do their best work when they're in serious trouble.<br><br>Clemens should have been ejected from the game for throwing the shattered bat at Piazza. Here's why. Clemens' bean-ball, bat throwing tactics <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20001023/sp/bbo_jim_litke_3.html">work</a>. "Before that encounter in July, he practically owned Clemens. Piazza was 7-for-12 lifetime against him, with three homers and a double. Sunday night, Piazza went 0-for-3." <br><br>I would love to see Clemens step up to the plate himself. Unfortunately the American League has the designated hitter rule, which means the pitcher almost never bats. If the Yankees weren't apologists for Clemens, if they had <i>philosophy,</i> they'd have saved him for Shea, a National League stadium.<br><br>
