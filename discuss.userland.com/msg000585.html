Though he didn't invent freedom and democracy, it was his refined vision and eloquence that inspired and continues to inspire democratic movements around the globe.<p>

I can imagine a history without Jefferson. America wouldn't be America. France might be ruled by a king. South Africa might have remained the land of apartheid, with no hope of change. And so on. It would be a much darker world without the light of his vision of democracy and freedom.
