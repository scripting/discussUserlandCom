scriptable on unix.  I discovered this after examining the Netscape.ad file that comes with the distribution.<p>

The interesting thing is the command "xfeDoCommand()".  With this command, you can do "netscape -remote xfeDoCommand(print)" to print the current document.  Of course, in looking through Netscape.ad, it looks like their are hundreds of other interesting commands.  For example:<p>

netscape -remote 'fishcam()'
