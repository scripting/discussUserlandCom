BTW, the real killer with Java is not runtime speed (which is fine for  most things requiring user interaction), it is memory usage.  The  reason for this is that the class libraries aren't shared between  processes like DLLs are for traditional compiled/native code apps.  One way to avoid this is to use something like <a href="http://www.javagroup.org/echidna/">echidna</a> to run all your java apps in the one JVM.
