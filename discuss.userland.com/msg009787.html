I mean there is no analizes of what is Marijuana. If it's dangerous or not, and so on. Carl Sagan was a Marijuana smoker, fine  and what does-it prove ? <p>

I'm sure Dave Winner is a .... something smoker, lover, eater... but he is Dave Winner, a man with good and bad ideas, but at least HIS OWN IDEAS...<p>

	Like Carl Sagan.
