And the Advanced search is slower than the basic search. A basic search for a less common word -- like AppleScript -- will return quickly.<p>

The Search Engine help page -- <a href="http://search.userland.com/help">http://search.userland.com/help</a> -- talks about this. But I suspect the search engine can still be made faster. If nothing else, it could ignore words that are way too common to be meaningful (in this context).<p>

The search engine does cache basic searches (but not advanced searches), so additional screens are at least quick to load, and any very commonly-run searches should be fastest.
