Pool what we learn. I gather that's some of what you're doing? I got another call from a big portal company yesterday and they asked me some questions about how other people like me would feel about what they were planning on doing. I said I could only tell them what I thought which was:<p>

1. It stinks.<p>

2. But go ahead and do it if you want, because you'll get away with it.<p>

The purpose of pooling our thinking in some way is to make sure we don't have to say #2 and #1 is sufficient to keep them from doing it.
