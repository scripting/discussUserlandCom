That's going to be a FAQ. Yes, it's a problem. Basically if you want the power of guest databases, it's tedious to do that. I'm sure we'll write some scripts that make that easy, but those scripts don't exist yet.<p>

To help bootstrap development of these kinds of utilities, we've included a handy <a href="http://pointers.userland.com/mainResponderCrawler">script</a> that crawls thru your domains structure and visits every node in every object database.
