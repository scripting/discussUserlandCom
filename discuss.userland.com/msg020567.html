He's in the Latin American tradition of charismatic, populist strongmen, generally with military backgrounds (like Chavez). <p>

The economy is going to hell in a handbasket at the moment, thanks to declining investment and capital flight. But Chavez seems to remain hugely popular. An interesting left-wing journalist, Richard Gott, has written a book on Chavez, <i>In the Shadow of the Liberator</i>, which argues he is the most significant Latin American leader since Castro. <p>

Gott may be a bit starry-eyed, but Chavez is certainly a fascinating phenomenon. You can read <a href="http://www.worldlink.co.uk/stories/storyReader$302">my review of the Gott book</a>.
