I am very excited about Manila! <p>

I've been following Frontier since the Clay Basket days and have built a few simple Frontier solutions over the years.<p>

What interests me most about Manila is how it "generates" HTML (or whatever) using scripts and XML. Also, I've been waiting a long time for a good example of a Web-centric UI.<p>

I really admire some of the ingeniously simple features like the glossary. As a Mac guy, I really dig the BBEdit menu-sharing. I found UserTalk to be a real solid scripting language and DocServer was very helpful in learning the language. <p>

I'm really looking forward to seeing how the product has evolved since I last used it in 98.<p>

The only real mystery for me is how I can obtain an evaluation version of 6.1 without getting one of my student buddies to buy it for me. <p>

I am pretty certain that I can put it to work somehow on our site but it would be difficult to justify the purchase without some kind of evaluation.<p>

Lastly, I am really looking forward to participating in the Frontier community as soon as possible.<p>

PS: outlines rock!<p>
