Come on folks! Want to talk about thwarting the justice system? Take a look at the people who started this; Realistically speaking they were probably doing what they did for self serving reasons, especially the republican party.<p>

Sure, he probably should not have lied. Sure, it would have saved us all time and money had he just done the wise and honorable thing and admitted to what he had done. But he didn't and a lot of people in his position would have done the same thing he did.<p>

But does it make THAT much of a difference in the way he handles the country? I'm not sure it does. I think there is a fundamental difference between deeply personal sexual issues and national and international issues. The argument "he lied to us here, where else is he lying to us?" seems built on unsturdy ground.<p>

He's not the only one responsible for thwarting the smooth operation of our judicial system. It's a shame that the various people responsible for this fiasco aren't at least criticized for wasting our time.
