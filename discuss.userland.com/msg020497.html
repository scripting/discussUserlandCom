Solving problems with software is easy (sort-of). The really hard part is the making the problems relevant and the solutions impactful. Software's power extends way beyond the initial act of writing the code, and unleashing that power is the most exiting challenge of all.</i><p>

Wow.  Cool.<p>

What HE said.<p>

That goes right along with my feeling that keeping software easy is what is hard.<p>

This also plays right into the observation that while Linux is technically impressive (in some ways), they haven't really solved the hard problems (like making it easy to configure).<p>
