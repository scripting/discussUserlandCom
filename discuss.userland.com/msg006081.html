I can press the Back button on my browser a bunch of times or edit my browser URL back to discuss.userland.com, but these actions interfere with my flow. Would it be worth it to add a "Discussion Home Page" link to the menu of links at the top of discussion pages?</i><p>

You can always get back to the home page by clicking on the big Discuss link to the left of the title of the page.<p>

If this doesn't do what you want, please explain. If the problem is that it wasn't obvious, we can fix the problem by adding a Home link to the navbar at the top.<p>

I need to know which is the problem. Is the link you need missing, or was it obscure and you didn't find it?
