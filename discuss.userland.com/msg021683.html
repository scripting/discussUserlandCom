It doesn't look to me like they are claiming HTML as a trademark, but list it as generic usage (no TM symbol there).  However, they do appear to have trademarked CSS and XHTML.  (Going back to the not a trademark lawyer disclaimer) Perhaps HTTP and HTML were in common usage so it was too late?<p>

I don't know their motivation for trademarking these terms.  Could have been as simple as they didn't want them hijacked and used for something else not representative of their original purpose.  That would entirely make sense, IMO.
