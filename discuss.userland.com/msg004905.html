I have a table #employees which is gaining new entries every time I sign on with a different identity. I have a web subtable with #members = employees (is this better to be in #prefs or a peer of default?). In members.root I changed opentopublic to false (because some of the examples had it that way). It seems odd, but every time I save the table, then quit and start up Frontier6, opentopublic has been changed back to true. Perhaps I didn't save with members.root being the frontmost table. That's a bit confusing that it doesn't ask you if you want to save when there are unchanged items. Anyway, when I logon, and am on the welcome page, then click to go to my custom page, it takes me back to the logon. Something is not right, but I don't know where else to look. I've examined MailTotheFuture and the htmlInterfaces and that is interesting but my membership loop's not quite there. <p>

Thanks for all the help, you guys have been great.
