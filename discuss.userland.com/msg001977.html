I have been following this situation for some time.  In the beginning of the whole Apple next thing, it was just as you say, the big push was to the Next API.  Developers balked, Adobe and Macromedia threatened to pull support for the Apple platform.  Apple listened, that is why they developed Carbon, when the new OS comes, developers will have a choice of API's Carbon and NextStep.<p>
