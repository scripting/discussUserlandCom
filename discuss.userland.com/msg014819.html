<a href="http://superhonker.userland.com/slideshows/websitesThatRockTheWorld/slide01.html">Outline</a> of my presentation for Thursday.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14823">Mike Jamieson</a> has a Flash Generator page that's authored using Manila. Wow. I wish I had time to savor this, I know it would taste very sweet. Thanks Mike!<p>

6:55AM Pacific. I am able to get thru to the DavosNewbies site.<p>

Here's a <a href="http://www.davosnewbies.com/stories/storyReader$347">draft</a> of the press release we'll run late tonight Pacific, early morning in Europe. You see it first, a Scripting News exclusive! (Until someone else points to it. And please do, of course. We're very proud of our participation in this site.)<p>

7:25AM Pacific. Lance is getting through too.<p>

Last night's remap of "DavosNewbies" still hasn't made it thru my DNS. Oy! This was a good idea if it happened quickly. Here's a <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/run/dave@userland.com/doYouSeeDavosnewbies">quick survey</a>. Your help is appreciated. Thanks.<p>

Just got a note from Lance. He can't get thru to the site either and it's driving him crazy. (Me too!) And to make matters worse, <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/">Dan Gillmor</a> is already in Davos, and is skiing today! I'm so jealous. I think I'm going to get a job working for the SJ Merc.<p>

I raised the question of doing a live presentation in Europe after Davos and before heading to Boston. Lots of great invites. Thanks! However, with all the speaking and traveling I wanted a few days just for me in Europe, so I decided *not* to do a live session in Europe this trip. I'm coming back in May for WWW9 in Amsterdam, that gives us more time to plan and I'll be more relaxed for sure. <p>

<a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.robotwisdom.com/">Robot Wisdom</a> is doing something really excellent. He's got a webcam of the hour front and center on his home page. Today's trip is to Montreal. What a great idea. <i>Hat's off to JB.</i><p>

<a href="http://ondecidingbetter.editthispage.com/">James Vornov</a>: "People like me just keep buying stocks. This year I've moved my money around a great deal because of volatility. But my money is joining that of many others chasing the best valuations in the market. My money is unlikely to go out of the market." <p>

Excellent. <i>Mac only.</i><p>

MSNBC: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/m/d2k/ia.asp">Gore/Bush Win in Iowa</a>. Slick, stiff and dishonest still sell. Money money money. Why did you vote for Bush? "We thought he could win." <i>Oy!</i>
