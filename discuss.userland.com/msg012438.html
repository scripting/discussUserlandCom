<I>Fully</I> repurposes?  Seems to me fully repurposing would involve grabbing the article, reformatting and re-presenting, not sending them to the original site as SHWF does.  The only lost traffic is the home page of those sites, for the most part.  The gain is likely to be greater, as people are more likely to visit the site period when they don't have to browse all four themselves to find new articles.<p>

Or did you mean something else that I'm not seeing by fully re-purposing?
