I wish I could - sorta like syndication but for "services" - be able to specify in my ETP template a location to allow for this. Meaning "if you subscribe to weblogs.com, and you come to my site, you will see your 'favorites' panel there too."<p>

I could imagine a flurry of cross-promotional efforts if this capability were added.  It's like syndication, but not "newsy"
