I meant that your regular readers are the converted. We know that Frontier is a good thing and that everyone else needs to figure out what it does. I guess that its operation is so obvious that it is too subtle for some folks. <i>When I've shown people how easy it is to create content using Manila, some of them actually don't understand what they have done</i>.<p>

When you show a teacher that can't attach a JPG to an email without an explicit list of instructions, and then walk that same person through posting the current day's assignment on a Manila site and having it available to their students, they sometimes don't "get" that they have published to the web. It's hard to believe, but it's true! <p>

But I get your point of view too. If you can keep the focus on Manila as a tool for creating content for websites through a regular browser, then that's great. I guess that my own experience with some users makes me wary of where the conversation can go with regards to scripting.<p>

We all have to remember that there is a vast number of people out there that have acess to the Internet and email and that have something to say. <i>It's like having a Porsche in the driveway and not being able to drive a standard - lotsa potential for exciting things, if only you knew how to use it</i>.<p>
