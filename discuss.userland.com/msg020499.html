That's what a charity is. What's more, a 501(c)(3) may not compete directly with private enterprise except for the purpose of fund-raising, and the money raised in this way is considered "unrelated business income" and is taxed. If it amounts to more than 50% of the organization's income, it can't remain a 501(c)(3) non-profit.</i><p>

I don't understand how this can be the case.  501(c)(3)-qualified organizations certainly do compete with private enterprises all the time.  Public radio and television compete with private broadcasters; public universities compete with private universities.  Maybe I'm not understanding the claim here, but as I read it, if you're right, there are a lot more organizations than the FSF that should lose their 501(c)(3) status.<p>
