This is the discipline of listening, flipped around.<p>

How do you make an idea juicy enough so that people actually listen to it? <p>

And if you manage to convince people, probably through persistence, how do you ensure that they remember where the idea came from?<p>

Many creative people do it so they get the recognition, presumably recognition they didn't get when they were young, and you get frustrated creative people when the recognition doesn't come, even if the idea gains traction.<p>

Further, there's an extra requirement for recognition when the originator of the idea is generous and doesn't patent it. <p>

Lots of thoughts on this issue. I'd like to have something like the USPTO database for ideas of value that are shared publicly without patents. How would we set something like that up? A board of peers, people who are creative, logging ideas that tickle their imaginations and seem to have large potential and be fairly unique? A no flame policy so that there's no risk for bringing and idea to the pool of free ideas?
