[get people using micropayment schemes]</i><p>I was going to mention Jeff Kandt's <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$1469">voluntary payment ideas</a> over at Hack the Planet, then I saw in the thread that you're all over it...maybe all that's missing is a compelling application that requires micropayments. A convenient system for donating to artists might do it. Voluntary payments wouldn't bring too bad of a chicken and egg problem, since it's not something the artist would be relying on exclusively.
