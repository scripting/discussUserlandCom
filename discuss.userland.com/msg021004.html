What about having access to our data? When I use a web app, I want to be able to download my data. How many services offer this? I lost my calendar on Yahoo a month ago. Gone, the bits forever missing. Is this a serious user-level issue? You bet it is."<p>

I ditto the sentiment 100%.  While i've never experienced such sloppy data handing as this at quality services such as Yahoo and eGroups, i have lost it enough times in other "Free" WebApps that i'm always hesitant to use them.  Only if they offer unique functionality that i can't get at reasonable cost in a database that in control will i even think of it now -- not if the data is at all important.<p>

This reminds me of a question i've been meaning to ask:  before i can build a site at weblogs or ETP dotcom that attracts a community of any significance, i'll need more access to the user database than i've thus far been able to gain.  Am i missing something obvious, or is it an un(der)documented feature, or what?  I always figured that, to enjoy such a great ad-free service, this was the catch;  if i wanted user database access, i'd have to buy a Frontier server.  But DW's comments above make me think that may be that's not it;  maybe in fact it's just my own cluelessness.<p>

If anyone would kindly advise, i should be most grateful.  |/|/
