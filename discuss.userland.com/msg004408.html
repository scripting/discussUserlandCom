But I want to arrange the tasks themselves in a hierarchy (with a nice GUI for re-arranging it), which throws you back into outline mode. <p>

The combination of the 2 modes is very rare, which is why I grooved on InfoDepot. You could query on any column, show items on a calendar, etc. while still keeping the hierarchy as the primary view.
