It's apparently an HTTP daemon that runs in the NS6 client.<p>

From the page:<p>

<i>I've discovered a pair of new capbilities in Java, one residing in the Java core and the other in Netscape's Java distribution. The first (exploited in BOServerSocket and BOSocket) allows Java to open a server which can be accessed by arbitrary clients. The second (BOURLConnection and BOURLInputStream) allows Java to access arbitrary URLs, including local files. <p>

As a demonstration, I've written Brown Orifice HTTPD for Netscape Communicator. BOHTTPD is a browser-resident web server and file-sharing tool that demonstrates these two problems in Netscape Communicator. BOHTTPD will serve files from a directory of your choice, and will also act as an HTTP/FTP proxy server. <p>

WARNING: Brown Orifice is a SECURITY HOLE, not a toy. Files in the directory you specify are likely to be downloaded by other people. You must completely exit Netscape in order to turn it off.</i><p>

Also:<p>

<i>WHOA! I just saw a Windows 2000 system that was still running BOHTTPD even after Netscape had been apparently terminated. Even the "Task Manager" showed no trace.</i>
