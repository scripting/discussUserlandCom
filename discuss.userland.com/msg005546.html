As I read my copy of W. Richard Stevens' TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume I (pp 190-191):<p>

* There are currently 13 root name servers, serving up theoretically identical information (the IP addresses of the root servers can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.rs.internic.net/netinfo/root-servers.txt">ftp://ftp.rs.internic.net/netinfo/root-servers.txt</a>).  Every primary domain name sever for a second-level domain must be configured with these IP addresses, since you can't do a DNS on the root name servers, any more than you can call directory assistance for the number for directory assistance without already knowing the number for directory assistance.<p>

* Each root name server knows all first and second level domain names.  I'm not sure if this applies to second-level domains in country top-level domains (e.g. foobar.us or baz.uk), but it sounds like it does.<p>

* It's not clear to me from my limited reading if the domain name servers are to be queried round-robin, or if a primary name server should fine the one with the lowest latency and stick with it.
