All I do is grab digital photos and save them to my hard drive.<p>

When I need to use one on my website, I grab it into Frontier after compressing it and do the usual things. I don't have time to do fancy Photoshop stuff like other sites (because I focus on content after all...:-)<p>

Simple needs = simple software.<p>

I am writing a couple of chapters for a book and used Word because everyone else on the project did too. I got very frustrated very fast at how hard it was to link source code that was changing into the document. Stuff that Word was NEVER designed for.<p>

Then I submitted a chapter that I outlined in Frontier and had it render the txt to HTML. Then I threw it at ishtar12 (HTML-RTF) and everyone was happy they could read it in Word.....and I was happy that my tool of choice (Frontier) let me focus on content, not formatting or updating new code sections.<p>

Cheers, Ralph Hempel
