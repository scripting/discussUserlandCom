OSses have an ugly face. A real web desktop shouldn't carry that ugly face legacy from our current desktop methaphor. I think that what bothers me most on the desktops right now are those windows with bars and buttons taking up screen space.</I><p>

<B>My wishes for the perfect Web Desktop</B>
<UL>
<LI>The web desktop should be first of all clean. No big buttons, no big scroll bars, no title bar. Just empty screen space for the web page to  fill.<p>

<LI>You need a way to be on more than one page at once, choose on the fly if you want to open the next link on the same page or on a new page.<p>

<LI>Then of course you need a way to flip thru all the opened pages and close them at will. Some little tabs like the ones on Excel to flip thru spreadsheets should do.<p>

<LI>Finally the apps, the most basic ones and all the configuration options could be done very simply like simple forms with some cgi backend running local and talking http and xml-rpc to the entire web, grabbing all the content that matches a few patterns that I'd setup, taking care of all my mail sorting it thru my folders and storing and organizing every message that ever entered the mail box (deleting the spam of course). The most complex apps could even run like applets or even a local app, as long as I have some good place to write, good place to make spreadsheets and so on.<p>

<LI>And to be really really perfect having a persistent connection to the web and leting me (if I choose to) access the desktop (at least the basic information like my mail and accessing any data)from any browser on the web.
</UL><p>

<P>Funny thing is that we already have all the tools, all the technology to do this desktop. I don't care what OS or Hardware that would run, I wouldn't even want to know which OS was, as long as it worked and never, ever showed it's ugly face at me.</p>
