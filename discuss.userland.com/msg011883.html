Its really all perspective.  IMHO, Some people prefer to view everything as objects which have methods, and others view 
everything as data.<p>

DAV makes data the first class citizen and provides a structured
way to manipulate that, using HTTP as its "RPC" layer, much the same
way that ADO makes you look at everything as a rowset..
DAV makes access to data interoperable.  While it cant
always communicate the semantics, it does uniformly represent
everything in a consistent model.<p>

XML-RPC makes the object a first class citizen, but doesnt
specify the structured data access that DAV does.  One could
easily implement DAV(like) methods in XML-RPC.<p>

We can argue about how many layers is good or bad, but it
seems to me that XML-RPC and WEBDAV can live together happily.<p>

From my perspective, I would use DAV to manipulate data ojects
themselves, and use XML-RPC to invoke a method on that same resource.<p>

Just my 0.02
