" (San Francisco-AP) -- A federal appeals court panel has granted
Napster a stay allowing the music trading service to stay online at
least temporarily.<p>
A federal judge had ordered Napster earlier this week to stop
its business of helping people share copyrighted music for free
over the Internet. That preliminary injunction was supposed to have
gone into effect at midnight, Pacific time."
