Random observation: this is <i>precisely</i> why Eric Raymond et al created the "OpenSource" tag.  The free-fanatics could never live with you calling the wordviewer "freeware" since it isn't even remotely free from Stallman's perspective.  The fact that you used the term and the fact that we all knew what you were talking about, though, shows the fallicy in Stallman's continuing instance on using that term.<p>

Hrm.. maybe "gratisware" would be better...
