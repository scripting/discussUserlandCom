From the website:<p>

<blockquote><i>BBEdit is designed for the editing, searching,
transformation, and manipulation of text.
</i></blockquote><p>

Yes, it is also a fine editor for HTML, but so is Emacs.  I simply
don't see how you can continue to maintain that they don't compete.
Obviously, BBEdit is a commercially availible tool with <a href
="http://www.bbedit.com/products/bbedit/key.html">a feature set</a>
similar to a GPLed tool.  There is a <a href ="http://mac-emacs.sourceforge.net/">Mac port</a> of Emacs, so
this isn't an issue of them not competing.<p>

<i>The same is true of UltraEdit; it's a specialized editor and not a
conventional text editor.</i><p>

Do you check your facts?<p>

Reading the <a href
="http://www.ultraedit.com/products/features.html">features</a> page
for UltraEdit, I see:<p>

<blockquote><i>Syntax highlighting - configurable, pre-configured for
C/C++, VB, HTML, Java, and Perl, with special
options for FORTRAN and LaTex. Multiple wordfiles
available for download</i></blockquote><p>

Seems to me that it is a general purpose editor.<p>

<i>Sorry, but the market for ordinary text editors is dead, dead,
dead.</i><p>

Can you still support this statement?  Do you have the financials for
the companies involved?<p>

Brett, GCC didn't kill the market for compilers any more than Emacs
killed the market for text editors.  Some people may have thrown their
hands up in consternation, but others obviously chose to continue
their work.<p>

Mark.
