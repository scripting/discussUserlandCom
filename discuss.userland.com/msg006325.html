<i>In fact, user.webserver.prefs.type2MIME already contains an entry for the binary type 'PDF '. When you look at the PDF file you imported, what binary type are they? </i><p>

I imported the file as text after changing (Mac) file type and creator to TEXT/MOSS. I can't see how to import it directly as pdf (PDF/CARO). PDF is I believe an ASCII only format so this should not be a problem. MainResponder is happy to return it as is, I think, but with Content-Type="text/html". My guess is if there were a way of persuading mainResponder to put "application/pdf" into the response header, then the browser would call Acrobat Reader/plugin rather than display it as raw pdf<p>


I'm not sure how I would import it as a binary (on a Mac): can you help?
