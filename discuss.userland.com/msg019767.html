I'm not masochistic enough to attempt a comprehensive dichotomy in this forum.  The fact that there could be semantic debate over what's "security" and what's not, however, does not mean it's OK to just assume that everything is "security".  The point is simply that openness has been shown to benefit security in a limited set of domains, and it is not correct to extrapolate this to all domains.  Equating inequal things is the hallmark of syncretism and superstition, and when you smell this happening there is usually a witch doctor upwind of you.<p>
