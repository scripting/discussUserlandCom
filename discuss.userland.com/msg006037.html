Congrats Dave, please post in the DG as you make progress and let us know how it comes. I've got RH 6.0 expressing its way across the pacific right now.<p>

I tried telneting into the system and got a prompt, you should be able to rock and roll from across the room. Fortunately none of the stock user id/password combinations work (tried root/root, admin/admin, etc.)<p>

Good luck.<p>
