This is a common misunderstanding of the word "free" when dealing with Linux or other GPL'ed/Open Source software. No one claims that using Linux costs nothing in terms of time and/or money. You may even pay for a package containing "free" software. But you have the freedom to do just about anything you want with that software as long as you don't try take away someone else's freedom to do the same. To remember this meaning of free, people from the FSF often say, "Think free speech, not free beer."
