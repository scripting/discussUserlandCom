The next ten years could be called the "twenty aughts". American Heritage Dictionary defines aught as "a cipher; zero." So 2001 is twenty aught one, 2002 is twenty aught two, etc. The collective 2001-2009 are the "twenty aughts".<p>

I really appreciated the next to the last paragraph in your post. Nobody has picked up on this, at least that I have read. It seems so obvious.<p>

Have a great vacation.<p>
