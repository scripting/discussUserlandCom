In the meantime, don't use the db.xxx verbs to work with guest databases. Use filemenu.open to open them. And use the <a href="http://search.userland.com/default?s=1&m=50&q=guest+databases&site=Frontier">search engine</a> to find references on working with guest databases. <p>

If you haven't worked in Frontier since 5.0.x, there's a lot of catching up to do, but we totally know how to work with guest dbs now, so ask questions and I'm sure someone will know what to do. <p>

(When asking questions, don't just ask how to make it work, say what you've tried already. And make an effort to find the info on the web, you won't get good results if you ask people to be your search engine.)
