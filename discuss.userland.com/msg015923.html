This is very good for simple programme to program interaction. Since RSS is gaining so much ground any tool based around mapping RSS to enable integration is a very good thing.
One thing to bear in mind is that there is a bug in Cold Fusion that doesn't like importing wddx that is returned as text/xml, text/plain solves this.<p>
