I have a few more in the pipeline: AddIt for easy adding of new pages and addURL for running web based additions to Links pages.<p>

That's the introduction, here's the question. Is anyone interested in helping me to turn these into a suite which can be downloaded as a package, with built in membership features, configuration from a menu etc?<p>

Why would you need this when I've got the wonderfull Manilla you may ask. Here's a couple of reasons: any feature can be added to any page on an existing Web site, the programs are simple to use ( e.g just put &#123;editIt()&#125; in your page), pages with these cgi's can be served from a an ISP's server which is not your Frontier server.<p>

I use these programs on many Web sites and have found them be extremely useful - and I know for sure that loads of people have downloaded and use EditIt. There must be loads of other folk who would be interested in using these cgi/macros. Is there an opportunity here?<p>

I don't think this would be a real difficult, time consuming project - so get in touch if this has sparked even a bit of interest in you.<p>
