It seems to me that it says which <outline> is expanded and which isn't, is that right? Now, if I load an OPML into my client, am I supposed to respect that? Is this the starting state? If my user expands or contracts an outline, do I transmit this back to wherever I loaded it from?</i><p>

Those are good questions and should be addressed in the spec.<p>

1. If you load an OPML document into your client, you may choose to respect expansionState, or not. We're not in any way trying to dictate user experience. The expansionState info is there because it's needed in certain contexts. It's easy to imagine contexts where it would make sense to completely ignore it.<p>

2. OPML is merely a file format, not a protocol. When you click on a link in an HTML document it doesn't transmit that back to the server, or in any way change the document stored on the server. I envision OPML being used in much the same way.
