In the newsletter I write things like: "Turn to page 117 in 'The Book'. Read the third paragraph.  Isn't that a dumb thing for the author to say...." etc.  The newsletter contains none of the original copy, only references of where to find it.  A certain bookstore/library has 'The Book' and my newsletter availible side by side on the same shelf.<p>

Is this situation a violation of copywrite?  I really don't known, but I sure hope not.  I see this as what is happening with Third Voice.
