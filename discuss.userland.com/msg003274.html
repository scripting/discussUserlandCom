Absolutely! The slowness of the medium is, in this case, an asset. Slowing things down in a RL meeting is often a key to reaching consensus. It reduces reactionary responses and bad interpersonal loops. <p>

I would add in technologically enforced tools for the old fashioned Quaker techniques of going around the circle one at a time. You could do the same thing in checking for people who will break consensus.<p>

I've been using anonymous mailing lists and chat for a couple of years now in conflict resolution work with nonprofit organizations. For almost twenty years I've been teaching meeting skills and leading meetings. An intelligent web site is a very exciting tool.
