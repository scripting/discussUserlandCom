<P>Some examples:
<BR><a href="http://audi.com">http://audi.com</a> [doesn't resolve]
<BR><a href="http://cmgi.com">http://cmgi.com</a> [doesn't resolve]
<BR><a href="http://useit.com">http://useit.com</a> [doesn't resolve. bad Jakob, no cookie]
<BR><a href="http://shopping.com">http://shopping.com</a> [doesn't resolve]
<BR><a href="http://ebay.com">http://ebay.com</a> [reroutes to www. after refreshed jump page]
<P>I'm OK with sites that do an invisible redirect, eg. av.com to www.altavista.com, or yahoo.com to www.yahoo.com.
<P>Is less typing always better? I know this convention came out of organizations that had a lot of other named machines before they had web servers, but the fact is that web traffic rules all right now. I'm sure some marketing people could give me a line about 'branding' but creating a barrier to finding your home page seems like a bad idea. Also, I think it might be a safe assumption that a user typing in just your domain is looking for general info.
<P>Of course I've also heard that setting things up to work with either is a pain in IIS, so that could be part of the problem...</p></p></p></p></p>
