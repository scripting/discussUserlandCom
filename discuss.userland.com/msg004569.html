As to Connected Executives, it is currently being revised. A new edition, tentatively retitled "Connecting Executives" (for the sake of the pun, as suggested by my gifted agent Christian Crumlish, because the book is directed both towards the executives who are connecting and the people who are connecting them), is currently being shopped around. If anyone knows publishers with the vision and wherewithall, now is the time tell us about them.
