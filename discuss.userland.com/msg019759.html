That's exactly the point I was making.  Security protocols and crypto are improved by public/peer review.  There is ample evidence for that, as you point out.  But saying that this rule applies to all the *other* parts of an OS is indefensible.  Windows and all other modern operating systems are based on security protocols and crypto algoritms that are public and peer-reviewed.  I apologize if my metaphor was a bit unclear, I was *contrasting* crypto with my house.  My (crypto <> house).  Crypto = open; house = closed.  Only the security parts of a system need to be open to improve security...  Cheers, -J
