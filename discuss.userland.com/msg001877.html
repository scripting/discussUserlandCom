Even SGI of the multicolored boxes (which get hidden under desks and in machine rooms) uses fairly neutral colors for their monitor cases (I'm sitting in front of a muted speckled gray one). Once we get over the "Isn't it cool that I have a (dishwasher|refrigerator|computer)" level of technology fascination and genital size compensation issues and they're just tools again we'll be back to beige.
