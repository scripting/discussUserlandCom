I'm the newbie who is enthrawled with the ideas behind Manilia because they complete Tim Berners-Lee's vision of editing being as important as browsing.  I'm the newbie who wants to be a part of all this.  But I'm not sure how.  <p>

Frontier is probably way out of my price range since I am only an end user.  When do all of these great technilogical leaps come down to Earth?  When will someone produce a NuoMedia which is actually fast.  A Desktop.com without the desktop (windows don't work).  <p>

I don't want to be left behind.  However, I don't see how this revolution is including me.
