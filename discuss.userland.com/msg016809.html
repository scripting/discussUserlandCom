Why hasn't the big complainers regarding lack of web standards (Apple, IBM, Adobe etc.)  just written a check to W3C to have them administer the development of an engine for each platform (common code base, perhaps) with the provision that it properly include all standards within a predetermined time after approval?<p>

Basically hand the engine back to the academics and let industry do what they will with the UI - hell, even RealBasic could manage the UI so anyone could make a browser. MSFT has gotten close to this with IE5/Mac (much to everyones amazement), but the engine isn't available.<p>

Dave, this would deliver the standard HTML engine that MacOS lacks and deliver it to everyone equally.
