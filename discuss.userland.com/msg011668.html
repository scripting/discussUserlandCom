<p><p>
The <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/www.w3.org">W3C</a>'s XML Linking Working Group is working on standards that will allow one to refer to a point or a range within another document without modifying or requiring anchors in the linked-to document.  The current drafts of these standards are XPointer and XLink.  When browsers implement XPointer and XLink (Mozilla and MS IE will likely be the first, they are very XML aware), annotation services (as well as other uses) will be able to provide their services without modifying the the actual bits of the original work.<p><p>

Note: this only addresses a technical point in this discussion, it does not attempt to address social or legal issues.
