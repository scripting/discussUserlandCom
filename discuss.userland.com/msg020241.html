It demands that the programmer who uses the code forfeit any chance to make money from his own work -- in fact, and to give it away not only to the person who produced the original code but to <i>everyone in the world</i>. What's more, there's no balance of values. If I use one line of your code and combine it with tens of thousands of my own, I am still compelled to give <i>all</i> of my work away. This is unreasonable. If you want to license code (say, a subroutine library) to me personally and get something finite in return, that's fine. It's done all the time. But the license you propose above sets no limits on what I might be giving up. It requires me to give up value to a potentially infinite number of third parties and destroy my prospects of earning a livelihood. This is forced forfeiture, and it is not fair, reasonable, or ethical.
