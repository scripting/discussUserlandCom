Yes, it's politics. I thought you were fairly rude in that you didn't answer me when I asked to use the frontier documentation for coderef.com. I wrote you twice, you asked me why you should let me put ads on your content, and then I wrote a long explanation of why, and you ignored it.<p>

I didn't really care whether I could use your stuff or not, but a yes or no would have been nice. Incidentally, I'd still like to use it, and there probably won't be any ads. But then again I haven't worked on coderef.com in ages.<p>

If you want to be on the linkwatcher list, all you or anyone else has to do is ask. But... I'm going to assume that <i>was</i> your way of asking, so I'll add you in... :)<p>
