Really. We make decisions every day that are based on a model of what it is and isn't. At the time The Book was written, there was a lot of disbelief in the Frontier community. By now it should be clear.<p>

Frontier is a web application environment. Probably the richest and most complete and debugged one on the market.<p>

Manila and Pike are very different from Frontier. They're for writers and designers not programmers.
