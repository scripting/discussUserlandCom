How can you call an OS that might loose it's mouse when a printer is added or loose it's video card when a notebook is docked a fine OS?<p>

Windows NT is not a fine OS.  When it's all you have for a few months and it works you might start to think it's an acceptable OS, but that's just because the longer you live in a Windows only world the less you expect of an OS.<p>

Sincerely,<p>
