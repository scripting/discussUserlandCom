It's a stunning and awing exhibit.  We take our bodies for granted, but this exhibit reveals them as the vessels they are: containers of life, young, old, sickly, strong.  <p>

I recall walking through the entire exhibit almost wordless.  <p>

The Osaka exhibition drew large crowds--in fact, it was re-exhibited the next year as well.
