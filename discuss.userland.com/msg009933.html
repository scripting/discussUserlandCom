Dave:<p>

That's a pretty strong opinion there, tossed off without much of an explanation. I'm tempted to post at slashdot RE: this *grin*, but I really don't get into those Holy War type discussions...<p>

To clarify; what defintion of quality does Perl fail, and Python excel at? In terms of "excellence of value or worth", are you saying that Perl is a failure? Do you really think that Perl is of no use; on the Net or elsewhere? Come on, Dave...<p>

Or do you mean "quality of design" as in "prettiness"? Even that can be debated, but how relevant is that? I just feel like you're comparing apples to oranges here; Perl is a highly-used (understatement), well-liked language that Gets The Job Done. You may not like it; I do. To me, using whitespace for syntax is a pain when you're writing scripts to build scripts, INI files, etc. I don't see how the quality of Open Source software is called into question based on Perl!<p>

As for Mozilla, I'd say it's a poster child for the "pain-in-the-buttness" of taking a HUGE closed-source project and opening it up, and expecting miracles. There has been quite a bit written on the mistakes made ( <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/mozilla-at-one.html">internal to Mozilla </A>, and otherwise <A HREF="http://slashdot.org/articles/99/04/05/1351211.shtml">here (comments on preceding essay)</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworldtoday/lwt-indepth7.html"> here (read down for RMS's comments) </A> ,among others. The first point being that Mozilla wasn't something people could run "out of the box", to start working with! Not an Open Source problem, a mozilla.org issue ignoring one of the "first rules" of Open Source (see <A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar-9.html">Cathedral and the Bazaar, Necessary Preconditions...(plausible promise)</A>). Are you in disagreement with ESR's "Cathedral...Bazaar" essay in toto?<p>


PS: RMS = Richard M. Stallman; GNU founder, president of FSF.<p>

PPS: ESR = Eric S. Raymond; Open Source software maintainer, essay writer, etc.
