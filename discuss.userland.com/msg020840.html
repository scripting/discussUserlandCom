What exactly does O'Reilly have invested in it?<p>

Of course you can keep the RSS 1.0 name. I'm not going to sue you or O'Reilly or Guha over it. I can't change the bits on their website, or on the eGroups site. They could call it Pope John Paul if they want. <p>

"the pope"<p>

On the other hand, it doesn't stop anyone else from calling their work RSS 1.0 or 2.0 or 12.0 or whatever they want.
