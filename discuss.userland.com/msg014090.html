Dreamweaver is useful for creating things you can look at, and even things that do a little bit of responding to you, but I want a servant -- I want to go to places that can do things for me, that remember what I like and anticipate my desires based on what other people like -- and Dreamweaver in itself doesn't yet address that sphere.<p>

(Going back a ways, it's sort of like the difference between a QuickPICS file and a HyperCard stack... one you look at, one responds to you... HTML development right now is still more focused on creating static things than invoking interactive experiences, memory, and human anticipation.)<p>

Maybe I read the article from an angle awry, but it almost seemed like a validation for what's going on here at this site, with Frontier and content systems and user-editability and all. Dreamweaver has some front-end interactivity, but it doesn't offer the back-end interactivity that will be so cool. Does this take seem valid to you, too...?<p>
