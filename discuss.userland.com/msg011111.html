"Third Voice is a centralized discussion group that organizes itself around a database of URLs/websites.  Once integrated with a user's browser, it allows you to follow discussion threads associated with a particular URL while you view the actual page, giving the appearance that messages are posted to a web site rather than to the thirdvoice servers."<p>
