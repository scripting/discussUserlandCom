From what I gather so far, there isn't an interface to do this yet from a message.<p>

I'm trying to do this on a DG I'm setting up.  I can deal with doing it by hand if I could just figure it out.  My first task is to enclose a suite in a DG message so that people can download and perhaps comment on it.<p>

I've tinkered a bit.  I've had partial success but I think the spec may have changed from the early experiments.  I've knocked around on Userland.  Found some things Dave wrote.
