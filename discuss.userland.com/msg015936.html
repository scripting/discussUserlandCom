<i>"Endeavors Technology is proud to announce
the initial beta release of Version 0.5 of its open source,
Apache-based, personal desktop Web server software.  Magi combines
HTTP-based buddy and presence information with dynamic
WebDAV access controls to allow users, their buddies, or agents to
share, remotely author, or synchronize documents and data
across a variety of machines--even if they are connected to the
Internet through a dialup or behind a firewall.  <p>

More information is available at <a href="http://magi.endeavors.org/">magi.endeavors.org</a> "</i><p>

I've taken a quick look at their Web site and, at least on the surface, it seems that there are a number of ways Magi could complement and play nice with Pike, XML-RPC and the Userland philosophy.
