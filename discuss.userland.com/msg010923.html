Would it be possible to completely remote-administer the Frontier Server?<p>

I don't want to set Frontier up as a web server, but as a CMS for browser/frontier based website management, perhaps additionally as a CGI/ASP-Server behind IIS. Are there any serious issues involved when I can't get my hands on the actual box (e.g. can I get the machine to reboot on a regular basis). Has anybody experienced similar Scenarios?<p>

Thanks, Sean
