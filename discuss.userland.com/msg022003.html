Bryan Bell, our designer, finally had enough of it and designed a more straightforward button, illustrated above. Since I'm the one writing the docs, I welcomed it immediately; even though I know that later it may be a problem, when other Two-Way-Web editors come online, it's going to seem weird to click on a button named Edit With Radio to edit a document in Emacs or BBEdit. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.<br><br>The latest AmIHotOrNot <a href="http://www.brunching.com/cgi/amipresidentornot.cgi">ripoff</a>.<br><br>New sample: <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$181">Counting words in an outline</a>.<br><br><a href="http://derschockwellenreiter.editthispage.com/2000/11/29"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/microBBanimes.gif" height="53" width="62" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></a>I was going to leave for New Orleans on Sunday, but with so many things piled up on my desk (good things) I've pushed it back to Wednesday. I've got to write my next XML Magazine column, on <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/bootstrappingTheTwoWayWeb">bootstrapping</a> and SOAP; and I've got to finish the next version of the Radio UserLand website. We're also getting a new release of the Radio app ready, and a bunch of new websites are coming online. Busy busy busy.<br><br>
