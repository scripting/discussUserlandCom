I use it successfully with Manila.  It's pretty, it's polite, it co-exists well with Manila.<p>

Drawbacks:  
1) it only shows the last 10 hits.<p>

Draw"forwards":
1) (see above)
2) the stats are emailed to you as a report once a week
3) you can configure lots of aspects of the counter
4) YOU CAN ASK IT TO NOT COUNT YOURSELF in the totals  
5) It's pretty.  Did I mention its pretty?  :)
6) At the risk of mentioning the "S" word, it allegedly tracks Search Engines that lead ppl to you.  But I haven't got that aspect to work and haven't really been interested.  Sounds useful tho.<p>

Just a thought . . . . <p>
