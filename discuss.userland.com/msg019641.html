I had two roomies in college: David - a full-time dive instructor, who was around 30 at the time - and Geoff - a guy who painted our entire living rooom in bizarre hallucination-inspired *things* (walls & ceiling - even ceiling fan!) and introduced me to world of drugs.<p>

So anyway, one day out of the blue David had a heart attack.<p>

He lived through it, but to this day I believe it was drug related. No matter, upon learning what had happened, Geoff & I proceeded to call David's girlfriend to let her know.  Well, lucky me got the dreary duty of telling her what had happened...<p>

So I tell her, and then she asked "Are you serious?"  Then I said, "Yes... <i>serious as a heart attack.</i>"  <big sinking feeling&gt; And then, while Geoff ran out of the room laughing at my stupidity, I sat there listening to her sob, and thinking just how really dumb it was to say that.<p>

That day I felt like Vonnegut's Kilgore Trout... looking around for life, but seeing nothing but robots... and feeling like I had failed the test.  What a lesson to learn!<p>

Anway, that's it... nothing but a *stupid-but-true* life experience to hopefully crack a smile out there.<p>
