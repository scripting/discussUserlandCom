1) What are these protocols? Where are they defined?<p>

2) What is the mapping from RMI to that protocol?<p>

For example, it isn't obvious to me how to run RMI over 1394; that needs to be defined somewhere and I don't see it on Sun's site. If this is left up to individual vendors then Jini isn't truly an end-to-end solution and thus does not guarantee that two devices that have the same kind of port can interoperate.<p>

This lack of specifics leads me to believe that either Jini isn't finished or the full information needed to use it isn't available to the public.
