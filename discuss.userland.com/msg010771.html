No padding zeros?<p>

How then would it translate "12399"? As January 23 or as December 3? <p>

Or would they pad with 0s if and only if the date would otherwise be ambiguous? (which would be a pretty complicated and ugly solution, btw)<p>

I have a hard time believing anybody coded dates without padding 0s. They'd have bigger problems than a September Ninth problem.
