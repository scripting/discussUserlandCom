I don't know of anything 'official' but you would probably want to do something similar to what UserLand did with Pike/Manila RPC functionality.  <p>

You would need to abstract out the calls and functionality of the calendar (to keep with your example) and then as part of implementation, the calls would be supported no matter what the language.<p>

Does this make sense?<p>
