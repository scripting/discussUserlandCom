I guess I think the contents of the table should be invisible, if it is in a table designated for #renderTableWith.<p>

My example was misleading in naming the items "private" and "public".  I can't imagine an instance where I'd want any part of the table to be rendered w/o passing through the table rendering script.<p>

So my answer is there should be no option (b).<p>

Can someone think of a time you would want sub-table items to be renderable?
