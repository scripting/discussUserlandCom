GridBox is definitely for real, at least for me. Now as to whether others will want to use it, I'm not sure. I opened it up to share and get feedback because I thought the more heads the better. I know that just reading the specs doesn't really explain everything, but I'm working on a sample app to show how it works.<p>

I do a lot of ColdFusion work and using the Fusebox framework (which is what I'm using as a model for GridBox) really helps me focus on the code and not worry about the implementation. I want to bring the same thing to Frontier.<p>

I don't necessarily think I can solve the localization issues, but this framework might help. I haven't given it much thought so I can't really say.<p>

BTW, I'm a long time Frontier user (I use to build all the scripts that ran the graphics department at my previous employers - that was version 2.0), and I'm still diggin'!
