First boil some new potatoes until they're almost soft, but not quite mashable. Peel them. Grate. Add an egg and perhaps a little flour. A very little bit. Form them into pancakes and fry. Serve with applesauce and sour cream, and rich coffee with cream, perhaps a newspaper and smart people for conversation. <i>Yummy!</i><br><br>
