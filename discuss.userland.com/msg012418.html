But...<p>

How useful will this site be to me?<p>

I check Wired News each morning (once) and My.Userland.Com
every hour while I'm at work.<p>

Now, why would I go to SHWF?  My.Userland already shows these
feeds, doesn't it?<p>

And let's say that there are folks only interested in those
four news sources.  Okay, SHWF could be interesting to them,
but only if they are willing to hit it every hour.  Otherwise,
economy of effort will have them check each of the four sites
once a day, where the story lifetime is at least 24 hours.<p>
