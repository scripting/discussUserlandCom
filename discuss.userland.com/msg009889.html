The version of NT that came with the boxes simply did not have a driver for the Intel PRO/100 ethernet card (a standard option for the model). After trying for some time to get the (wrong) driver working, I had to pull out the network card to see what model it was and download the driver (fortunately ~1MB) from Intel. The NT setup also crashed once, so all in all it took several hours to set up the two machines. <p>

I then installed SuSE Linux on both PCs in about half an hour. It took one reboot per installation, and I could set up the network driver by simply choosing the driver from a list in the setup tool. (Already knowing the model was a bonus here.)<p>

Of course the tip of the iceberg is Compaq's wacky installation splash screen illustration. Obviously the need to distinguish themselves from other PC makers bears some strange fruits :)
