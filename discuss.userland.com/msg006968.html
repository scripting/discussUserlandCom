If you are in the developer program with Apple and have access to the seeds, the Help SDK is currently available in beta form. Below are my session notes that briefly describe what Apple is trying to do with the rendering.<p>

-Inet. and Web Tech. : HTML Rendering Library<BR>
	Based on Help Viewer<BR>
	HTML 3.2 compliant<BR>
-Inet. and Web Tech. : Renderer Goals<BR>
	Capable enough, small enough, fast enough, read only<BR>
	Not bleeding edge, not a browser<BR>
-Inet. and Web Tech. : Renderer<BR>
	Follows links for file, http and mailto<BR>
	Frames, tables (nested)<BR>
	Uses Internet Control Panel<BR>
-Inet. and Web Tech. : Renderer - Not supported<BR>
	Forms, Javascript, plugins, style sheets, XML<BR>
-Inet. and Web Tech. : How To Use<BR>
	Check if available<BR>
	What window/rectangle to render in<BR>
	Tell it the URL and file/buffer<BR>
	Draw it<BR><p>


Hopefully that helps to clear some issues up - it seems like a good technology to use. Although it doesn't support XML, XML will be supported within the OS via the Core Foundation Classes (probably in OS 8.7 and above).<p>
