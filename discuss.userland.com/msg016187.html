If I remember my Civics lessons correctly, the First Amendment restricts the federal government from interfering with free speech. It places no such restrictions on state government, corporations, or citizens.<p>

So I'm wondering if Conxion really challenged your First Amendment rights, or instead challenged what you believed was a "fair" use of the internet as a publishing medium.<p>

First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America:<p>

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
