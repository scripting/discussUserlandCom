MacWEEK: <a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/1999/03/07/registerwed.html">Why MacOS X Server</a>? The question had crossed my mind too. Playing Monday Morning Quarterback, Apple would have done well to invest in WebSTAR. <i><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3944">Sorry</a>!</i><p>

In May l998, US President <a href="http://www.calmanac.com/PAW/paonline/almanac/morgue/1998/1998_05_06.clinton.html">Bill Clinton stayed</a> at the home of a Silicon Valley mogul, Steve Jobs. Chelsea Clinton, the President's daughter, three friends and an entourage of Secret Service agents had dinner at Buck's.<p>

Fortune: <a href="http://cgi.pathfinder.com/fortune/technology/1999/03/01/kim.html">A Cautionary Tale of Silicon Valley</a>. A grossly unfair story. Marimba was quiet for a long period after the initial hype. They're now selling software at an impressive rate. I was as critical as anyone of Marimba during their massive hype period, but this story doesn't  give Marimba credit for adjusting to the realities of their market, which they did.<p>

Salon: <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/21st/feature/1999/03/cov_11feature.html">Beauty and the Geeks</a>. "The most egregious aspect of the Fortune feature wasn't the article's text but its accompanying art. While the author criticized Polese for posing for 'glamorous close-up [photos] with her face softly lit and airbrushed, eyes beaming up at the camera,' Fortune decorated the article with a series of its own glamorous close-up photos of Polese, dolled-up and beaming at the camera. Apparently, Fortune wanted to criticize a woman for using her sex appeal and capitalize on that sex appeal at the same time -- to have its cheesecake and knock it, too."
