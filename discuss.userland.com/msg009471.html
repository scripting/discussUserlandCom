What Walter describes here is plagiarism and/or doctoring text, and I can see why a publication would want to fight that. However, linking to an article is entirely different that what he's talking about. As long as the original text is left intact and the content isn't put in a frameset that makes it appear to be what it's not, I don't see why they should have a problem with linking. Hopefully they'll see the light. :)
