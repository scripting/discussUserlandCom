That's definately one way to test these things out.<p>

Not to make light of either the free-speech issue, or the abortion issue (and anyone here is welcome to disagree with my political viewpoint), but before abortion was legalized, many doctors purposely broke the law in order to get test cases to the Supreme Court, where the legal status of abortions could be challenged. Without this kind of action, there would be no test case, and the law would have simply stood.<p>

Unfortunately, it seems as though it's all too common these days for people in this country to sell themselves out on their civil rights, for an enhanced, albeit false, sense of security and safety. Most people are perfectly satisfied with turning all kinds of information over to creditors, insurance companies, financial institutions, police and other government organizations, universities and schools, and even the damned phone compaines. We happily do this because it's easier most of the time to just say 'ok' and give over the information they want so we get what we need.<p>

Many Americans are also more than happy to support laws that would restrict very heavily their right to free expression, in order to 'protect the children'... But from what? From their sexuality? From their emotions? From naughty words? Hey folks, it's a big scary world out there, but if you're not prepared to go out and play nicely in it, you'll most likely fail.<p>

I could go on, but I think I'll spare y'all my ramblings...
