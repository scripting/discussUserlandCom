This is an interesting problem, and I believe what you are after is a subset of a more general problem:  <I>co-evolutionary objects</I>.  <p>

I gave it some thought and have sketched <a href="http://www.inch.com/~joubin/alphazero/CoEvolution/coevolut1.htm">a preliminary design for CoEvolutinary objects</a>.<p>

Click on the diagrams to walk through the idea.  The underlying software system is not presented, though I believe it to be apparent.  But if it is not clear, let me know and I'll flesh it out.<p>

<I>Generally speaking</I>, I don't see any reason why you should not be able to implement this over Frontier, but any networked ODB will do.  But I think frontier is well positioned to support this application in many aspects.  <p>

<I>Specifically in regards to Frontier 6's DG</I>, I believe that this software (DG) is inadequate to the task, as a discussion group, by definition, is an object <i>tree</I> editor, where as I believe the solution to what you are after is a specialized <I>Graph</I> editor.<p>

[If you are not up on your <I>geekspeak</I>, take a look at the top of this page:  See where it says 'Msg#: 3284 (in response to 3280)'?  Any message can have many responses, but each response can ONLY be to one message.  That's a tree.  In a graph however, any response can be retraced back to </I>many</I> previous messages to reflect the merging (i.e. synthesis) of co-evolving threads.]
