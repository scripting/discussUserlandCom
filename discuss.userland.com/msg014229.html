I swear I've seen librarians do this before. <p>

I might be a bit hazy on it, since it was in elementary and middle school when librarians were helping me with searches. <p>

Perhaps we should patent the Electronic Librarian. <p>

What is claimed is: <p>

    1. In a computer system that implements a search engine which is accessible to a community of users, a method of assisting users in refining search queries to enhance discovery, the method comprising the computer-implemented steps of: 
<ol>
<li> An email client and a well publicized email address.
</li><li> A librarian answering the email, returning well correlated results. 
</li><li> An artificial intelligence subroutine (Eliza (tm)) to suggest further inquiries. 
</li>
</ol><p>

Coming soon, Electronic Freud, also rebranded as Electronic Jung.<p>

Oh sorry, a+b has been done (<a href="http://www.kuow.org/rewind/askhelen.htm">http://www.kuow.org/rewind/askhelen.htm</a>)
And I'm sure I could find c on the net. <p>

You know, I think what I really want to do with my life is Rebrand and Synergize. Submarine patent poaching would be lucrative too. Marketing will make the bad taste go away. Make the appearance of something out of nothing plus billions of my investor's dollars. Because what is marketed is real, and it is only validated if at least 27.3% (+-5%) of 1003 nationially selected respondents agree. <p>

It makes Microsoft's business strategy look positively friendly. 
(At least they have net revenue. (roughly 1-2 billion net per quarter, on 4-5 gross, by comparision, the e-commerce christmas season gross was reportedly in the 4 billion range with maybe -1 billion net. ))<p>

I wonder if the hyperlink is patented yet.<p>
