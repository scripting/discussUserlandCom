I don't know if it's Frontier-centric or not, or it may be just that we have an outliner, and that it would be simple in any outliner, just not simple in a dynamic application that's generating OPML output.<p>

If I were writing a dynamic application I would just leave <expansionState> out altogether, or maybe just put a 1 in there, to indicate that the first level is to be expanded, and nothing more.<p>

The feature is there primarily for remembering the state of the outline for a user who's editing it, or an author who wants to present the outline in a certain way when another outliner user opens it.<p>

We could certainly add an attribute that duplicated the functionality, something like isExpanded would be parallel with the other "common attributes" that are explained in the spec.<p>

This approach of course would add overhead to the file, a fair amount. And luckily it can be addressed later, when we have more of an installed base and more experience with how people are using the format.
