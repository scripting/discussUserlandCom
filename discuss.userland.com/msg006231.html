My take, from looking at the LinuxPPC, Yellow Dog, and TurboLinux
distributions is that LinuxPPC is probably the most mature (it's based
on the standard Red Hat distribution).  Yellow Dog seems pretty stripped
down (there are packages missing from their standard distribution that I
would have thought would have been included), but they have a nice logo
and pretty binders and shirts.  TurboLinux has been around for a while,
and runs on other platforms (i386) and has support for other languages
(Chinese).  I don't know anyone who runs it, though, and I haven't heard
much about it that makes me understand why people would choose
TurboLinux over another distribution.<p>

for the latest news on most everything Linux.<p>

If you can wait (or help), there's also a PPC port of Debian Linux
(<<a href="http://www.debian.org/">http://www.debian.org/</a>>), probably the purest of all Linux
distributions.<p>

As far as Darwin is concerned, it's good for Apple from a licensing
standpoint (Darwin, being *BSD-based, is under the BSD license rather
than the GPL, which means that Apple can preserve (or protect) its
investment more easily), a historical standpoint (*BSD has been around
for a long time and has had most of the bugs beaten out of it), and from
a technological standpoint (Mach is still great technology).  Apple is
warming to the idea of open source software slowly, but they are
warming.  With Darwin, they've released source (and now binaries) which
could allow Mac OS X Server (and thus, Mac OS X) to be ported to older
machines (like my own PowerCenter 132) as well as Intel machines.  They
still need to be a bit more forthcoming with some of the details about
how the older hardware works for things to really get going.<p>

(And, as long as I'm mentioning *BSD, NetBSD (<<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">http://www.netbsd.org/</a>>
and OpenBSD (<<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">http://www.openbsd.org/</a>>) also have ports to the PPC
architecture underway.)
