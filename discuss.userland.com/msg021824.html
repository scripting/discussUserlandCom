Give them your email address on the their home page. When they reply (keep in mind they're rather heads-down so I have no idea when that will be) tell them you want to "be one of the first to get into the Groove." Explain why. Admiration and respect for Ozzie's earlier work will go a long way, I'm sure.<p>

It <i>isn't</i> a secret that they are looking for early adopters - or they wouldn't have that on the home page.
