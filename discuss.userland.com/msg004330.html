When I launch Frontier, I got many errors saying the Nirvana-related root files cannot be found.<p>

My original thought was that it's simply the problem with user.database. So I went in and changed the paths there.<p>

When I launched again, I still got the errors.<p>

After tracing all the scripts, I finally corrected all of them.<p>

Am I missing something? Do I not get the latest update? Or, is there really problem on moving Frontier 6 to a total different folder structure?<p>
