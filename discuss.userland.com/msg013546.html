I've spoken with him on the phone. He is sincere. He supports the company he works for. He gave us a thoughtful explanation of the situation from his point of view. I found a lot I could relate to. It's not a problem he created. I can think of a dozen other things I'd like to say in his defense, but instead of defending, let's try to stay friendly here, so not so much defending is needed.
