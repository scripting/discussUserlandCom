It will be held at Michael Gilbert's apartment on Capitol Hill.<p>

We are going to do a demo of some of the code that Michael Gilbert has been working on lately and cover some of the new features of 6.1<p>

We also have the beginnings of a website at <a href= "http://www.wiredfool.com/stories/storyReader$11">Wired Fool: Seattle FUG</a>. Incidentially, this is part of a larger manila site.<p>
