It seems fairly clear that OS X is going to be the replacement OS for the MacOS come hell or high water, and Apple's market share is doing reasonably well that I think we can conclude they will not just go away anytime soon.<p>

My moving to OS X, UserLand can provide not just the hosting solution, but the client solution as well, and maybe not have to manage 3 codebases. OS X is also unix, so the technical benefits should be the same as Linux. OS X is also MacOS, so that Frontier/Mac (the current product) should go away. I don't see people using Frontier/linux on a desktop anytime soon, not like I see Frontier/Mac...
