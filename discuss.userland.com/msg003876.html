I have the same problem as you with the "Word Memos" at work... and I'm not even running Linux!  The company I work for has "standardized" on the full set of MS products (i.e., <i>everything</i> is MS).  However, I work in a development environment with Solaris workstations.<p>

My solution to this was to setup an IMAP server on my Unix box.  The server was simply looking at my regular mailbox.  Whenever I got a Word document (or Powerpoint or Excel or other MS-only format), I would simply go to my NT box that I use for it's cooool screensaver, connect to my IMAP server, and read it from there.  It's a <i>little</i> inconvenient... but it works.<p>

If you are more flexible than I, you might want to try StarOffice.  Supposedly the filters are quite good.<p>

I agree that the lack of familiar applications is frustrating when trying to use Linux in a production environment.  For instance, when I tried to bring Linux into work, the idea was nixed because we use FrameMaker for our documentation and there is no FrameMaker for Linux.<p>

My reaction was that Frame is the Wrong Way to go, anyway.  We should be doing all of our docs in SGML or XML or some other open standard.<p>

What it came down to, though, was even if I could find something in Linux that did the exact same think as Frame, they still wouldn't go along with it because our standard for development work is FrameMaker.  Period.<p>
