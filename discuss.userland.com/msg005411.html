I took a look there and I don't think this will solve my problem. Here's the offending line from the op.getCursor docserver page:
  	The marker is guaranteed to remain valid only as long as 
	the window remains open, or the target remains set, 
	and as long as the original heading has not been deleted.<p>

That means that I can't switch to a different outline, do some things and switch back. In other words, this kind of flow:
	target.set(something)
	loop
		local (marker = op.getCursor())
		local (old_target = target.get())
		bundle
			local (addr = address(op.getLineText())
			target.set(addr)
			<a href="//">//</a> go do something at the new outline
		op.setCursor(marker)
		target.set(old_target)
		if (op.go(down,1) == false)
			break<p>

This is the kind of thing I'm trying to do. When I spoke of recursive, I meant recursive in the sense of working on different outlines, not recursively working on the same outline. Does this make sense?<p>

Thanks again for any info.<p>
