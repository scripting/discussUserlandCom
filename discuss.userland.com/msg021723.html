There have been a few stories in the press about how Cheney's performance on the campaign trail has made Republican insiders unhappy.  I can imagine an offhand remark about "oh, if only Powell were the VP candidate..." being blown up into this kind of rumor.

At any rate, I don't think it will happen.  I doubt that Bush would want either Powell or McCain as his running mate, and even if he did, I doubt that either of them would take the job.  I also don't see how suddenly changing his running mate would help Bush in the election -- wouldn't it just contribute, in the eyes of swing voters, to his image as someone who's fumbling his way through the campaign?
