Step by step, what is Third Voice doing?<p>

This is what I heard: "They install a proxy server on the client machine and reconfigure the browser to talk to that server."<p>

You say they make modifications. What mods do they make? Do they put my site inside a frame? A screen shot might help, I have not installed Third Voice, and I don't plan to. But I guess we'd better learn enough about it to understand what's going on.
