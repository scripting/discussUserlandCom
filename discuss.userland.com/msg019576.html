Revolutionary Napster-Like Application Unveiled;
8/8/0 15:41 (New York)<p>

         Features File Sharing Integrated with AOL Instant Messaging 
 
    ALBANY, N.Y., Aug. 8 /PRNewswire/ -- In the midst of uncertainty about the 
future of Napster and its millions of devotees, a new Napster-like Internet 
application has been developed in Troy, N.Y., and unveiled at the website, 
Aimster.com.  The application, called Aimster, is being hailed by its 
developers as "the first Napster-like file sharing integrated with AOL Instant 
Messaging." 
    Johnny Deep, author of several Internet-related books and spokesperson for 
the developers, said, "Aimster reflects a significant step toward implementing 
universal file-sharing because for the first time users can search and share 
files within circles of online friends." 
    Aimster's integration with AOL Instant Messaging allows users to search 
and share files exclusively with their AOL Instant Messaging "buddies," and 
thereby enjoy greater privacy and security protections.  Unlike Napster, 
Aimster gives users significantly more control over who can access their 
shared files and computers, and also lets users share not only music but any 
personal content. 
    "There is huge market potential for tools that allow people and businesses 
to easily setup private peer-to-peer networks," said Jeff Nixon of Interactive 
Capital Partners. "It's the next natural evolution in personal communications 
after email and instant messaging and it helps further unlock the most 
powerful part of the network, the knowledge of each person that makes up the 
network." 
    "Aimster brings together two of the most powerful Internet applications 
out there today," said Mr. Deep. "The combination of file-sharing and instant 
messaging allows people to create their own instant private networks." 
    "This application is the future of the Internet.  Its users will find it 
to be fun, easy -- and addictive," he said. 
 
    Aimster is based on a patent-pending intelligent switching technology 
developed by a newly formed Troy, N.Y. communications company.  Aimster is 
available for Windows 95/98/NT/2000 and can be freely downloaded from
