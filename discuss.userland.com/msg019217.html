I am experimentally authoring a "living" Userland white paper. That's fancy talk for a hypertext paper with lots of links. It will ultimately include links to some of the community's weblogs and development projects as well as the obvious Userland content.<p>

This might eventually become an "official" or semi-official Userland source for tech media and/or people exploring purchase/use of Frontier.<p>

A couple of heavyweight industry dudes have offered to be readers and reviewers of the white paper if it gets to that stage.<p>

I would be grateful if some of you guys would amble over to the URL below, take a good look and give some feedback on the overall concept and structure. Even better would be signing up as members and/or editors.<p>

Criticizing the concept or the execution is acceptable .... ;-). Life is too short for this unless it is truly valuable.<p>
