Yep, this stuff can be wacky. But there are many 
good cloners out there. You just have to follow
the word of mouth trail.<p>

Minor instance:<p>

When my little company, Soda Mountain, builds a system,
we install and test the OS(es) and all the purchased
applications before shipping the machine. The machine arrives
ready to run. <p>

For example: tomorrow I'm shipping a dual-boot, via System
Commander, machine. It runs NT 4 Service Pack 5 and 98 2nd
Edition. It's been running in the shop for the past 7 days.
We normally do a 100 hour burn in, but like to do a week
on dual-boot machines. We've set up the network, we've
set up the applications, we've set up the Internet, and
it's all been tested.<p>

Internally, all cabling is wire-tied and anchored. We ship
in dual-flotation boxes: machine in styrofoam in box in
air bags/styrofoam in box. We use the best retail (no OEM)
parts we can find.<p>

We don't build a lot of boxes --- 200 or so a year
is our current run rate --- but they arrive working, and keep on
working (we convince most customers to buy pcAnywhere, so we
can monitor small issues remotely).<p>

There are other folks out there doing the same thing,
delivering Things That Work. Ya just gotta find 'em.<p>
