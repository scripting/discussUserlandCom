I've got a whole sequence planned out. Tomorrow's goes like this.<p>

<b>The idea</b><p>

To find out how people self-categorize themselves. <p>

A suit would be a busdev, marketing or sales person. A geek would be a programmer or other kind of technical person. A designer is someone with a tatoo, purple hair, long sideburns and/or pierced nipples. A board member would be a VC or angel investor or retired but semi-active cashed out former entrepreneur. <p>

The purpose of the survey is to capture the color of the current Scripting News audience, without asking what color you are.<p>

BTW, all the people who split hairs over surveys are clearly geeks!<p>
