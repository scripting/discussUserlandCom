There is _nothing_ in the spec about "TCP".  <p>

Jini sits on top of Java Spaces, which defines (2!) two <I>interfaces</I>:
<UL>
<LI>Entry
<LI>JavaSpace
</UL><p>

The only exposure to RMI at the Java Spaces layer is the <RemoteException> thrown by the interface (which is a standalone class, and you can throw it too ;). <p>

Most of the serious exposure to RMI <Remote> (interface) is incured in Transaction layer due to its use of <I>interfaces</I> which extend <Remote>, which are at worst case, mappable to an equivelant IIOP IDL.<p>

In any event, java.rmi.Remote (an interface) can be supported by classes other than sun's TCP based <I>implementation</I> of the RMI architecture.  So if you want RMI over PSTN <g> there is nothing stopping you from delivering just that.  Simply stop extending java.rmi.server.* classes and extend your own implementation classes.<p>

That would take care of "TCP" dependencies.</li></li>
