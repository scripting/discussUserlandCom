As for the system, i am building a complete internet media testing engine.  We had been hoping to hook into all the commercial servers out there but that turned out to have a good deal of political ramifications and the big companies are already working on similar things, so we have decided to turn directions and serve our own ads.<p>

As I understand it, you can use your own systems to serve ads on geocities, they simply put the coding into their system, and point the ad requests to yours.<p>

Essential to this system is communication between the monitoring system and the ad management system.  If an ad campaign is deemed unprofitable, it must be removed asap.  And a sucessful campaign must be pushed into a higher rotation.<p>
