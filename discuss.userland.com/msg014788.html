All the time I was thinking how I would explain what I was doing to someone who wasn't a writer.<p>

In 1994, when I started writing a column I tended to write top to bottom and then do a lite edit and ship it. Nowadays I spend a week preparing to write a piece. And when I sit down to write it's often three columns that get squeezed down into one. It's more powerful writing. I trust the intelligence of the reader to connect the dots. I use subtle cues to help assure they connect them correctly.<p>

Writing is like engineering, but it hardly has anything to do with user interface.
