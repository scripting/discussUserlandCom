I did this as well :-)<p>

The 7% unsupported don't look bad at all.  A lot of it is just PBxxx calls that need to be changed to PBHxxxx, things like MaxAppleZone to get rid of, a bit of updating of the printing interface (printer records are not 120 bytes anymore, they are instead an opaque interface) and the like.  I'm sure there will be some nasty's -- there is some playing around with resource maps that may or may not be hard to redo -- but it dosn't look to be a big effort.  Probably comparable to porting between different plavours of Unix...
