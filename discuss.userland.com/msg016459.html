But word processing is not writing, it is editing. <p>

As a result, modern word processors are focused on reducing the easily visible, burdensome tasks once performed by secretaries. While the less visible, cognitive artistic activity of getting the words right is mostly a software-orphan.<p>

My ultimate fantasy: A writer's word processor. It does not exist, but it could. Imagine if a group of talented software engineers were to create an app based on the input from professional writers who work in a variety of disciplines. The result could be a dream application, a PhotoShop for words.<p>
