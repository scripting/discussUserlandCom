I'm trying to figure out what you want to do.<p>

Here's what it sounds like to me.<p>

You want one name to be either a table or a folder.<p>

So the responder would behave like this.<p>

First it would look in the table.<p>

If it doesn't find it there, it would look in the folder.<p>

Is this correct?<p>

We've had people ask for this before, and I just can't imagine how the responder would do that, how we would document it, and how long-term you would maintain such a site. But of course this may not be what you want, so I'll reserve further comment until you respond.<p>

Also, it would be helpful if we knew your name. See the "Who Are You?" link at the top of the page? That's how you tell the DG who you are.
