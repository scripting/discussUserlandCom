Your code is your calling card, as far as Linux kernel development is concerned.<p>

<i>Who decides who's on the core Linux team? Isn't it Linus? Or does it vary with the project? I don't see the difference.</i><p>

One of the MS objections: Linux has no roadmap. People involve themselves (and dis-involve themselves) in the project according to whim. Their relative importance can fluctuate rapidly: it's a fast-track up and down. While this may buck the Brooks principle that projects suffer from the involvement of increased numbers, I think it's open to valid criticism. There's a lot of <i>bricolage</i> in Linux development, and not necessarily a lot of architecture.
