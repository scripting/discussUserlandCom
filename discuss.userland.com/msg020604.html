But the different laws which apply to IP are themselves, arguably, obsolete. Furthermore, they have lately been weighted far to the side of the producers' rights, where originally there was a much better balance between rights of producers and consumers.<p>Any law should be considered in terms of its benefit to society, versus the cost to society of enforcing it. Current IP laws might be considered beneficial--but the only way to enforce them on the Internet is to introduce oppressive surveillance measures. I would argue that the cost outweighs the benefit, and we need to come up with new ways of rewarding producers that don't have such a cost.
