It's interesting after four years of Java WORA religion it's come back to that. That's what Bill Gates said. We tried WORA once before (at least). It was called the UCSD P-System. Well, guess what, few people wanted to use software written for a virtual machine, they wanted to use Apple II software, or IBM PC software<p>

BTW, I don't believe that the Mac way is better. I think that Brent is about to have a very interesting experience as he dives into C on Unix. On Unix, C is almost a scripting language, it's so simple. <p>

The Mac way yields applications that are a bitch to understand internally, but are easy to use editors of all kinds. The Unix approach makes very low-tech therefore highly reliable servers. <p>

When Unix gets a standard GUI, if it gets one as rich as Windows or Mac, it will require just as much head-banging to make the software work as users expect it to.<p>

You can push the piles around, but there are no silver bullets, you end up with the same soup if you use the same ingredients.<p>
