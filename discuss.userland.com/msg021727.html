I watched the same two programs concerning the old debates and the dictatorships. It's great that producers take the opportunity to create shows like that.<p>

I remember watching the Kennedy - Nixon Debates live at the time. Although I was only ten years old and didn't understand the issues, I remember thinking Kennedy was a man to respect. I remember John Kennedy's Inaugeration Speech live. His "Ask Not..." and "The torch has been passed to a new generation..." statements still affect me to this day.<p>

Generally, I think debates are necessary and should include as many contenders as possible. I prefer the town hall meeting format to the other styles. The only change I would make is for the random drawing of the people who want to ask questions so that their selection is less scripted.<p>


As for dictators, people find ways to route around them in one form or another. I'm impressed at what people can do for themselves in a clinch.<p>
