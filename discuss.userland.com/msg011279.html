AOLServer can server either static or dynamic or both. Ditto for Frontier. Zope is entirely dynamic. I'm not certain one can even serve static pages from Zope.<p>

From the stuff I've been been reading lately it seems that if one wants to build dynamic sites one has three choices: AOLServer; Frontier; and Zope. (I realise there are loads of other "choices", but these three seem to me to be comparable and unique.)<p>

AOLServer limits you to Unix and Linux. Frontier for now is Windows and Mac. Zope is Unix and NT.<p>

Documentation is pretty good for Frontier and AOLServer. Not very good for Zope.
