Discuss.root wouldn't open, the messages table, the one with 11,000-plus sub-tables had a bad bit or bits or whatever. It just wouldn't open, and without that table, there isn't much of a DG. "qbullet.sidesmiley"<p>

But our recovery plan seems to have worked. We archive every change to every message in XML. It appears I was able to recover all the messages that had been posted. The readcounts will be wrong, those aren't backed up. <p>

I have a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$1537">narrative</a> of the recovery process, so if other Frontier developers have a discuss.root crash, they'll have a set of scripts and a procedure to follow. I'll post a pointer to the narrative after cleaning it up a bit. I wrote it on another server, which was running fine.<p>

It was going to happen sooner or later. And now was as good as time as any.<p>

Onward! <i>Murphy-willing.</i>
