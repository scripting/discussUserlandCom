I have been asking Third Voice to develop a product for commenting on, and QAing Web pages.<p>

We have an extranet where we post all of our comps, designs, etc for client review.  This could be a great tool for us.  We could get feedback more quickly.  It's sort of like the notes that can be attached to PDF documents but Web-based.<p>

I would like Third Voice to add the abiliy to set permission levels by user. That way, we could comment on something internally without the client seeing the comments.<p>

I think Third Voice could be useful in this way. <p>

I wouldn't worry about Third Voice too much, I think the'll get sued before they can get any momentum going.
