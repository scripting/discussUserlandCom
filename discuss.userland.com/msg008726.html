A format change on the server had broken this app a few months ago. Glad to have it working again, in the interim, it seems they've made some improvements to the database. <p>

A bug report for Netscape. Under some circumstances some of the requests return poorly formed XML text. Still trying to figure out the circumstances. An example, <a href="http://www-rl.netscape.com/wtgn?http://www.yahoo.com/default">this query</a> returns correctly formatted XML when I go there in a browser, but the first child has a type attribute that is not in "double-quotes" when I do the request <a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/whatsrelated/default$http://www.yahoo.com/">from a script</a>. <i>Puzzling!</i> <p>

<a href="http://news.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$8731">10 Points for Fredrik Lundh</a>. For some reason Netscape sends well-formed XML only if the HTTP request appears to come from MSIE. I modified my script so that it does that, and it works now. Think about it. <i>It's weird!</i><p>
