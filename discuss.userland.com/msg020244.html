So is it unethical for plants and trees to provide oxygen?  They've driven its market value to zero and you can't make money selling it to me!<p>

<i>But this is what the GPL does to programmers. It deprives them of something which has no market value but great intrinsic value.</i><p>

But it doesn't deprive them!  The price of using GPLed code in your project is the price of releasing your modifications.  So why not look at it this way:  If it costs you US$100,000 to re-implement the functionality of my GPLed code, consider that the price I would otherwise assign to the code if I were going to license it to you.<p>

Yeah, the GPL is more restrictive than "Brett's Truly Free Licenses," but that's the point.<p>
