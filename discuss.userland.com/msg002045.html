Make it possible to build standalone executable applicatins in Frontier.  These apps would not have the editing features that are in the normal Frontier environment.<p>

Even if these apps have no UI but are just server objects it would be very very useful.<p>

If there is no license to distribute apps made with with the Frontier authoring/development environment then you will empower all of your current customers in a new and unique way.  If one of your customers uses Frontier to build a great web server application (say for managing some web based store), they could package it up and resell it without exposing the customer to their source.  For many people this is also about protection of the their IP (intellectual property) investment in the development of the package.<p>
