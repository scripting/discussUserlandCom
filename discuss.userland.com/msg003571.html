I can point out some bad examples of tabbed dialogs (MS Word's preferences spring to mind, especially how the categories bounce around when you choose one of them.)<p>

All I know to do is look at examples of uncluttered preference panels and imitate them.  Newswatcher (on the mac) is an example of a program that I feel has sweated the details to a point that most of it is very well thought out.<p>

I haven't had a chance to play with the dhtml version of your site, so I'm not sure I have the whole picture. I would start by rethinking the use of a tabbed dialog inside of a tabbed dialog.<p>

Perhaps some sort of collapsing outline control would be appropriate?<p>
