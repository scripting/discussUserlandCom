Like it or not there are still a lot of very powerful command line tools that are better than anything else for getting certain tasks done.<p>

I want to be able to invoke these commands from script and process their output in script.  In terms of the std C library I want to be able to popen a process so that I can pipe input into the command and pipe the output back into my script code.<p>

Fortunately, this isn't too hard to do.  As soon as I'm out of ship mode for IE 5 I plan to write a helper object that will do this for me.<p>

Also on my list is better high level tools for file management.  The filesystem object is fine but doesn't cut it for managing large numbers of files.  I want the equivalent of move, rename, copy and del (mv, mv, cp, and rm for my friends in Unix land).<p>
