To see how RSS <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/worldOutlineSnapshotAugust1.gif">integrates</a> with the World Outline concept. It works pretty well.<br><br>	Then Brent released the new app with the color icons, it <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/colorIconsInWorldOutlineSna.gif">looks a lot nicer</a> with a bit of color. BTW, it loads the icons from a folder, so users can change the icons easily. <i>Please do!</i><br><br><b>Doc at LinuxWorld<a name="docAtLinuxworld">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/16#docAtLinuxworld" title="Permanent link to 'Doc at LinuxWorld' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2000/08/16">Doc Searls</a>: "Eazel is a Finder.

A kind of personal aggregator. <br><br>	How to visualize it. Look at this <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1221">page</a>, and imagine the same content in an outliner. This could also be the test-bed for new publish-and-subscribe features for syndicated content. I have an inkling this will be easy. We'll see how it goes.<br><br>	At 4PM, it's <a href="http://static.userland.com/images/radiodiscuss/newsfeed2.gif">working</a>!<br><br>	Another new feature coming in the next few hours, <a href="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/internal/colorfulOutlines.gif">customizable color icons</a>.
