XML-RPC, WDDX, and LDO XML and binary serializations all are at the same layer, so in effect they should be plug-compatible.  Once the issue of protocol versioning is resolved we could simply say a new serialization plug-in is available and still stay backward and forward compatible.<p>

Regarding versioning, I don't recall anyone mentioning one of the possible solutions that's intended for that: the DOCTYPE declaration!  Specifically the PUBLIC identifier.  The doctype declaration MAY be used for validation, but it is not required to exist if you're only interested in well-formedness or are using a different schema for validation.  Possible doctype declarations for XML-RPC and LDO XML serialization are:<p>

  <!DOCTYPE methodCall PUBLIC "-//UserLand Software//DTD XML-RPC V2.0//EN" "http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/rpc.html"><p>

  <!DOCTYPE dictionary PUBLIC "-//The Casbah Project//DTD LDO XML V0.0//EN" "http://casbah.org/ldo/ldo-xml.dtd"><p>

The server can then select plug-ins based on the doctype.  They don't have to be really parsed, it could simply be a matter of looking for <!DOCTYPE, then snagging the string after PUBLIC to do the lookup.<p>

For backward and cross compatibility, I've been working on a plug-in selector that goes something like this:<p>

 1) Grab the first available bytes from the stream or HTTP content-body<p>

 2) Search for ``magic'' (in the Unix `file' command sense), if magic exists then we're done<p>

 3) Is it an HTTP request (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)?, then we're done, hand it off to the HTTP receiver<p>

 4) Is it XML (starts with `<')?<p>

    4a) does it have a doctype declaration? then we're done<p>

    4b) Parse the document until the first open-tag, use that to select the receiver<p>

>>I don't know when LDO appeared, but I wasn't aware of its existence when we designed XML-RPC.<p>

LDO binary started probably about the same time-frame as XML-RPC (February-March 1998).  Shortly after I wrote the Frontier-RPC module and posted my post-mortem to the frontier-xml I created the LDO XML format in response to a request for a possible update to XML-RPC.  Somewhere around then the frontier-xml list went away and we just kept on working on it within Casbah.  Since then we've had a somewhat different target audience (XML-RPC is closer to traditional procedural RPCs and LDO is closer to distributed object systems) so it wasn't clear that there'd be interest in changing.
