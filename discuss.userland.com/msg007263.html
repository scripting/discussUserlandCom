It isn't exclusively for them, the idea is that once they get a sense of which channels they like, they will join as a member, start choosing Favorites, and then the Favorites page will become more important to them.<p>

But when they're first starting out, how would they know that Motley Fool, Internet Alchemy and Robot Wisdom are frequently updated with interesting stuff, and that some other perhaps bigger-name sites aren't?<p>

I made the switch because I came to believe that the real product of this service is the Recently Updated Channels list. That's the reward system I want to set up. If you update frequently with interesting stuff, you'll get more readers.<p>

Note that if people choose infrequently updated channels, *we* get the rep for being uninteresting.
