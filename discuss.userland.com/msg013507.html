Dan Bricklin's <a href="http://danbsmanila.editthispage.com/">Manila site</a> now looks like Dan's "other" site.<p>

Jeffrey Zeldman: <a href="http://206.14.73.37/stories/died/article.txt">The Day the Browser Died</a>. A great piece. I was reading the HTML version until I found the link to the text-only version, and what a relief! To me, too much glitz is too much. Put it all on one page. I know how to use a scrollbar. No point worrying about CSS and standards. It's a big dream. Netscape is gone. <blockquote> works great. I still love Jeffrey. All his icons are in our <a href="http://glossary.userland.com/$11">glossary</a>.<p>

How the Global Glossary works: If you want an icon of Brigitte Bardot to appear in a story you write or a message you post, just type &quot;zeldman.bardot2" and our system will replace that with the picture. This works on all UserLand-hosted servers, including EditThisPage.Com.<p>

The <a href="http://wap.editthispage.com/wapaccess">WAP Today</a> site is weally wollin. They have a WAP version of Scripting News. Still trying to figure out what that means! ";->"<p>
