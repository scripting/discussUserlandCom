To everyone else, let me introduce my soul brother, Lance Knobel.<p>

He's the guy that got me into Davos earlier this year.<p>

He moderates discussions between people with tanks and bombs and refugee camps. <p>

What Lance does will be a big part of the Internet in the future. There will be a role for peacemakers, the people who get warring parties to come to the table and negotiate in a respectful manner. That's where the power is going to be, the power to make peace and create safe places for people to have fun.
