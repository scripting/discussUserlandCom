The reason I ask is that I sometimes "lose" replies when I'm out of town, or busy working on a project. With an email, I can at least file it away for when I get time, and have a reminder sitting there in my email program. As it stands, it sometimes takes me a couple weeks to dig back far enough to find a good reply, and by the time I respond to it, everyone else is done with the topic.<p>

The email wouldn't have to be fancy. Just something like:
<blockquote>
There has been a reply to your posting with the subject "Feature for Discuss"<br>
It is at <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$37523">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$37523</a>
</blockquote><p>

Does it make sense, or am I insane this morning (never want to rule out the possibility)?<p>
