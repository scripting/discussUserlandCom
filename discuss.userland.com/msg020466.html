while there are certainly many interesting things to read at this site, the filters required are beginning to get in the way. i do read cam most every day, and very much respect his thoughtfulness. this site seems to be more about people than ideas, and discussing ideas does "generally" not require the inclusion of the authors personality.
thanks.
