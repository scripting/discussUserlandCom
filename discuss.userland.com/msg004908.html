I'm certain. In fact it is convenient to see my password listed there so I don't have to check my mail while debugging this.<p>

I guess I'll have to look at the contents of these cookies? I'm using Netscape v4.5. Same thing happens with Explorer 4.5, but at least it's easier to view the cookie there.
