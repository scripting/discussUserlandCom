The problem is going the other way.  When Perl sends a 1 as "true" it will get encoded as <i4>1</i4>.  If the server that decodes that message to an int passes it to a function that really does distinguish between booleans and ints (Pascal, anyone?), you'll get a fault.<p>

I think Fredrik's solution, to define True and False objects in the XML RPC library, is a good one.  The client-side programmer can insert those values into the call (perhaps in the stub routine), knowing they will be properly encoded and interpreted on the server.<p>
