The path can be: <br>
"zkm/artists/lintermann" or "zkm/institutes/vismedia/artists/lintermann" or "zkm/projects/lintermann", and so on.<p>

This makes lots of sense, but it's getting tedious if I need to map hundreds of pages to *several* categories. So it would be handy to have a tag like:<p>

<virtualcategorie name="kuenstler" pathname="artists"></virtualcategory> <p>

This would just map a request like "zkm/kuenstler/penny" to "zkm/artists/penny", where "artists" is defined as a <category>-tag.<p>

Or is there a way to do this with shortcuts or another mechanism that I didn't think of?<p>

Thank you in advance for any interesting proposals.
<br>Christoph
