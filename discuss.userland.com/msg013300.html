I will probably (if I get the funding) get involved in establishing a scientific web-forum, where a panel of "sages" will have to comment on the news posted there and those "sages" should be able to do this within their browser environment. If Manila expands on the "edit page in browser" concept, then I believe we have our solution.<p>
