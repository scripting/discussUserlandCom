This response is just pedantic, where I demonstrate how you twist my words.  You falsely attributed to me a "right to survive" rhetoric.  I denied it and said it made me look stupid.  Left unstated was my presumption that you choose your words to make others look foolish.
I did not say "stop treating me like I'm stupid."  I'm not and you haven't been.  But you feel free to put me in the defensive position of protesting again.  Man, it's ugly.  At this point I would normally say something that would get this post bounced for flaming.  (A little name calling.)
