You can get notification when a bus on your route reaches a certain point, but you have to find the bus on the map first, right-click it and choose "bus progress", and then click your location on the progress bar.  How could this work better for you?  <p>

Since we mostly code in java, I'd be tempted to use RMI for the type of server-to-browser notification Eric suggests.  However, we've found it difficult (if not impossible) to make RMI connections work across a firewall.  How does XML-RPC address this?  Are suspicious system administrators really willing to allow incoming text/xml POSTs on any socket?  <p>
