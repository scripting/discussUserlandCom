When I first read this, this afternoon I thought "I'm glad he (Dave) finally wrote this down, its so obvious - but not stated anywhere"<p>

In re-reading it now I'm equally pleased. I was expecting to see lots of people to start complaining that "But I don't use Frontier for that, its more than that..." when I logged back on tonight - I guess I was wrong :-)<p>

I think having a clear statement about your product/ company is a very good thing.<p>

Personally, I've come to think of Frontier as groupware for building websites - But just because Quark is so obviously streamlined for the publishing community (ie mutiple page designs), doesn't mean people don't use it to design posters.<p>

Oh, I could go off on such a tangent on marketing-speak ... Ogilvie is a wise man.
