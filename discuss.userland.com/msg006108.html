I did an interesting test that gave me part of the answer. I sent email from Outlook Express that contained some of our 8-bit
characters, and they were received correctly. Here are the content type and transfer encodings from the header:<p>

Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"<BR>
Content-transfer-encoding: base64<p>

When I sent a message without any 8 bit chars here are the same header fields:<p>

Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"<BR>
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit<p>

I've looked at the TCP verbs, and though you can set mime type, I don't see if an how this encoding can be set. Ideas anyone?<p>

mahalo!<p>
