The reason I ask is because I wanted to add Tomolak's Realm to my my.userland.com profile, but it's two screenfuls high.  I might as well go to his site.<p>

I prefer to just see the links to cut down on scrolling.<p>

<b>My.Netscape.Com User Interface</b>
(the one I use daily)<p>

The reason I still use my.netscape.com daily is because I can get dozens on links on one page, rather than a handful.  Hopefully my.userland.com will eventually offer that capability...<p>

Thanks,<p>
