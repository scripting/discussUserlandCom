MacWEEK is a UserLand customer. <p>

www.macweek.com is managed with Frontier 5.1.4.<p>

So the first thing I want to say is Thanks MacWEEK! for trusting our CMS with their web publication. And I'd also like to thank Bob Bierman and Phil Suh, who was a contractor for UserLand, for guiding the project thru to completion.<p>

I also wanted to open this thread in case anyone has questions for Phil and Bob about the site. <p>

And one more time, thanks MacWEEK for trusting us. After all these years in the Mac business, it's very gratifying to have Frontier play a new role in streamlining the flow of news to Macintosh system managers and users. So welcome to MacWEEK as a UserLand customer, we look forward to doing great things together in the future.<p>

Onward!
