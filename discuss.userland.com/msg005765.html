While it sounds good in theory that we can protect ourselves from a despotic government, how would those weapons stand up against the US Military.  <p>

Wouldn't a more successful method of protecting our democracy be to make sure more people participate in it?<p>

Can you envision any single power center being able to control the military in our system, considering the checks and balances currently in place, especially where the military itself is basically non-political?  I think the time to worry is when they stop teaching recruits the proper role of the military relative to the civilian government.
