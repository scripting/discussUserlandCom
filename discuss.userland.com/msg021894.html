This is just a reminder to me and anyone else who's going to be at the <a href="http://www.builder.com/Conference00/?tag=st.bl.3880.srch.Conference00">Builder.Com</a> or <a href="http://www.edevcon.com/2000/default.asp">Fawcette</a> conferences, I'm speaking three times. Giving a 1.5 hour keynote on SOAP and XML-RPC. I love New Orleans, so many cool <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=new+orleans+restaurants">places to eat</a>. Maybe this time we'll have a dinner at an moderately expensive restaurant. It pays to plan this one ahead, reservations might be tricky. Brent</a> is coming too.<br><br><a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/dinnerInNewOrleans">Survey</a>: I want to have a Scripting News dinner in New Orleans in early December, to concide with the Builder.Com and Fawcette conferences.

Another unexplored mode for music on the Net.<br><br>Yesterday Jake spent a half-day looking into <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a>, to see what it would take to implement it in Radio UserLand. To my surprise, Jabber appears <i>not</i> to be P2P. There's a central server that's doing all the message routing. This post is a reality-check. If this is not true, please send me email.<br><br><a href="http://mailpages.scripting.com/2000/11/03">Mail Starting 11/03/00</a> is about Jabber. <br><br>The redesign of the "XML-RPC" site is done. The theme is slightly different from the other new UserLand sites. We didn't put the cactus in this one. We also decided not to make the theme about space or the moon. An earlier version had an American flag, which I vetoed (most of the XML-RPC implementations are from Europe). We went for a different background, a picture of the United Nations, and where the cactus would appear, a dove with an olive branch. Might as well get the politics right as we add the glitz and glamor.<br><br>BTW, XML-RPC is totally P2P. <i>That rhymes!</i><br><br><a href="http://zopefish.weblogs.com/2000/10/24">David Brown</a>: "I found out last night that a good friend of mine had died in his sleep last Saturday.

If so we can get a transcript of a chat session to flow through our CMS, I'd link it up to a single copy of Radio UserLand in an outline so it could be massaged into a document.<br><br><b>Who's pointing to me?<a name="whosPointingToMe">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/03#whosPointingToMe" title="Permanent link to 'Who's pointing to me?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	We have a new feature today for all Manila sites, UserLand-hosted or otherwise.<br><br>	We call this feature <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$4580">Referers</a>. We mis-spelled it the same way the browser guys did. If you run a Manila site, ever wonder how people found their way to you? Well, now you can tell. In the stats section of your site there's a new page called referers that ranks the referer links for the last 24 hours. The page is re-built no more than once an hour. <br><br>	Here's a <a href="http://dave.editthispage.com/stats/referers">link</a> to the referers page on my personal ETP site. It's always interesting to see how the search engines get people to your site. Some more. <a href="http://themes.editthispage.com/stats/referers">MattyG</a>, <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/stats/referers">XML-RPC.Com</a>, <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/stats/referers">Weblogs.Com</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/zopeNewbies/stats/referers">ZopeNewbies</a>, <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/stats/referers">Doc Searls</a>, <a href="http://adamcurry.editthispage.com/stats/referers">Adam Curry</a>.<br><br><b>Who's helping Manila?<a name="whosHelpingManila">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/03#whosHelpingManila" title="Permanent link to 'Who's helping Manila?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I did a re-order of the "exit links" in the left column on Scripting News, favoring sites that include the Manila badge. We have a Web app that ranks such sites.<br><br>	It's easy to include the badge in your site. If your site is on a UserLand server, just include the words "This is a Manila Site" in double-quotes in your template. If your Manila site is not on a UserLand server, no problemmo, just include this script tag.<br><br>	<script language="JavaScript" src="http://badges.userland.com/manila"></script><br><br>
