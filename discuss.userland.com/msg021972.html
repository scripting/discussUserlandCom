<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov 8 (Reuters) - As the world waited on Wednesday for the state of Florida to recount its ballots in the ultra-close U.S. presidential race, many big Internet news sites failed to stand up to the crush of visitors, sometimes even posting tallies that were nearly a day old.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>One Internet user got an afternoon "update" on CNN.com (</FONT></SPAN><A href="http://www.cnn.com/"><FONT face=Arial size=2><a href="http://www.cnn.com">http://www.cnn.com</a></FONT></A><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>) listing only 23 of the 50 U.S. states -- a long-outdated scored card that had Gore ahead by a narrow electoral count of 12 to 11.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>MSNBC.com similarly offered some visitors an electoral vote count showing Bush with 144 and Gore with 160 at a time when both candidates had more than 240 and only Florida's 25 hanging in the balance.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>And even on sites that were able to keep the news pretty current, delays of up to a minute getting onto a desired page were not uncommon.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>"We actually thought we had prepared enough, but obviously we didn't," said John Nicol, general manager of MSNBC.com, jointly operated by Microsoft Corp </FONT></SPAN><A href="http://www2.marketwatch.com/quotes/quotes.asp?symb=MSFT&amp;source=htx/http2_mw"><FONT face=Arial size=2>MSFT</FONT></A><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2> and General Electric Co's </FONT></SPAN><A href="http://www2.marketwatch.com/quotes/quotes.asp?symb=GE&amp;source=htx/http2_mw"><FONT face=Arial size=2>GE</FONT></A><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2> NBC television network.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>Nicol said the MSNBC site never crashed but was often slow to load pages and update them.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>MSNBC, which like the state of Florida, was still counting all its visitors from the past two days, said it appeared that Tuesday's traffic to its site totaled around 6 million unique visitors, about double the old record set in July when a Concorde jet crashed outside of Paris.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>And, it said early indications were that Wednesday's traffic would be double Tuesday's record levels.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>In anticipation of heavy traffic, MSNBC had doubled the number of computer servers it had supporting the site, and "lightened" some of the pages to remove advertisements and other graphics to help pages load more quickly.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>Keynote Systems Inc. </FONT></SPAN><A href="http://www2.marketwatch.com/quotes/quotes.asp?symb=KEYN&amp;source=htx/http2_mw"><FONT face=Arial size=2>KEYN</FONT></A><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>, a Silicon Valley company that tracks different Web sites' performance, reported an overall deterioration by early Wednesday morning.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>It said the New York Times Web site (</FONT></SPAN><A href="http://www.nytimes.com/"><FONT face=Arial size=2><a href="http://www.nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com</a></FONT></A><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>) was showing a "terrible performance" with pages taking close to two minutes to load at some points, and USA Today's (</FONT></SPAN><A href="http://www.usatoday.com/"><FONT face=Arial size=2><a href="http://www.usatoday.com">http://www.usatoday.com</a></FONT></A><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>) site got slower as the uncertainty over the election continued.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>Web sites have traditionally limped during peak news events like the death of Princess Diana and the release of the Starr Report detailing President Clinton's affair with a White House intern.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>Still the continued failure of so many top Web sites to perform as consistently as old media sources like television or radio raises questions about whether they will ever be able to reach such a level of reliability.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>MSNBC emphasized the strides that had been made since the last presidential election, when most big news sites crashed for a good part in the day. But it said it was constantly having to upgrade its technology to meet growing traffic.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>One Web site that performed better was ABCNews.com (</FONT></SPAN><A href="http://www.abcnews.com/"><FONT face=Arial size=2><a href="http://www.abcnews.com">http://www.abcnews.com</a></FONT></A><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>), which continued to load pages in under three seconds as its election day audience tripled the old record number of visitors.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>But ABCNews was careful not to gloat, saying it faced bigger challenges going forward, as even more people used the Internet for election updates, and demand for news over wireless devices grew from a now minuscule number in the tens of thousands.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=para><SPAN class=para><FONT face=Arial size=2>"I have to say there but for the grace of God go I," said ABCNews.com general manager Bernard Gershon, referring to some other rival sites that were left limping. "I'd like to pat myself on the back and say we have the best team out there. We were prepared, but we were also lucky."</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>
