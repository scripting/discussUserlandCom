Nobody will even ask for something to be a part of the Windows install until that something (in this case a really useful runtime) actually exists.<p>

The good news is, this matters less and less as the internet becomes more pervasive and the expectable bandwidth goes up.  IE 5 is chock full of components that don't have be installed initially and will Just In Time (JIT) download when a page needs them.<p>

Various other Windows components (like the Windows Media Player) are starting to do this also.  I actually have no clue if this is or is not a standardized service that can be built-in to any app or every developer is going to have to write this from scratch.  Either way you can bet that MFC, WFC et al will have a nice wrapper pretty quickly.<p>

But I digress<p>
