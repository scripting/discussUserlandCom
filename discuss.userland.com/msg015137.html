I unfortunately had to delete his message because it was in response to a very abusive flame. <p>

In any case, I wanted to tell Karl and others that we *do* indeed delete messages on other sites, if they are off-topic, or personal, or abusive. That's the only way to prevent a public site from becoming a lowest-common-denominator cesspool. You have to take out the garbage so people get the message and stop posting it.
