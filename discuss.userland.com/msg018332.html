"180 different keys" adds about as much difficulty as simply adding 8 bits to a single encryption key. And that's if they're fully independent, which they're not--you have to be generating that one key a second through some kind of math on both ends, which might be exploitable. So as an encryption algorithm, it's almost certainly less secure than standard algorithms. All of which, as others have pointed out, is moot, because as long as the user is able to decrypt and listen to the plaintext, the system can be broken.
