It is the what a willing buyer with complete information about the market will pay a willing seller for a product or service. This value can be stated in terms other than monetary units -- for example, one cow can have a market value of ten chickens. However, it certainly should be well defined.
<P>
"Compliance with the GPL" cannot be considered to be the "market value" of anything because it entails a potentially infinite loss on the part of the programmer. This is the same reason why the GPL is probably not enforceable: it is a contract to make a potentially infinite number of other contracts.
