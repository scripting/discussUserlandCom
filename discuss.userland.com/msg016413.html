Anyone care to help me with ideas?<p>

I'm comfortable with my machines right now, and we have a very fine internet connection.<p>

I'm thinking in the direction of hardware, particularly 2-way H.323 desktop video.  <a href="http://www.vcon.com/">VCON</a> is getting <b>highly</b> recommended to me right now.  I'd also like a digital camera or two.  Is the Nikon Coolpix the way to go?<p>

I'm up to date on most of my key software (i.e. don't suggest the following):<p>

Photoshop (LE)<br>
Flash<br>
Dreamweaver (3) coursebuilder<br>
Frontier (naturally - can't live without it)<br>
Acrobat<br>
Toolbook Assistant<br>
Designers Edge<br>
MS Office 2000<br><p>

Is there something obvious I'm missing?<p>

Thanks<p>

David
