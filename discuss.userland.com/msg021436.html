"InfoWorld"  - <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/00/09/14/000914hnwap.xml">WAP Forum moves toward Net standards</a>.
	<p>The WAP Forum expects to approve Version 2.0 of WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) by mid-2001 and may complete specifications before that for features such as animation, streaming media, and downloading of music files, leaders of the group said at a press event Thursday following a two-day meeting here.</p>
	<p>The next major version of WAP, a protocol for providing Internet-based data services on mobile phones, will complete a migration to XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) as the foundation of the technology, which will make it easier for developers to write WAP applications, said Michael Short, director of international affairs and strategy at BTCellnet, in Slough, England, and a member of the WAP Forum board of directors.</p><p>
