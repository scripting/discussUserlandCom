I'm curious as to why the article text focuses on webMethods and Microsoft's BizTalk, neither of which (as far as I know) adhere to your XML-RPC specification, and yet the sidebar of links has entries for www.xmlrpc.com and Frontier.<p>

This might end up being a problem if industry periodicals use "XML RPC" to describe a range of incompatible schemes, and perhaps not giving the actual spec the appropriate amount of ink (or pixels, rather ;-) .<p>

Of course, I could just be fretting about nothing....
