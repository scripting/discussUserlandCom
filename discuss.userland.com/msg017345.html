WO has been Java-driven as well as Objective-C-driven for years now.  They had a "Java Bridge" that allowed you to instanciate and (seamlessly) use Obj-C (OpenStep Foundation/EOF/WO) objects from Java.<p>

The version 5 annoncement is that the whole of WO is being written in Java, and thus it will be Java only.<p>

Apparently 4.5 will be supported for quite some time, however.
