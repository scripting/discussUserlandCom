I get a small amt for that, which, if I'm making compelling enough content, pays for my monthly subscription fee.<p>

If I lapse in my fee, dont take down the site if others are using the content, just disallow the admin access, for some set time.<p>

I have mindspring auto charge me per month for internet access. Manila should be able to do the same.<p>

Any chance of some kind of marketplace for content or for services?
Say I know manila really well, I might become a contributing member to say 4 other sites and be able to get a small fee for that...<p>

In terms of raw cost per month - perhaps it should be some percentage of the cost of buying it outright.  <p>

Hahah! Rent to own Manila! If I pay my subscription for 1 year I get a full copy of manila :)
