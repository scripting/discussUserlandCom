The market will never be destroyed.  Margins and demand may fall or rise, but there's <b>always</b> going to be a market.  People are always going to need custom software.  People are always going to need help in customizing pre-built software.  People will always need developers.<p>

There's more to development than pre-built software, and I doubt the GPL can even destroy that.
