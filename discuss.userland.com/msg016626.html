I'm confused about what I am reading.<p>

The open source community is a natural ally for the patent fight you are instigating.  There's been lots of cooperation with O'Reilly and affiliates, like the content flows and weblogs.<p>

Is there some way to bring the anger you are expressing over the skirmishes of a couple years ago re: commercial vs. free to completion?  It looks to me like it is getting in the way of some good budding relationships.<p>

I do not know Raymond or O'Reilly, but I certainly appreciate their work and that they passionately advocate for what they believe in (also one of the reasons I enjoy working with you.)  Dismissing them as non programmers does not make your ideas more persuasive.  Remember how you felt about being called an old hippie?<p>

I appreciate that you risk alot by making your internal processing public.  You are clearly on the horns of a major dilemma (or opportunity??). Let me know how I can support you.<p>

BTW, I will be having some minor surgery tomorrow and may be out of it for a day or two.
