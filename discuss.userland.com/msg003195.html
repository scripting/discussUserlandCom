Also if you're participating in the IEAK5 beta you can download the
latest releases of IE5 (later releases than the version available for
downloading from the public site) from a password protected site (but i don't think i can give you the passwords :(. I don't know if this
should be prevented by the Blue Mountain Arts thing but its available now.
