These are not new problems, but the tactics are becoming better understand. <p>

Option (a). If I'm NBC News, with an audience of 10 million at any given moment, I don't let all 10 million dilute my conversation. I moderate and broadcast so I have a clear editorial voice. High signal to noise ration and no oppty for chaotic behavior by contibutors. This is like DaveNet. <p>

The alternatives are (b) allowing a select few trusted contributors participate and letting everyone else lurk, or (c) opening wide for all comers with a few folks shepperding strays back on topic and educating newbies. With the registration process, Discuss seems somewhere between (b) and (c). <p>

With the few readers and participants Discuss has been delightful. What happens when you have a 1000 fold increase in the number of participants? <p>

David Bernbaum did an inquisitive piece on the taxonomy of list publishing styles in last April's Wired magazine at <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.04/es_lists_pr.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.04/es_lists_pr.html</a>.
