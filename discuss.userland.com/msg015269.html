Anything simple we can do to fight that misuse should be considered. <p>

So I started to change my ETP site (<a href="http://jonasbeckman.editthispage.com">http://jonasbeckman.editthispage.com</a>) at once... but paused when I realized the NoAmazon site is anonymous. They say they are not affiliated with any company - but that's it.<p>

Don't get me wrong - I want to support this. I just wonder who I would be fighting with. Does anyone know?
