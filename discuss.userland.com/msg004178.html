I've created two different channels and both times I received the same error you did. By backing out and starting the process over, I was able to get their RSS server to OK the file.<p>

One other person has reported this same problem, so I doubt it's a problem with our files. I'm guessing it's an issue on their end.<p>

Also understand that their server only does indexing queries on the hour. So, if you make a change to your file on your server you have to wait until their server runs the indexing cycle again before the changes will show up.<p>
