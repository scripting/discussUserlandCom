Recently I've had to do a lot of third-party site wrapping in Java, i.e. be an HTTP client and extract some information from a site for further use.<p>

Thanks to some pretty spiffy tools, here's a Java function to compute the shipping cost for UPS service to a residential address in the United States, assuming that you provide your own packaging:<p>

public static double getShippingCost(String method, int srcZip, String destCity, int destZip, int weight) throws WeaselAppException<br>
&#123;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;StringBuffer query = new StringBuffer ("http://www.ups.com/using/services/rave/qcosthtm.cgi?accept_UPS_license_agreement=yes&10_action=3&14_origCountry=US&22_destCountry=US&47_rate_chart=One+Time+Pickup&48_container=00&49_residential=Yes&");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;double  result = 0.0;<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;query.append("13_product=" + method + "&");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;query.append("15_origPostal=" + new Integer(srcZip).toString() + "&");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;query.append("20_destCity=" + URLEncoder.encode(destCity) + "&");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;query.append("19_destPostal=" + new Integer(destZip).toString() + "&");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;query.append("23_weight=" + new Integer(weight).toString());<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Path path = Pwd.lookup(query.toString());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Document doc;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Node node;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;try<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#123;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doc = LooseHtml.parseFile(path);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;catch (IOException ex)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#123;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw new WeaselAppException(ex.getMessage());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;try<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#123;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;node = XPath.find("//text()[contains(., \"TOTAL RATE:")]/ancestor::td/following-sibling::td/text()", doc);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;catch (XPathParseException ex)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#123;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw new WeaselAppException(ex.getMessage());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;String resultString = node.getNodeValue().substring(1, node.getNodeValue().length());   <a href="//">//</a> Drop leading $<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;result = Double.valueOf(resultString).doubleValue();<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br>
&#125;<p>

It's just a few lines, and the only interesting ones are the Pwd.lookup, LooseHtml.parseFile, and XPath.find ones, because they implement opening an HTTP stream, parsing HTML into a DOM-compliant structure, and doing an XPath query, respectively. The rest is just parameterization and exception handling.<p>

The assumption about the page that comes back is that there's a text element somewhere that contains "TOTAL RATE:", that there's a <TD> above it, that the <TD> has a following <TD> at the same level, and that the text element in within that <TD> contains a $ followed by a string that can be converted to a double.<p>

It took me a lot longer to write this message than it took to write the above code. I can't think of any better explanation as to why "XML" is cool, but I put "XML" in quotes because XML per se didn't make the above code that easy to write; the ready availability of XML/HTML parsers, DOM implementations, and XPath implementations did. Incidentally, the above code was written using Resin, from <<a href="http://www.caucho.com">http://www.caucho.com</a>>, as the XML/HTML/DOM/XPath implementation. As I've posted here before, you could do something extremely similar using Frontier by "importing" the HTML into a table and using UserTalk's ODB navigation commands to search for/extract the desired information.<p>

XML is cool because there are so many big brains who think it's cool enough to write cool tools for. No better reason, no worse reason.
