History suggests that you can't have a half geek, half non-geek magazine for ever, but you can keep it up for quite a long time.</I></B><p>

<I>That's true, with Byte as the most obvious case in point. But I'd like us to try. If we succeed, there are all kinds of ways we can take it.</I><p>

Oh, as a reader of geek magazines, I could give you all sorts of examples. Even things like the <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/cacm/0599/0599toc.html"><I>Communications of the ACM</I></A> tend to get fluffy over time.<p>

I think it's mostly a matter of demographics and advertisers. Programmers and non-programmers are very different groups, and there's a lot more non-programmers. So a little bit of demographic research will tell you that's there's more money if you appeal to the non-programmers.<p>

But in the short term, the Linux community is supersaturated with inquistitive geeks and top-notch hackers. O'Reilly does quite well by targeting this group of people. I figure that the LJ will be able to persue a split strategy for several years, at least.<p>

In the long run, I'd like to see both sorts of Linux publications: a good, glossy end-user magazine, and super-geeky journal for interesting hacks.<p>

<I>I do believe this is also the idea at SSC. If it can be done, even if in a clunky way, at least try to do it. Going with Mac or PC clients would be too easy.</I><p>

With that attitude, we'll make a Linux hacker out of you yet. ;-) Have you ever spent a day pounding version 0.10 of some software package into submission just for sheer kicks?[1] If so, the condition's chronic.<p>

Cheers, Eric<p>
