"Wow, I just noticed that I got linked to on The Scripting News somehow, and that is why I have been getting so many hits all of a sudden.

<a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.searchenable.com/sb/developers.html#manila">Want to know how</a> you can integrate a 1.5 million site web directory into your Manila site for free?<p>

BTW, we recommend using their second method for integrating with Manila. Make <script> a legal tag for your site, if you haven't already done so. This method of integration is becoming commonplace, and that's a good thing. We use the same method for the Weblog banner ads. How different our world would have been if HTML had an <include> <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/12/18/TheKillerTag#theKillerTagItself">tag</a> from the beginning?<p>

Another <a href="http://www.wrongwaygoback.com/articleone/tired.shtml">parody</a> of self-importance in the Weblog world. "Graham believed he could simply slut his way to the greatest number of links. This proved impossible, as Williams and Winer had an unnatural obsession with linkage, and Graham simply couldn't fulfil their needs." <i>Funny!</i><p>

MSNBC: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/373726.asp">No sex, please. We’re NASA</a>. "While NASA officials don’t categorically state that there has never been any sexual activity in space, they have consistently drawn a veil over public discussion of such questions." <i>I always wondered about this.</i><p>

Little-known fact: If you want to make your server compatible with ours, read this <a href="http://static.userland.com/shortcuts/glossary.xml">XML file</a> every hour and if it changed, copy it into your database. It's pretty straightforward to do, and obviously works with content management systems other than UserLand's (because it's XML, of course).<p>

A little-known shortcuts-related <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$283">feature</a> on Weblogs.Com.<p>
