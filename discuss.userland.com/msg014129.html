Subject: [Re: Those "free" Vans shoes]<p>

My fiance, Josie, woke up yesterday morning from a dream where she
realized she should check out the vans.com site (she's like that).
There she found a product in their catalog with a purchase price of
$0.00.  She promptly placed an order for a pair and told a number of
friends, who also placed orders.  The Vans company caught the mistake
(probably during fulfillment), claiming Y2K issues were involved.  In
a very humorous customer-service email enclosed below, they chose to
award her a free pair of shoes, although they denied all the friend's
orders.  The email trail is below.<p>

Feel free to use this anecdote if you need a Y2K/E-commerce story for
a client :)<p>

Dear Josie: Congratulations on your alertness in discovering our Y2K
glitch, and thanks for your alacrity and marketing acumen in notifying
your friends Heather, Gina, Joe, Philip, Elizabeth, and Allison in a
generous attempt to spread your good fortune.  For your efforts we
have decided to send you the Red/red cyber print Old Skools that you
ordered, for just the shipping fee of $6.95 that was charged to your
card.  However, please convey our condolences to your six Bay-area
friends, as they will have to go back online and re-order (and pay the
current, corrected price) for their shoes in order for their orders to
be processed.  Happy Millennium!<p>

Richard Mooney, shop.vans guy.<p>
