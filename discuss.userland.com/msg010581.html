It's very impressive. It was also nice to see that the same software runs on Linux (Intel and MIPS) and NT, in my case. <p>

Zope plus Squishdot is very fast on my home machine (Linux Celeron 400), office NT server (PIII-500), and office Qube2. It's a bit sluggish on my personal Qube. The Qube2's performance is comparable to the two Intel machines. The Qube2 has 128 MB of RAM, a faster CPU, and a much faster hdd than the Qube (64 MB of RAM). All the fast machines have 128 MB of RAM. The Qube is limited to 64 MB of RAM.<p>

Documentation, however, is a sore point. I got everything working by playing with it. (Here I'm talking about Zope plus Squishdot, not Zope alone.)
