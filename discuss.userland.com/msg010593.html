And it is subject to preferences when it renders. I was just thinking tonight of doing a page where you can design your own template for browsing the DG and the news. <p>

We already have a better way, by the way, thru XML-RPC you can get the contents of the DG and render it locally any way you want. And your favorite scripting language, Tcl, already works with our servers.<p>

We had a slogan at Living Videotext. "Let the users design the software." And then on starting UserLand we extended that to "Let them implement it too."<p>

This is one of those times when a little knowedge on your side could be totally dangerous!
