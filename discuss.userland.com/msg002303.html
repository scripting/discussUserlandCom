Here's my proposal:<p>

1) simply add the relevant parts of your response to
Mr. Nitpicker to the official specification <i>as a
requirement</i>.  XML RPC implementations must be strict
in what they write -- if a value doesn't have a valid
syntax, the implementation is broken.<p>

2) in the spirit of XML, recommend that both clients
and servers simply refuse to deal with malformed packages.<p>

3) don't define any conversions at all in the protocol;
if a method can accept either a <string> or a <base64>
chunk, or a <boolean> instead of an <int>, it's up to
the server implementor to define that.<p>

I think most other solutions would reduce interoperability
rather than improve it...
