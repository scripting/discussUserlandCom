Don't forget, Napster's server contain VERY valuable information: they know exactly what's popular, they know what people are looking for, and they know what's out there.  There's no equivalent to this information gem anywhere before, ever.  All the information from everyone's searches and requests are sitting in a database in napster's servers.  All they have to do is mine it.  That alone could keep napster in business.
