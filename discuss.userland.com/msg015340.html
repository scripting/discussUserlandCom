This only answers your question obliquely.<p>

I know how to use ASP the other way, so that an ASP page includes a Frontier served page. I use an activeX object called ASPHttp to extract pages from another server; I then call server-side javascript to extract the relevant portions and include it in my ASP page. Sample code is included with the evaluation version of asphttp.<p>

PS: I am only a satisfied user of ASPHTTP and am not connected to them in any other way.
