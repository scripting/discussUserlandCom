I can't track it down right now, but it was a tongue-in-cheek article about the Cheney selection.  Powell said he didn't want to campaign, and Cheney has those health issues.<p>

Summary, as I remember it:<p>

Cheney would do the grunt work of campaigning, then would be hit with a health crisis [and who would look askance at the man for dropping out with a bad heart].  Then, close to the election [no substantive campaigning to do...], who would be there to fill his shoes?  Why, Colin Powell.  America loves Colin Powell.  He's stepping up when his party and country need him [again].  He's got charisma.  It would be the Democrat's worst nightmare.<p>

Now, if only I could find the original article... ;)
