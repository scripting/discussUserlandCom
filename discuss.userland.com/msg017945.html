Just a very hard question.<p>

It's clear the record companies do musicians wrong on a million different levels.  I don't disagree with those numbers.  I'm very happy Napster has come along to really rip things up and make the record companies take notice - they aren't in control anymore.<p>

But I don't think that can be used as an excuse for Napster to do the same thing as the record companies do, which is route around the artist.<p>

I don't think musicians should have less rights then authors of books and software.  I think songs have just as much value in my life as any book I've ever read.  In fact, I probably owe my life to a few.  <p>

Dave, if people started distributing your software, that you put your blood, sweat and tears into, without your permission - you'd probably shut them down.  And I wouldn't blame you.<p>

Musicians deserve that same basic right.  They have families to feed as well.<p>

I take it you're not going to ask this question ehh?
