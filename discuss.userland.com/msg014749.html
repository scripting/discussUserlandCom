A Geocities. A FrontPage. A Spectra. A TalkCity. A BigStep. <p>

Of all the issues that underpine the cool things going on in UserLand, trust is the mortar. <p>

Trust makes things work. <p>

<em>We trust UserLand (and others) will remain solvent</em> so its products and services persist. (Something I've always wanted to see on sites that ask me to leave my content: what is your cash-on-hand divided by monthly-burn-rate.)<p>

<em>We trust services will be up. </em>Always. Back at LSI Logic, I learned that our corporate intranet had become mission critical when an off-hour PM drove our Singapore sales reps nuts because they couldn't go on sales calls without downloading presentations. ETP got that message last week. <p>

<em>We depend on cordial behavior</em> from visitors and site contributors. Failing this, we'll spend fortunes and time editing, policing, securing, bulletproofing; non-productive effort. Distrust turns something elegant into an AOL. <p>

<em>Content contributors expect content holders to respect privacy and intellectual property.</em> For instance... I spend a lot of time on or around job boards because of my employer, an HR conglomerate. There is a strong move to use XML syndication to swap resumes among job boards, recruiters, and potential employers. This commoditizes my biography, test results, references, contact info, objectives, without my permission. see <a href="http://www.hr-xml.org/" target="_xyz">HR-XML.org</a>. <p>

Part of what makes ETP work is the sheer, vast openness of the idea. Someone trusts you to put up a web site. You can say what you want. Do it your way. We trust you. No censors. We're going to treat you like an adult.  <p>

I'd like Davos to hear:
<ul>
<li>Privacy laws, like those in the EC, are vital to the success of the net. Put the ownership of your metadata back in your hands. 
<li>The spirit of citizenship, neighborliness, and intellectual honesty propels use and creates enduring value. While not all people are good, as a working assumption it proves out. 
<li>Censorship is a real barrier to the success of these media. To educate, enrich, and enable your workers, your government, remove the filters. 
</ul>
