The problem with the investment community today is that it places almost no value on technology.<p>

I'm different -- I place a very high value on technology. But we can't for whatever reason, at least at this time, command that kind of valuation. May be getting closer.<p>

Personally, if I ran a big VC fund with a longterm view, I would always be diverting some of the profits into technology investment. <p>

But one thing's for sure, there's a vacuum of good content around Linux, and money *is* chasing it, or at least it was last time I looked (this spring).<p>

And no you're not flaming. I know you Fredrik, well enough to know that.
