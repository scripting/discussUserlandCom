I checked this in O'Reilly's "DNS and Bind", and according to the book, davenet.userland.com is an alias of a *host* in the userland.com domain (nirvana.userland.com)<p>

An example of a host in a subdomain would be money.accounts.userland.com. Here "accounts" is the subdomain, "money" is the host.<p>

I agree with Dave that aliases take effect immediately, but that's because they don't require a reverse DNS entry, since the reverse of an alias is the reverse of the original host.<p>

But if you are using subdomains, then this could well be problem, as Kurt suggests. I agree with Kurt that the previous doctree structure was elegant, but whether it's workable in the context of mainResponder is another question.
