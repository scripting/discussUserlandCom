<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21565">
Anti-Microsoft sentiment</a> topic, so we can discuss
IP (intellectual property) issues without specifically
discussing Microsoft.  (Since Microsoft is just one
player in the landscape, I see no reason to dwell on it.)<p>

Josh Allen: <i>Sorry, I meant ways to redistribute the
power created by IP. You said you do not intend this to
go the same way that capital has; I'd like you to share
some of your ideas about things that might happen in
society to fix the problem, things that should
happen, things that will happen, etc.</i><p>

Okay, and I'm interested in other folks' ideas, too.
But to discuss this we might need to invest some time
in defining more context in the landscape.  Describing
power situations for an activity or piece of technology
is like analyzing a game.  So what is the game layout?<p>

This will be hard because it involves verbalizing a thing
I visualize and model in my mind's eye without having
used many words to think about before.  So I can only
start this by sketching in a milieu in which I want to
place the ideas, like a fiction writer setting a scene.<p>

I intend to imply several things in this post, without
saying many things explicitly.  The most efficient way to
communicate anything is implicitly because human brains
are marvels at providing and finding appropriate context.
This is why folks are quick to infer implicit insults. :-)<p>

(Yes, much of my writing implies at least as much as I
say.  I don't consider this evil or manipulative.  It's
more an unavoidable circumstance I might as well handle
well since I can't banish it.  Writing can even be
more cohesive when implicit resonates with explicit.)<p>

Imagine two economists playing rock-paper-scissors. :-)
Okay, that's silly, but introduces the idea that some
economic interactions require significant game analysis.
(When I played Magic cards years ago, one of my cohorts
was a Stanford econ grad studying game theory.)<p>

Now imagine all those folks in the marketplace trying
to collectively invent a new set of rules to control
what happens to intellectual content in economic terms.
Note the game rules are not fixed.  Rules are always
subject to change according to social consensus.<p>

I'm getting to the hard part, so this might be more
incoherent.  I have three more ideas to convey in this
introduction to the IP context.  The first idea is game
theoretic and easier to explain.  The second is almost
a cliche in the context of software. The last idea is
rather foggy, and almost mystical in its ambiguity.<p>

A common tactical motif in games is the following
consideration.  Can you stop the other player?  Whole
expanses of game play are determined by whether it's
feasible to stop certain actions.  Obviously this idea
is highly relevant in both economic and legal matters.<p>

Capital is different from purely intellectual content
because it's scarce and not trivially easy to replicate.
Game rules for capital cannot possible work unchanged
for the entirely different context of very low scarcity
digital content.  Obviously folks are testing this now.<p>

[I do not advocate that digital content should be free.
I'm just acknowledging that rules must be different.
I don't know what the rules are yet.  I'm making up rules
right now in front of your eyes.  Watch closely. :-)
Actually this prestigitation will take a while yet.]<p>

The last idea is a curvature of space analogy.  Is the
universe open or closed?  What does this imply? In games
of enough complexity, is game play or or closed?  When
you cannot stop other players from doing certain things,
does this make play space more open or more closed?<p>

My intuition is that folks who wish to tightly reign in
control of intellectual content will be unable to do so,
because this tactic in game play can be refuted in the
game we are going to play.  If possible, I will figure
out how the refutation works, and tell other folks.<p>

Also, folks cannot stop me from saying how to refute
certain kinds of play, because this would first require
that they always understand what I am saying.  Working
around obstacles comes very naturally to me.  It's what
I see all the time.  I see how to open closed doors.</a>
