Thanks for the reply to the first part of my question. So as long as all the interaction with a mainResponder site is from the local network we should be able to test/play around with it without having to dial out via our ISDN line...have I understood you correctly?<p>

Can you comment on my second point below;<p>

Another related question I'd like to pose is how do we take the vanilla MTTF ODB and use it at the core of an app we want to develop...there appear to be many hardcoded references to MTTF in it's scripts. How do people generally do this with Userland supplied example apps and retain the ability to take advantage of future UserLand code updates/bug fixes etc? Coming from a C++/Java where we would just use inheritance/subclasses etc and would therefore tranparently (almost!) inherit any fixes/updates we are unclear on how this is achieved with Frontier.<p>

Thanks.
