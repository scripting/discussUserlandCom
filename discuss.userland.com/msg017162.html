This is a cool idea. A first step would have to be built into Frontier, an interface discovery XML-RPC server. You point the API at an XML_RPC server installed in your copy of Frontier and ask it to return a structure describing the interface of that server -- what arguments are expected, etc etc.<p>

Then, a server side component that takes such a structure and a list of DB addresses and implements the dispatch mechanism to call e.g. the fifth address when the fifth method in the structure is called.<p>

Finally, the complementary other side of the coin would be a Frontier piece of code that would take such a structure and implement a client side stub to make calls on the server.<p>

IOW automate both sides of the process.<p>

Comments?
