There are plenty of GUI apps already, and I'd much rather use a new application as a tie-in to a tool I'm already familiar with than to bring up yet another freakin' window. Also, it's easier to script apps that aren't written as GUIs. There's a reason pipes work as well as they do, and there's a reason that any text file can be a shell script if you set the execute bit and put a little bit of info in the first line.<p>

However, it is actually fairly easy to write GUI apps, the problem is choosing the one true way. The simplest way to start is to make your app a module to Tcl and write the UI in Tcl/Tk. Or just use Tk on its own or as bound to numerous other languages. If you have Tcl/Tk installed (most people do), type "wish" (the Tcl/Tk shell), then enter:<p>

    button .quit -text "Quit this app" -exec exit<p>

    pack .quit<p>

And you've just written your first Un*x GUI app. The advantage to this is that it'll then be fairly easy to port to NT or Mac or whatever. Put those two lines in a text file, and add the line:<p>

    #!/usr/bin/wish<p>

to the top of it, do a "chmod  x filename", and bang, you've got a Tcl program that runs from any command line.<p>

There are three other options for APIs to use. Qt just loosened their licensing and become a force. GTK is the API that GIMP uses. Motif (or Lesstif) if that licensey corporate world appeals.
