An apt, and timely, analogy would be with music.  If I release a song for free, am I to expect someone can take my score and lyrics, add a few lines, and begin selling it?  I <i>may</i> choose to allow that (by releasing it under a TrulyFree license), or I <i>may</i> choose to release it only under the conditions that the derived work is free too (<a href="http://opencontent.org/">OpenContent</a> style, derived from the GPL).<p>

What people do "in their house" is generally not my concern.
