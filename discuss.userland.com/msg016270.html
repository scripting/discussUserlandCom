Do you want to continue?<p><p>I'd never seen that before and I paused for a bit before saying No and then examining the link more closely.  I eventually added it anyway, but it was a different experience than I was used to adding a bookmark/favorite. <p><p>I do have to admit that their bookmarking ability is on par or better than all the other solutions I have seen so far.  Still not sure I want advertisers looking through all my bookmarks to figure out what I'm interested in.  ";->" <p><p>One other nice feature is that it apparently trys to understand several e-commerce sites.  When I click on my deepleap link while visiting a book at Amazon (sorry), it automatically grabbed the price and proper title of the book when I added it to my wishlist.  Barnes & Noble almost worked, returned an error in the title and Borders.com was just blank, leaving it for me to type in the title and price for later comparison.  Still, it could turn out to be a very useful feature.<p><p>PS, how many of you went back into that link and turned the status bar back on, just to see what was going on?<p><p>PPS, I have my own domain at home and to figure out who abuses privacy policies, I make up a new email address for every new service that comes along.  I created my deepleap receiver on March 31st, but can't remember who turned me on to it.<p><p>
