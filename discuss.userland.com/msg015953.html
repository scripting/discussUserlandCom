              It's not in really great shape yet, but how about posting that page of docs on that site, and we can all

Would if I could, but I can't.  It appears to be editors only.  I did it on my site, because I wanted to test and make sure it was working right before letting others know about it.<p>

I'll put it out there once there's access.<p>
