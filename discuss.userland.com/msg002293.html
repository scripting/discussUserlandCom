I'm so glad we're doing this, it's an incredible way to learn about other systems, quickly.<p>

The question comes down to this -- is XML-RPC itself a scripting environment? If so, we have to address questions like this. And if so we must take a least-common-denominator approach. If Perl doesn't have a boolean type, perhaps we shouldn't have a boolean type in the common language? If one language doesn't easily coerce an integer into a double then it's not cool for one XML-RPC implementation to do that automatically. This came home to me when the issue of an <i4> being sent across the wire as 2.0 came up. Frontier would never do that. But I could easily imagine that BASIC would. <p>

Another possible view is that XML-RPC is *not* a scripting environment, and therefore shouldn't define coercions, and leave it up to each server writer to explain the behavior of his or her server. Example: "My server won't care if you send me an <i4> with a value of 2.0, or even 2.01902 (it'll do the truncation automatically)."<p>

My own opinion, at this moment, is that we should try for the first approach, to get a rigorous set of rules in place about what coercions will take place. We can make Perl better by including booleans in the wire protocol, clearly Perl must have *some* convention for what a boolean is, right? How could you program without booleans? So if the language doesn't have support for boolean, we could simply say when Perl gets a <boolean> true it is always turned into a 1 and a false is always 0.
