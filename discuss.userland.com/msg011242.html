While this is interesting in itself, it ain't half as interesting as being a directory of syndication flow *between* XML content resources.<p>

I need to think about this (it's late here), but I would guess that establishing who is doing what with who's XML data (i.e. mapping the syndication flow) would be at least an order of magnitude harder.<p>

This is because it's about discovering relationships, instead of the mere existence of XML data / application interfaces.  The only thing I can think of is asking people to register on xmlTree when they discover and start to syndicate XML content from others.<p>

p.s. I am thinking of overhauling xmlTree so that the parameters etc. for XML-RPC interfaces can be better represented.  It's not the same as interface introspection (discussed at <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$56">http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$56</a> and <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$40">http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$40</a>), but it would be crawlable by robot).
