Yes, Guy's site is really smart. I spoke to him a while back about this kind of effect for live applications, but I don't think there was anything at the time (pointers?).<p>

It would be even better if you could do this and not have to worry about it breaking on different browsers....on that point, anybody know where I could find out about the similarities between IE5 and NS5 (coming)? I want the best possible app to work on both (XML etc..).<p>

Thanks,
Steven
