Wouldn't that mean that they would either need your permission to get the patent, or that you would be one of the holders of the patent, should it be issued?<p>

Seems to me that you should be able to deny the patent application, or if that's not possible, you should be able to license it to whomever you see fit, for free.<p>

Of course, I Am Not A Lawyer, and this post certainly illustrates my lack of comprehension of patent law in the United States.<p>
