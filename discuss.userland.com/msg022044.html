It should be easy for me to read too! Very easy. Second, the idea of the desktop web site is that we can push things to my ever-more-powerful desktop."

I started the site because I read I could and because I wanted to see the software and because of the enthusiasm with which you wrote about it.  No plan in my head other than 'looks cool – must touch.'  A year later I’m still getting up way before the sun so I can tend to it. You the man!

Yesterday when I pointed to my <a href="http://www.superopendirectory.com/directory/4/software/webApplications/dictionaries">list of dictionaries</a> I got a half-dozen great <a href="http://www.superopendirectory.com/directory/4/software/webApplications/dictionaries?command=suggestALink">suggestions</a> and added almost all of them to the category. <br><br>	This is the "timeless weblog" concept I was talking about a few months ago. The resource is persistent, it doesn't scroll off. In my world dictionaries are important resources so they're near the top of the <a href="http://www.superopendirectory.com/">tree</a>. Now if you're looking for a dictionary, think "Dave probably has a good list." And I do, thanks to <i>you.</i><br><br>	I posted a <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/decentralization/1061">brief note</a> about this on the Decentralization list yesterday. People tend to think that P2P applies only to other people's content, but this is a P2P approach to developing a public resource. It's Weblike. And thanks for all your help.<br><br>	And it's open. You can have the "OPML" text of all my directories if you know how to construct a URL to reference the source text. Here's the <a href="http://www.superopendirectory.com/discuss/reader$4.opml">URL</a> for the top directory on SuperOpenDirectory.Com. All you have to know is that the directory is stored in message 4. This technique works for any directory on any Manila site. This is the key to "inclusion" -- the ability to construct directories out of other (people's) directories. It's the equivalent of linking in the outline-oriented Web.<br><br>	<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/directory/1026/xmlEditors">Here's another example</a> of a directory that's growing nicely, based on community participation. <br><br><b>RSS and directories<a name="rssAndDirectories">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/08#rssAndDirectories" title="Permanent link to 'RSS and directories' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'RSS and directories' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	There *is* a method to my madness.<br><br>	Directories and RSS are two sides of the same coin.<br><br>	Here's a <a href="http://www.superopendirectory.com/directory/4/software/operatingSystems/~46~">directory</a> of information for Macintosh developers.<br><br>	Here's a <a href="http://www.thetwowayweb.com/macintoshNews">channel</a> of news about the Macintosh.<br><br>	How long before you see both on the same page?
