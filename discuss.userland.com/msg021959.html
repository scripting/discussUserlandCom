<P>Reason:&nbsp; Consistency. Their <A href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Presidential_Results/">state-by-state results</A>&nbsp;never failed to be the only online source I could find that 1) was always ahead of the TV networks and 2) consistently serving pages.</P>
<P>Technical:&nbsp; While "new media" leaders like Drudge and E-vote could not handle the traffic (this is something online news sources will have to figure out...for a while I just gave up and watched cable TV after several high-profile election sites could not do the job - Channel 34 doesn't care if 1 or 1,000,000 are watching).&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo was also&nbsp;not afraid to gather and display almost immediately <A href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Presidential_Election_2000/">relevant external links</A>&nbsp;to other news outlets.&nbsp; I'm sure other sites also had good real-time results and provided good external links.&nbsp; I didn't see anyone put the package together better than Yahoo. </P>
<P>User interface:&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; No clutter, just the information I wanted.&nbsp; Two clicks from the front page of Yahoo, I could watch the <A href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Presidential_Results/election.html?s=politics/elections/US/pres_florida__all.html">Florida returns</A>&nbsp;as new precincts reported while TV news spun their wheels covering for embarrassing exit poll failures and other online sites (including Florida's own state govt site) crashed.&nbsp;&nbsp; A map was not as easily found, but I can count to 270 and kept up with that well enough through TV outlets.</P>
<P>One final comment:&nbsp;&nbsp;this may be a new medium, but those who have mastered TV news (esp. CNN and ABC) also had some of the better web coverage.&nbsp; Yahoo was one of the few redeeming sites for the web-based outlets.</P>
