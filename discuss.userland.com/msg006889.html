It would be driven by a list of words or phrases that label the topics, and if a topic word or phrase appears in a story, the topic page would be updated. For example, if a new story about (say) Microsoft is added to your weblog, the story gets added to your Microsoft topic page. You could also use this approach to automatically add a "More News about Microsoft" link to the story.<p>

The drawback to this is that if the topic words appear in the story, it'll be linked, regardless of whether it's really relevant. But that's a drawback common to all keyword-based search engines.<p>

Haven't tried this with Frontier's search engine myself, but I'm doing it in a roundabout way for a site under construction (which will be indexing an average of 200 stories per day).
