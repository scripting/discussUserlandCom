There used to be (maybe still is) a SIG (special interest group) of in the Washington D.C. area that gathered to talk about computers and such. Way back when in the mists of time... their main topic was CP/M. Anyway, they migrated to meeting at resteraunts. The discussions were varied. They eventually realized that computers were actually a very small part of their reason for meeting. They were really getting together every month or so for the food and the company. The name of the group was then changed - to <i>The Food SIG</i>.
