<i>Microsoft already did it, in 1995. Win16 to Win32 migration.</i><p>

<i>Be thankful you didn't go to Windows back in '93-'94. It killed a lot of companies. It was a lot more painful than OS to OS X will be.
Apple's offering an easier path than Microsoft offered Win16 programmers when Win95 came out. For Win16 developers, it was a total rewrite, or being stuck with a crappy Win32s app that had no future (and Win32s was no freebee either).</i><p>

This just isn't true. Developers did not have to rewrite their 16-bit apps to be able to run them under Win32. Sure it was attractive to do so, but 16-bit apps run on Microsoft OSs to this day.<p>

Understand that I'm very displeased with Microsoft for many reasons.<p>

But also understand this: Microsoft provided better backward-compatibility during the shift from 16-bit to 32-bit than I've ever seen in personal computers at the time of a major OS change. And they're still providing impressive backward-compatibility as of the Win98 release.<p>

I was working on a huge Windows project at the time that Win95 was imminent (Grolier CD-rom encyclopedia). We ported our code to a separate 32-bit version but we <i>didn't have to.</i> We did it so we could take advantage of the newer Win95 gui components.<p>

The shift from System6 to System7 should have been 1/4 as easy. It would've made me ecstatic.
