Disney sued Sony, and it went all the way to the supreme court.  Fortunately for Disney, Sony won.  Disney started selling all its movies on tape and went on to have its most profitable decade in history.  Disney probably profited more from the VCR than any other single company (as any parent of small children can attest), yet they were precisely the ones that tried to kill the VCR in its infancy.
