The channels are just starting to reveal themselves to me. Ones I had never heard of are sending me to more interesting places. For example about an hour ago I clicked on a link put up by <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$789">a boy and his basement</a>, and it started playing RealAudio jazz, and I really like it. It's been a very nice accompanyment to my work for the last hour. Would I have checked his site? No way. I look at the New Stories page as a diversity machine. It's introducing me to stuff I didn't have in my rotation before. Now your mileage may vary, but I wanted to present a different view from a satisfied customer. Peace..
