I downloaded IE4.5 and took a look at Wes Felter's <a HREF="http://ws3.scripting.com/dhtml">online outline</A>.  Just what I wanted.<p>

Here's the sort of result I'd like to get in Frontier. These were mocked up with Cyberstudio 3.1.  (The CS html for this is huge- if I knew more I'd know if it could be done more economically.)<p>


<a HREF="http://www.123compute.net/dreaming/knocking/knockingOutline.html">a chapter outline</A>. semi-expanded...<p>

Then I'd like to click Frontier outline arrow and get "Knocking..." <a HREF="http://www.123compute.net/dreaming/knocking/knockingParts.html">expanded</A><p>

A tool that could bring the outliner to the Net with some deep and flexible formating options (via a renderOutline script?) would bring Dave's  "ThinkTank" to another level.  I'm thinking here of something that I and a lot of my clients (non-programmers in university, research settings)  could use for simple collaboration-  while we're waiting for the budgets, bandwith, standards, and GUI's that will make the fancier stuff feasible.<p>

So... how far can a Frontier-savvy programmer go with an outline these days?
