The script that parses the ultramode.txt file runs instantaneously on this machine. Click on the Run button and before the mouse is all the way back up the script has completed. This gives a subliminal confidence to my work, a lift that is totally perceivable. Of course in a couple of weeks the lift will be factored in, but while I have it, it gives me a boost of confidence that's quite nice.
