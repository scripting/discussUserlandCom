<a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/">Dan Bricklin</a>: "This morning, Trellix Corporation, the company I founded and for which I am CTO, will announce that we will be offering a browser-based web site publishing tool and a private label hosting service. There will be a smooth integration path for moving sites made with the browser-based tool, called Trellix Web Express, to our client-based Trellix Web. I'm demoing an early version of Trellix Web Express at the Demo 2000 conference this morning." <i>Rock and roll!</i><p>

This is good news for Manila users, and not terrible news for UserLand. Competition will help define a market. The magazines need products to compare. However, the arrival of competition from a fine company like Trellix underscores the need for file-format compatibility, in the age of the web, this is expressed in terms of an XML-RPC interface. We have already specified an interface that allows you to move content in and out of Manila sites. Before you use Trellix's service, be sure they provide a similar interface, even better, one that's compatible with Manila. This would be a good question to ask if it isn't addressed in Dan's demo at Demo.
