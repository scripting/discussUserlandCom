It's just like a Frontier object db table. Can a hash contain other hashes?</i><p>

Sure.  It can also contain arrays, and arrays can contain hashes.  The only real restriction on hashes is that the keys can only be strings (unlike, say, Java Hashtables, in which any object can be the key).<p>

perl datastructuring is at least as powerful as Frontier, but it falls down because you don't have the nice interactive GUI interface onto it.
