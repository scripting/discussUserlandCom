Absolutely. In the case of Apple, hopefully this has changed by force of policy. They seem to be keeping things pretty quiet before release, apart from rough outlines. There hasn't been that much hype of OS X, and YellowBox is not getting any hype, except perhaps obliquely when Apple talks about WebObjects.<p>

Unfortunately, in the case of Apple technologies, a lot of people seem to believe that 'silence == death', and not without some justification.<p>
