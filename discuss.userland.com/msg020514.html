IP as relates to writing became an issue as soon as the printing press achieved widespread use.  Rabbis copying zohar by hand were not in threat of losing their jobs by having their work appropriated and used for profit by others.  In fact, until the advent of the printing press, it was not practical to make a profit from writing, so writing was undertaken for other reasons.  For example, I think that the torah had more to do with cultivating the seeds of Abraham than it did with filling a consumer demand.  Writings used for non-profit purposes tend to be most valuable when they are widest spread.  Judaism was the first deliberately viral thought-construction, and the writings were simply vectors to transmit the thoughts.  In this sense, it is obvious that ecclisiates should be attributed to Solomon.  Mark Twain once said, "People are more likely to believe what you say if you tell them Ben Franklin said it first".  If you are writing something that you want people to buy whether they demand it or not, Solomon is a good source.  I'll conceed that Zohar probably wasn't deliberately viral -- it just survived because the thoughts were so pure and attractive, but that's my opinion :-)
