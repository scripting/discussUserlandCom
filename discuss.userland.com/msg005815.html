In most cases, this is true. Switzerland does control most land access to Italy, but nobody really wants to invade Italy these days. So the land itself has little strategic value.<p>

Any potential invader knows that occupying Switzerland would involve a long, drawn out guerilla war under inhospitible conditions. Combined with the threat of seizing the invader's bank accounts, this fact has kept Switzerland at peace for close to five hundred years.<p>

Battles (whether military, economic or political) rarely accomplish anything. As Sun Tzu points out, it's best to win before you start.
