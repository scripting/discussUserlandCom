Perhaps a simple thing UserLand could do is make it possible to run more than one instance of Frontier on the same machine, and have an external configuration program that could control how each instance can and can't communicate with the others.<p>

That, combined with being able to limit the verb-set in each instance would get pretty far.<p>

You'd also need to be able to tell each instance which IP address to bind to, so that you could do multi-homing, since you couldn't do host-header multi-homing (because you can't have more than one program binding to the same port on the same IP address)<p>

Separating the Frontier engine from the UI would make this much easier... I know, it's been said a thousand times...<p>
