As you know I love DSL.  I have a 384K bi-directional DSL line.  I started with pacific bell internet during their market trial for it back in March but at that time I only had one IP address.  When the market trial ended and they got the option for multiple IP addresses they wanted too much money for additional IP's.  I've since switched to concentric as the ISP (in both cases my actual DSL service is through pacific bell.  I have 16 static IP address (cost $25/year).<p>

It took about two weeks to get my service.  It took about 4 weeks to switch ISP's.<p>

Generally concentric has been responsive once all the paperwork went through.  I did have a little problem when I was setting up domain names, but a little moving up the ladder worked.  (This is an area where concentric is expensive.  They have a one time charge of $100 per domain name, but they give you access to name surfer which allows you to control your third level domain names yourself).<p>

It is fast, and 24x7.  Every so often my connection drops and then resets itself but I am on the outer limits as far as DSL distance to the central office.<p>

All I had to do is plug the modem's 10BaseT port into my network hub and it was on the LAN (I did need a crossover cable).
