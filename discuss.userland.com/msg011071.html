Yes, you can tell, but it normally doesn't help you a whole lot, since it's typically only the destination port that's important. The source port is also different for each connection that you make.<p>

Hmmm...   How about hitting a frontier server that has a /echo responder running? Try <a href="http://209.245.177.3/echo">http://209.245.177.3/echo</a> . That will tell you what headers you're sending out (suitable modified by my proxy server :). Post the results or email them to me.  <p>
