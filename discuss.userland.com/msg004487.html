If you are running NT Server it lets you install IIS, and if you are running Workstation or Win98 you can install PWS.<p>

PWS works ok I guess; it has the user limit, and doesn't have all of IIS's capabilities. Unless you need to run Active Server Pages, I just wouldn't bother though, it's faster to install Xitami if you want something fast and powerful that you can install in a few minutes, or alternately Apache if you want every last bell and whistle...
