<b>QUESTION: </b><p>

<i>What is XML-RPC?</i><p>

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Calls. Procedures are events which occur inside your computer in response to your actions. A procedure call, to summarize, is the name of a procedure, its parameters, and the result it returns. So for example when you ask Frontier to run a script and you get its result, you use a procedure call.<p>

Now, if Frontier is running on another machine that you access thru the Internet (i.e. a remote machine), you'd use a Remote Procedure Call. It's almost the same, except for two points: <ol>
<li>the call has to be transmitted across the Internet</li>
<li>the procedure may run on a platform different than the one you're using</li></ol><p>

So the remote procedure calls must be encoded in a cross platform compatible way. Among the numerous formats allowing this, Userland chose XML.<p>

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. Its main advantage is that it can be read and understood by computers running on any platform, but also by humans.<p>

<b>QUESTION: </b><p>

<i>How to get started with XML-RPC?</i><p>

Since XML is used to encode the data and to decode it at the other end of the connection, you may see it simply as a transfer format. In fact, you don't even have to care about it, because Frontier will do it for you transparently. So if you have two versions of Frontier, one running as a server on the Internet and the other one at your home, you can very easily transfer objects between them.<p>

<i>How to go further?</i><p>

Searching for XML-RPC on the UserLand sites would return you a large number of pages. Here is a selection of the most useful ones:<ul><p>

<li><a href="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/98/07/xmlRpcForGeeks.html">XML-RPC for Geeks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/betty/stories/rpcSecurity.html">Security for RPC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/rpc.html"> XML-RPC Specifications</a>
<li>For a list of about 370 other pages on the subject, <a href="http://search.userland.com/default?m=25&s=1&q=XML-RPC">click here</a></li>
</ul><p>


Also, there was a lot of discussions about XML-RPC on the Script Meridian Community list. Thanks to Jim Roepcke, these discussions are archived and may be browsed on the Web. Start <a href="http://www.roepcke.com/xmlrpc/">from this page.</a>.<p>

And finally, if you need a RPC Debugger, UserLand made one:<ul><p>
