Java applets and applications run under MRJ are now scriptable down to the individual classes within the Java code <i>without the developer having to do anything.</i><p>

The appropriate AppleEvent terminology is generated automatically by the Java runtime, allowing scripting environments to call methods, manipulate variables, and interact with user interface elements in Java code running on the Mac. In a very real sense, most of the classes available to Java applications are now available to OSA compliant scripting systems as well.<p>

As an example, you could write a simple Java app that could create user interface elements under script control and interact with the user, returning results back to the script. Sort of like FaceSpan, but with a much larger class of objects and functions available to the scripts.<p>
