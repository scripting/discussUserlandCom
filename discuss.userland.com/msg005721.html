I have a discussion group that is motor vehicle related.  I have enabled the search engine for this DG.<p>

The search engine is working pretty well.<p>

I have a small problem in that the word "gas" is not getting indexed.  I went diggin' and I found that mainResponder.search.server.indexOnePage contains the following line.<p>

oneWord = string.popTrailing (oneWord, 's') //pop off trailing s's<p>

After this, the script throws out the word because it's less than 3 chars long.  I understand why the script is popping of the s char.  Lots of plural words that would take up mucho space in the index.<p>

I really need to have the word gas in a motor vehicle related DG.  This is an example of a word that ends in s that needs to be left alone.<p>

Anyone have suggestions on how I can address this issue?<p>

Thanks much,<p>

Toodle-loooooooooo........
