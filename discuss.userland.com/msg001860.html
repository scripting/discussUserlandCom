I've heard you say "If Apple makes us an offer..." a few times now.  What exactly do you mean?<p>

A year or so ago, you mentioned the opening of The Godfather and said that Apple should be offering developers friendship instead of money.  Is that still what you're looking for?  (Or perhaps you want Jobs to make you an offer you can't refuse? :-)<p>
