Tell me about it! That's such an offensive channel, when you click on one of the links it brings up an authentication dialog.<p>

The solution is to make it respect your channel list and only include stories from channels that you have enabled. This is a first-cut only. We have a bunch more work to do before publicizing this. I think we have something that's worth promoting now, and it will grow as the weblog community grows.
