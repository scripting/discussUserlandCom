Please post any updates as responses to David's message.<br><br>	<i>PS: Don't open email enclosures, ever.</i><br><br><b>Gearing up for WWW9</b><br><br>	<a href="http://lwprotocols.org/">Ken MacLeod</a> has updating his Lightweight Protocols page, with links for people at WWW9.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/home/print.nsf/(frames)/000428DA62?OpenDocument&~f">ComputerWorld</a>: "SOAP is a starting point, [IBM's Sutor] said, intended to evoke comment and refine the protocol.

We had a very cool talk, it was on Ev's webcam, looking for ways to get our apps talk to enhance each other. <br><br>	<a href="http://www.haughey.com/">Matt Haughey</a> had some good feedback on Manila, he said the template is hard to edit (which is true, it's a web browser interface after all) and suggested shipping with a virtually empty template, which I thought was an interesting idea, and one I had not heard before.<br><br>	We also talked about linking our membership systems. How many different times do you want to enter your mother's maiden name? There should be a button on every membership signup page that says You Know Who I Am. Click on it and the form is filled out with information that comes from a central server. Dale Dougherty wrote a passionate essay about this a few weeks back on the Manila-Newbies mail list. I want to solve the problem, but wish to do it in a cross-vendor way.<br><br>	Another idea was linking favorites on Weblogs.Com with the Blogger home page. You could get a customized view of the weblogs that changed (they call them blogs, understandably). They would have to mirror the favorites <a href="http://static.userland.com/weblogMonitor/favorites.xml">structure</a> on their server, and be able to associate a Blogger membership with a Weblogs.Com membership. We puzzled over how to create this linkage. I think it's do-able, but I have to do some more thinking.<br><br>	<i>(Gordon's company is focused on membership, which was the focus of the conversation with Pyra. Until I wrote this story I didn't make the connection.)</i><br><br>	I then went to the baseball game (three blocks away) with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22gordon+eubanks%22&meta=lr%3D%26hl%3Den">Gordon Eubanks</a>, CEO of <a href="http://www.oblix.com/">Oblix</a>, and the former CEO of Symantec, the company I sold Living Videotext to in 1987. It was really good to see him, we had never had time to hang out and go to games when we worked together. The game was <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/05/04/SP54447.DTL">exciting</a>, really good baseball. Some incredible fielding plays, but I had to leave early to get to a birthday dinner with Dave Jacobs, Marc Canter and Sonja Scharrer. <br><br>	(After a drunk fan ran on the field I asked Gordon if he had ever been arrested. He looked at me, stared, a little smile, and then I said, Oh <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.02/undelete.html">yeah</a>!)<br><br>	<a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/daveJacobsAtGardenOfTranquility.gif"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/daveJacobsThumb.gif" height="48" width="42" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></a> Dave Jacobs is 44 today. Happy birthday Big Dave! I've known him for fourteen years. The day between our birthdays has become a sort of holiday in our circle of friends. Dave now works at Macromedia. At his previous job at Marimba he made a bunch of money and yesterday he showed us the <a href="http://www.bmw.com/bmwe/products/automobiles/mcoup/index.shtml">first toy</a> he bought with his new wealth. <i>Go Big Dave!</i><br><br>	Dave also was the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.11/fetish.html">Fetish editor</a> at Wired for a few years, a perfect casting, he's the ultimate gadget guy, Mr Rube Goldberg. So I can't wait to see the sound studio he builds in his house and I keep urging him to get a hot tub already, it's a quality of life thing as far as I'm concerned everyone should have one, certainly a friendly guy like Dave.<br><br>	Another Big Dave story. He had to fly to LA to buy the car. On the drive back, going up a mountain in fifth gear, barely touching the gas pedal, <i>going 105 mph.</i> A tear comes to his eye. Cherman engineering. We all laugh. The cool thing about Big Dave is that we know he <i>really</i> is touched by this. Me, I could care less about cars, I like software. That's another cool thing about friends. We're all different.<br><br><b>Ed Anuff's happy day?</b><br><br>	I got a really interesting picture at the game relating to Ed Anuff, who was also at Wired at the same time Dave and I were there. <br><br>	<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$636"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/edAnuffWillYouMarryMe.gif" height="9" width="102" border="0"></a> <br><br>	Click on the proposal above to find out where it appeared.<br><br>	(Ed sent me an email: "It's a prank that some of my employees pulled on me.  The human equivalent of the "ILOVEYOU" virus.)<br><br><b>Another baseball day</b><br><br>	Believe it or not I'm going to another baseball game today!<br><br>	12:05PM.<br><br>	<i>Let's go Mets!</i><br><br>	(Mets lost, great game. Lots of fun. Pictures at 10.)<br><br>
