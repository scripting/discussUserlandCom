Eric Soroos: <a href="http://www.wiredfool.com/stories/storyReader$93">Amazon's Net Patents</a>: "Amazon.com has lots of minority shareholders, and their stock has been falling. In today's legal climate, there's a significant possibly that they will have to defend against minority shareholder lawsuits."<p>

<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/03/04/0910226">Slashdot discusses</a> last night's O'Reilly post.<p>

Two other angles on the Amazon patent situation. First, a common theme, since Amazon loses money on every sale, boycotting them helps them. (Somehow I think that's too linear for today's economy.) A second angle. If you think standardized Web user interfaces are coming, as I do, Amazon may be digging themselves into a hole. Notice that the other booksellers are reverting to the shopping basket metaphor. Unless the market wholly coalesces around Amazon, they may end up switching to shopping baskets themselves at some point, if the Web is like computers, and if UI standardization catches on as it did with the Mac in the early-mid 80s.<p>

The benefit of UI standardization was that users could use more than one app, a concept that, when translated to the Web, means a user can use more than one Web site. Today's Web has more in common with Hypercard stacks than it does with desktop apps, but the idea of Web applications is still pretty new.<p>

Familiar names to people who follow the xml-dev list, xml.com and xmlhack.com. As usual, meeting the people face to face makes all the difference. Peter is very cheerful fellow. Simon is young! (Who knew?) And Tim is pulling back from W3C, encouraging us to work with Apache.Org (no problem) and getting ready to launch his new web application, which of course uses XML, and will do something interesting with weblogs. <i>Excellent!</i><p>
