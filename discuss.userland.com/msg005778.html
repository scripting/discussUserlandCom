I didn't realize how many people were tuning into news.userland.com.<p>

I got home late last night, and decided to check the web for new stories. My CMS checks (automatically) if there's a DG message for the day, and if not, creates one.<p>

So now, at 7:21AM, I'm just starting to scan for stories, and the page and the message will start filling up, assuming something is happening on the web.
