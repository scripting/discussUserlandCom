On the other hand it is very restricted.
-You get the source.
-Incase you are the first person to release the software, it ensure that you get the future release as a user. This is very good.
-Incase you are someone who modified a GPL'ed software, you get to thank the author for his work by making your changes available to all. This is good and binding. I suppose the binding is restrictive.<p>

I am a Open Source developer, I have modified and released software which was GPL'ed and hence stayed GPL'ed.
Though, I prefer the freedom of BSD and similar licenses, at the expense of possible forking.<p>
