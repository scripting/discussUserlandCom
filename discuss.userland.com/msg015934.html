<i>The <object> element in html and xhtml was designed to markup the content from this type of embeded script. It also provides the author the ability to cite a nested structure of alternative sources for same content based on which MIME types are understood by the server and client. It does so with out mangling the html, so that a document can be mirrored across different servers without being trashed.<p>

Script language="NirvanaScript" type="text/frontier"</i><p>

So an implementation of Pike, for instance, might <ul><li>behave like a browser, <li>get a web page with a script in it, and <li>execute that Frontier script. </ul><p>

Or <ul>
<li>IE might get that page, 
<li>recognize the mime enclosure, 
<li>launch Pike and pass the mimed content, 
<li>Pike processes it, executing scripts or manipulating outlines or whatever you can get Pike to do, 
<li>Pike returns the results to the browser. </ul><p>

Perhaps a way to work around the peer-to-peer problems that firewalls pose to Pike now? <p>

Also, this lets the Pike button launch Pike straight from the browser, with all the information it needs to do something. <p>
