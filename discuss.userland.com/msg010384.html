Now they are stored (and managed) in a discussion group. <p>

I have a script by Matt Neuburg, that will switch from static to dynamic rendering or vice verse, from one of the mailing lists in may.<p>

Now I wounder if this is the "state of the art" on this subject, or if there is other scripts/texts that I should know of before starting to adopt my site. I'm greateful for pointers.<p>

Here is Matts mail:<p>

Amazingly, you can't - not without changing the site rather drastically
each time you switch rendering methods. Unless, that is, you are willing
to
tinker with UserLand's scripts. I am, of course. This is what the whole
"Rendering a site both ways" argument was about, over on Frontier-Users
last month. I repeat my conclusions, i.e., this is what you need to do in
order for the identical self-same site to render both ways:<p>

--<p>

All right then: let me summarize what I've discovered so far. In the
site's
prefs, add flrender and spaceGif. To your site's firstFilter, add these
lines:<p>

try &#123;
	if adrpagetable^.responder == "default" &#123;
		adrpagetable^.imageextensions = false;
		adrpagetable^.fileextension = ""&#125;&#125;<p>

Now, in html.refglossary, where it says:<p>

if html.inResponder (adrPageTable) &#123;
	path = string.popSuffix (path) + ".wsf"&#125;;<p>

add this:<p>

try
	if adrpagetable^.responder == "default" &#123;
		path = string.popsuffix(path)&#125;&#125;<p>

Then, in html.getPath, where it says:<p>

if html.inResponder (adrPageTable) &#123;
	return (fname + ".wsf")&#125;<p>

*before* that, add this:<p>

try &#123;
	if adrpagetable^.responder == "default" &#123;
		return fname&#125;&#125;<p>

Finally, in html.getPath again, where it says:<p>

if fileExtension == "" &#123;
	fileExtension = html.getPagePref ("fileExtension", adrDest,
adrPageTable)&#125;<p>

add this:<p>

try &#123;
	if adrpagetable^.responder == "default" &#123;
		fileExtension = ""&#125;&#125;<p>

There may be other changes needed as well, but for the sites I've
experimented with so far, that suffices to make them work both ways. If I
learn more, I'll let you know. m.<p>
