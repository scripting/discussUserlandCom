Patriotism. Loyalty. Sacrifice. <p>

God. Country. Family. <p>

Would you sacrifice your children in war to preserve the Internet you know and love, with its attendant promise for a better future for generations unborn?<p>

Would you change your citizenship to a country with better Internet connections and fewer Internet roadblocks? To reach your full potential as an artist or human being? <p>

Is the Internet the America of 1778? of 1900? A place of refuge and immigration from religious persecution? from tyrants? from want? Are the streets paved with gold? Can anyone become president? <p>

Is the Internet the America of 1975? A land of pop stars, excitement, where anyone can start a garage band and rock to the top of the charts. <p>

The Internet may embody the best of the American Dream but it is far from assured. And the ticket to admission is still for the wealthy. And the dreams are far from easy to achieve. There is work to be done. <p>
