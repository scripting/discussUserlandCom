(It's my job.)<p>

I find that the local Apple reps, and most Apple people I've talked to actually, are pretty receptive.<p>

It's the people higher up in the chain that do not seem to be taking the feedback. If they did, big customers would be able to order custom-configured Macs with custom software installations, we'd be able to order speakers with professional Macs from the Apple Store, we'd have a terminal emulator in the OS, and we'd be able to connect natively to SMB/CIFS file servers.<p>

I do appreciate Apple's persistence in their major products. Even if they don't get a product right at first, they make a good, first, generally exciting pass at it. Stir up the industry. (Take AirPort for example.) And each iteration is generally better.<p>

But still, they miss a lot of things that their customers want. Did I ask for a new interface? No, I asked for functionality that would let Macs fit in better.
