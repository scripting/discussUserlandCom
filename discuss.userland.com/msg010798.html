I almost excluded <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1013">this channel</a> because it's been broken for quite some time. But I am interested in Mobile Computing, and his links in the past have been interesting. Looking at his XML <a href="http://www.mobilestart.com/fat_headline_shortcuts.asp">file</a> I can see why it's broken. The links aren't correctly specified. The <linetext> part of a link must match some part of the <text> for the <item>. <p>

I'm posting this here because it might provide some help to another channelmaster, and other people may be able to help explain the problem. I'm sending an email with a pointer to this posting.
