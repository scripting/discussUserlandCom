<i>There are things we can do to make it that way, by giving the system manager control over what verbs can be executed by applications on the server, but no such controls are there now.</i><p>

It would also be helpful if the server manager could specify that scripts initiated from within table x.y.z can only modify data within tables a, b, and c.<p>

My biggest concern with a frontier-related hosting service is ensuring that scripts in one site can't tromp (usually accidentally) on the data in somebody else's site. Right now, the only solution is for the sysadmin to pore over every new script, to identify for security issues.
