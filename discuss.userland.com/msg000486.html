The mail alias in our case contained every single employee -- worldwide!<p>

The unfortunate solution for the systems division was to appoint a censor to the list who had to approve every message before it went out. This of course caused a number of other problems -- mainly that the censor applied his own value system when approving mail out to the list. <p>

On one occasion, we had to notify people in the field that our central Intranet server was going down for a hardware upgrade. The censor deemed this a local issue not a global one, and deleted the mail. <p>

Well -- on the positive side -- I didn't have to read about missing coffee cups in Paris anymore.<p>
