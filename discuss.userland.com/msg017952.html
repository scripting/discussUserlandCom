They're not staffed by volunteers, and their ISP is not just giving them bandwidth out of charity.  At some point, they're going to have to <i>sell</i> something, and not just burn through venture capital, in order to get money to pay those bills.
<p>
Furthermore, they're now competing with Gnutella and Freenet, which <i>are</i> developed by volunteers, and which can also use bandwidth donated by their users.  At some point, Napster has to provide a product or service that the free file-sharing services can't easily duplicate; otherwise, even if Napster succeeds in court, it will fail in the marketplace.
