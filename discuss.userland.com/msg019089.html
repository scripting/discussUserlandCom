It has been quick to assert remarkably heavy-handed protection of its own intellectual property, as the Wall Street Journal noted today." Dan, this is important, the WSJ got the story wrong. Napster did not hold onto the protocol. It's openly documented and they've helped the cloners. This is central to the Journal piece, it reeks of a smear, <i>and they got the facts wrong.</i><br><br>	<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2000/07/27/napster_shutdown/index.html">Scott Rosenberg</a>: "Instead of going to court, of course, the music industry could be figuring out ways to use Napster to sell more music. After all, here's a piece of software that cultivates people's taste for new music and that appeals to the most dedicated fans. What a sales opportunity!

One of them, David Weekly, a Stanford University student, put a version of them on his personal Web site. Soon, he received an electronic message from Napster demanding that he take it down."<br><br>	This demands clarification. Whatever differences they may have had in the past, the Weekly site <a href="http://weekly.org/code/napster.php3">currently has the Napster spec</a>. The spec is widely distributed around the Net. I asked Fanning and Kessler about this when I met with them last month and they said it's OK with them, and that they give advice on mail lists to Napster cloners. <br><br>	AP: <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20000726/tc/napster_showdown.html">Court showdown for Napster</a>.<br><br>	News.Com: <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-2345237.html?tag=st.ne.1002.tgif.ni">Napster trial won't end music industry headaches</a>.<br><br><b>If you were the judge?<a name="ifYouWereTheJudge">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/26#ifYouWereTheJudge" title="Permanent link to 'If you were the judge?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Survey: <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/shutDownNapster">Shut down Napster?</a><br><br><b>Joel on Passport<a name="joelOnPassport">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/26#joelOnPassport" title="Permanent link to 'Joel on Passport' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$139">Joel Spolsky</a>: "Am I the only one who is terrified about Microsoft Passport?
