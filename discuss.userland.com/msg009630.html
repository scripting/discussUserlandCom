Not accurate; I'm merely "an" enginner.<p>

Jame's following message is correct, in that the server portion can be handled by CGI requests through personal web sharing.<p>

That being said, I've been working on a suite of applescripts to make CGI creation easier, and hope to wrap them up this week.  We're having a developers kitchen in Cupertino, and I'm learning a lot about the way our customers use AppleScript.  I'll take a look at Jame's client code, to see if it can be adapted to a server.<p>

(My previous approach to XML-RPC was to create a shared library out of Clark's expat, and provide an OSAX to pumpt data in and out.)
