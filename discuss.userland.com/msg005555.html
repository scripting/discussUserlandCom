Why do you care is you use a screwdriver or a butterknife to put in a screw? ;) One just 'feels right' I'm convinced that it really is something that can't be fully explained. I've got an NT machine and a Mac on my desk, I can't help but feel like my productivity just drains when I use the NT machine... I have gotten accustomed to using it for browsing and email, but even then, when I need to interact with the *operating system* it stinks...
