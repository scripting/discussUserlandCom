You can put up with a zillion confirmation dialogs for
doubleclick cookies, you can turn the feature off (conveniently
or not), or you can run away from all the mass consumption sites
that use doubleclick and their ilk.<p>

You can refuse to accept cookies now, of course, or refuse to
accept cookies sent back to a different server.  But no one
who's turned on that "warn me" method has
left it on for long, I'd guess.  If you're really serious about
opting out, you need something like
