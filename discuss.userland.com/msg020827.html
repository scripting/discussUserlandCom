If you noticed, I thought better of the comment and changed it immediately after I hit the send button. No disrespect meant, I was just voicing my opinion.<p>

As I've said before, I think the major problem is that the RSS-DEV group is trying to continue on with (what they see as) the original vision of RSS (RDF Site Summary) whereas Dave wants RSS to be something completely different (Real Simple Syndication).<p>

The right thing (IMNSHO) to do would be for Dave to take a different name, but I don't think he's going to do that. So I've offered to take a different name, so that we can move on and stop fighting about it. That's what's important to me -- the name doesn't mean anything.<p>

Again, my apologies. No disrespect meant.
