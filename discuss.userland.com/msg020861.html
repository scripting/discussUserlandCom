having downloaded BIAPs go'trieve recently i was surprised to figure out how similar to frontier its architecture seems to be.
there is an odb ( it's even called ".odb)  with a built in template driven webserver with xml as exchange and agent programming format. obviously there are also running SOAP and RSS-demons beside the main HTTP-demon, everything is configurable via HTML-templates and so on. <p>

this made me very curious. has anyone else downloaded and tested go'trieve ? what do you think about it?<p>

would be nice to remotely control go'trieves agents via radio userland or better xml-RPC !!!<p>
