It's an untrappable error that occurs in external objects, bringing down the entire website. One common cause is stored procedure calls with incorrect parameter types. There are many other causes...cruise the ASP websites and you'll find a lot of information about it.<p>

If you're doing ASP you'll need to get Interdev rather than Frontpage. It costs a bit more but Frontpage insists on rearranging your code, and last I checked did it in a way that breaks ASP.<p>

Interdev 6 has something called the Data Environment. If you're using stored procedures it doesn't buy you much, if you're not it might help a bit. Most developers are moving away from it these days. If you need to change any data access code in the DE it restarts the entire website.
