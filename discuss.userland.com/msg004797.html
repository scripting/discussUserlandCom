I finally decided to just punt and write them in html 4.0, using the <colgroup> and <col width="40%"> tags (and </col> and </colgroup>, natch). Netscape Communicator 4.5 Mac doesn't render them exactly like I want, but iCab doesn't complain about the html, and IE gets 'em pretty close to what I'd like to see. WebTV doesn't display them with the column widths I ask for, but it's not horribly wrong, either.<p>

I guess my point is that for my stuff, I've decided to move forward to the next standard, and hope the browsers comply.
