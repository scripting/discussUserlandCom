I'm no fan of Mattel, but I doubt they are to blame for Purple Moon's failure. Sure, it makes an easy story for a reporter to write, but what really happened?<p>

I know a few people who either worked at or with Purple Moon, and from each and everyone I heard that the place was managed horribly. And I've not used the CD-ROMs, but of those I know who have, no one found them very impressive.<p>

I have some familiarity working with a cool small company that failed because I worked at Voyager. And while it's easy to pin the blame of Voyager's demise on "the market" or "big media corporations" that took over CD-ROMs, a huge factor in Voyager's failure was that it's management screwed itself over and essentially drove it into the ground. <p>

It's annoying, though obvious, that journalists will take the easiest road possible to a story and frame the whole article around it, whether or not it has any true bearing on reality.
