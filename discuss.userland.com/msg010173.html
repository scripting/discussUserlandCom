That URL should point to the content *only* of the story (possibly in plain text with no newlines to prevent people from using that link to avoid banners); no navigation tools, no banners, no extras.<p>

This is the key to solving the scalability problem of the search engines. If each site had an RSS that pointed to everything that was new on the server, in a search-friendly format; and if each search engine had an email address <a href="mailto:rss-incoming@alltheweb.com">rss-incoming@alltheweb.com</a>; and if every site mailed their RSS whenever it changed - then everything in the search engines would be up-to-the-minute and coverage would be 100% (of the RSS-aware servers).<p>

There would be trust problems, of course, but the search engines would be free to index only RSS files from trusted sites, or to compare one URL to the other.<p>
