It's clear there's a large group of people that don't think RSS 1 is it, so let's stop worring about personal squables and get to the real work at hand.<p>

"ASP" exists today as "Application Service Providers" and "Active Server Pages," maybe RSS can be "Real Simple Syndication," "RDF Site Summary" and "Repetitive Stress Syndrom " :-)  We'll just have to deal with the confusion, if we're right one will gain more traction then the other anyway.<p>

(oops, was just checking UserLand to see if it's "Real" or "Really" and see that Dave believes RSS is a name, not an acronym)
