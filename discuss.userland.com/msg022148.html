I write here in real-time. I make mistakes and correct them, when I see them, but sometimes they stay. All the back issues are archived, accessible through the calendar in the right column on this <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">page</a>. Every night at 10PM the contents of Scripting News goes out via email to several thousand people who <a href="http://www.userland.com/dailyUpdates">subscribe</a>. And several dozen people receive Scripting News via RSS syndication, and I expect that will grow over time.<br><br>	Scripting News is where my ideas get a chance to be refined before (when I have the time) I write a more formal essay about them, in "DaveNet". Sometimes things are moving so fast that I just write real-time in DaveNet, but that's pretty exceptional. <br><br>	DaveNet is our oldest editorial product. It started in <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1994">1994</a>, and was the beginning of something that's become much bigger than just one guy keeping a log of the ideas he wants to give away for free.<br><br><b>Let a thousand flowers bloom<a name="letAThousandFlowersBloom">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/04/15#letAThousandFlowersBloom" title="Permanent link to 'Let a thousand flowers bloom' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Let a thousand flowers bloom' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://2020hindsight.editthispage.com/2001/04/14"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/flowers20202001.gif" height="37" width="44" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right"></a>At the Web Services Workshop on Thursday in San Jose, at lunch I sat an incredible table. Bob Sutor and David Fallside of IBM. Andrew Layman of Microsoft. <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$683">Sanjiva</a>, the IBM guy who wrote the SOAP for Java that's now part of Apache. <br><br>	One of those magic moments. So many smart people. A basic disagreement. How many SOAP stacks will there be? I want (picking a number out of the air) one hundred. Most were not agreeing with me. I looked at Andrew but said to the group, how well is it going now that there's one browser?<br><br>	Every great creative market has a <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=cacophony">cacophony</a> of diversity. I've been lucky to be part of several booming markets, the Apple II, IBM PC, Macintosh, and the early Web. The thing they all had in common was a constant stream of surprising products. Customers lining up to buy stuff. Pacts between gorillas never lead to this kind of creativity. <br><br>	So, not knowing what the killer app of SOAP will be, or even if there will be one, I trust cacophony. I don't trust gorillas.<br><br>	"curly"<br><br>
