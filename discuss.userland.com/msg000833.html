I know what all the words mean, more or less, but the sentence doesn't quite compute to me. <p>

SOmething that serves dynamic content, HTML text with macros in it, that's as popular as ASP/Allaire is on Windows. <p>

Linux's strength is as a server platform, the Mac/Windows combination is relatively strong in editorial/graphics. So our goal is to bring people together on the platforms they're happy with for all possible kinds of writing, editing and serving. <p>

On a practical level this means including bits of other people's scripts in the pages we generate. That's one of the reasons Brent is starting up a Linux server, so we can get a feel for what the options are, and if one method of rendering dynamic content on Linux emerges over all the others, we'll have a test-bed ready to experiment with.<p>
