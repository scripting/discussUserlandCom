There's lots of it. I'll give $25,000 to the musicians. Jacob said he'd come up with $50,000 yesterday. That's just two music lovers and we're already at $75,000. How much money do the musicians want? I bet not a lot. Like software guys, they need new equipment, food, drugs, sex, and a vacation every once in a while. They probably also should have health insurance. After that, what else? Money money, just a distraction. Go listen to Bob Dylan and tell me it's about money.
