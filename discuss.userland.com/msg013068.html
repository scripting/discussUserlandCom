I'm in sympathy with your desire to keep the spec clean.  There's always a battle between flexibility (the extendable spec) and simplicity (the standard spec).  It's easier to balance them if the keeper(s) of the spec are active.<p>

Hm.  What if -- I'm not an XML expert, here, shoot me if this is sloppy -- the RSS spect included a <LocalData> element, which could contain whatever local info was necessary?<p>

Oh, and I'd really like it if the spec allowed for UNIX timestamps.  It's just so much easier to do some things with those, although I too have been convinced that it won't work for a default.
