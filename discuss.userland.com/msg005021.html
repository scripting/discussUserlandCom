When serving pages through mainResponder you can have a cell (of type string) just containing this macro:<p>

&#123;mainResponder.redirect("http://an.url")}<p>

Useful for:
	<p>

o Including a discussion thread in the structure of a 'normal' website. Maybe you have a text that you want to get opinions on/discuss before it is permanently placed in the site.<p>

o Make a shortcuts table, so that you can give out short domain names to pages that realy are burried deep down in the hierarcy.<p>

<hr size=2 width=100%><p><p><p>

This also works the other way. If you have a cell (of type string) with the following text:<p>


&#123;string(memepool.messages.["0000014"].body)}<p>

it will include that text. (But the page will have a wacky title.)<p>

(It will not work with just &#123;memepool.messages.["0000014"].body} , since that text is included as soon as the cursor leaves the cell.)
