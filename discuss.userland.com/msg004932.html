I'm never comfortable doing controlled movements on a Windows mouse/tablet.<p>

              I've heard it is because a Mac mouse is tracked by hardware, whereas a Windows mouse is tracked by software. </i><p>

The original Mac mouse generated interrupts which were simply counted by software.<p>

The ADB mice came into use in 1987 and use a 9600 bps serial link run as a network (i.e. not a lot different in principle from SLIP or PPP).  That's *got* to be worse for precise and smooth mouse movement than what was on the Mac 128 - Mac Plus, but it seems to work fine.
