I was running a web server in Frontier and I switched my dial-up connections. Frontier sure didn't like that and started giving me a loop of "Out of Memory" errors (one per listen, perhaps?), then a "Free block could not be accessed" [paraphrased] error when quitting.<p>

There appears to be no damage to the root, and a restart of Frontier put everything right.<p>

I don't know if you can fix this, so it may just need to be documented that one should stop the server before switching net connections.
