To quote: "Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated, (Sykes-Nasdaq: SYKE), a diverse information technologies company, with more than 11,000 employees, provides a variety of computer-related outsourcing services to Fortune 500 firms. Sykes' business includes third party hardware and software technical support, helpdesk services, systems consulting, systems integration, diagnostic software, e-commerce solutions, documentation development and foreign language translation and localization." They do say, "SYKES handles technical and user support for many of hte world's most prominent software and hardware development companies".<p>
