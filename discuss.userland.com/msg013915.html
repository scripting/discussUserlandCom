Sometimes I get "socket not connected" or weird errors about missing objects. Just how bad is it? What's an NT2000 server? How many processors? What clock speed? How much RAM? Does the server have a RAID sub-system or just a plain old (severly fragmented) hard drive? How many hits is it getting? How many Mbps is it pushing? Is this machine serving anything else? And just what is the price of tea in China? ;-)<p>
