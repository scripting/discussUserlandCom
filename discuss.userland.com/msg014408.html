It was a tiny little bit of XML-RPC code on the new server, and a new RPC handler on the legacy server (this machine) and they're in synch. Rather than move the Avantgo versions I left them where they are. This is a small side-benefit.<p>

The thing I continue to like about "XML-RPC" is that the easy things are ridiculously easy. It was a tiny little bit of code, really just a warmup project.
