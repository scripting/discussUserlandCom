conforming to HTML 4.0 specifications.  It puts either a smiley face, stern
face, or a frown face depending on whether there is either full compliance,
just warnings, or errors.  Your Scripting News page gives a frown face!!<p>

I am finding that iCab has become my primary browser for a single reason. 
It blocks ads.  Moreover, when I'm browsing a site and find that an ad has
managed to slip by unfiltered, I can simply click on that image and add it
to my filter list.  iCab lets you filter images by server, filename, path,
URL, and even a specific common image dimension.  Much more useful that
other standalone utilities.<p>

Also, it never crashes...
Also, it was a 850K download...<p>

I can't believe this was developed by one guy over the course of a year. 
Along with GoLive, I think those Germans are onto something.<p>

If you haven't checked iCab out yet, I wholeheartedly recommend that you do.<p>

Best regards,
