But if there were a de-facto standard editor applet (or small group of them), soon they'd be cached by many browsers. Not a clean solution at all, but it would feel to you that it just happened.<p>

And this doesn't address the fact that the user should really be able to choose which type of editor widget is in use on his/her machine. For instance, I vastly prefer the vi editor style. And unless I specifically make that happen for myself, I fully assume I would never see that coming down in an applet on a site such as this.<p>

This is an interesting situation where the download-on-demand model of Java applets is not servicing the problem very well. But I don't like the native code solution of ActiveX or whatever. It just strikes me as another compromise (compromising the Mac and Linux, surely).<p>

It's too bad that there isn't some way to tag a "get the editor that the user likes to use" instruction into a page.
