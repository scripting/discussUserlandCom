The thing you eventually create might not even have to be recognizable as a "browser". It could simply use the base rendering code for reading HTML/XML but have a totally different UI/ feature set.  So in this respect it would not have to "compete" with other browsers, because it would instead be a different animal that just had similar features..<p>

Sorry, not to belabour this point. It's just that I'm wanting to offer up additional ideas for folks to think about - not to try to influence anything.<p>

I'm just a lowly web designer who happens to work at netscape - but I'm close enough to be following the cool stuff at mozilla.org and I wanted to say that there is more of a choice about things that what you might have originally thought.<p>

I can understand though how you would feel reluctant to put x amount of work into a feature if it were not destined to be in the "branded" release.<p>

I'm not really the person to talk to about that, I'd talk instead to the top folks at mozilla.org like Brendan or Jamie.
