It's free to download, support costs $US 99 if you like it.<p>

What it seems to do (I only gave it a brief test) is convert an HTML document (including links) to a PDF. Images etc are conserved. It's available for just about everything BUT the Mac. Source code is available too for the strong of heart. GUI and command-line operation is possible, so it's callable from a script (I think).<p>

I know that we should make more things available online, but when I'm doing a seminar, or writing a chapter in a book, sometimes I need a way to actually put my Frontier content into print.<p>

Try it, feedback results to this group if you have any.<p>
