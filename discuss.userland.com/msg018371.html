"Representatives of the phonograph recording industries in the
1900’s strongly argued to Congress that records merely served as
advertising for the sheet music market; radio station owners in
the 1920’s argued that radio served similarly to advertise the sales
of sheet music; library photocopying of journal articles in the
1950’s and 1960’s was described by some as primarily an
advertisement for the journals; the Supreme Court found that
cable television in the late 1960’s merely promoted broadcast
television."<p>
