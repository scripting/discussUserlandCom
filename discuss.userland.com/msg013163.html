We use a system from <a href="http://www.engage.com">Engage</a> - <a href="http://www.engage.com/products/adbureau/default.htm">Ad Bureau</a> where by they host the ad engines, but we deal with all the content/ads that appear on our sites.<p>

Interesting point of note - Engage have just joined up with Flycast to implement their profiling systems over Flycasts network: <a href="http://www.engage.com/press/releases/110999prflycast.htm"><a href="http://www.engage.com/press/releases/110999prflycast.htm">http://www.engage.com/press/releases/110999prflycast.htm</a></a>.
