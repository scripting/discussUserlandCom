Yes, but the requirement is not being enforced by the USPTO.  Otherwise, Amazon would never have been able to patent the  equivalent of "I'll take this -- put it on my tab."  There's nothing novel about the <b>idea</b>, and the implementation is obvious to anyone skilled in developing web applications.<p>

Not good.  Not good at all.
