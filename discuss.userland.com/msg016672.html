Frontier's (Pike's) XML compiler doesn't decode '&amp;gt;' to '&gt;'. As I understand the XML 1.0 spec, this is indeed a bug. We are free to <b>encode</b> '&gt;' as '&amp;gt;' or not -- but we must <b>decode</b> '&amp;gt;' to '&gt;'. This looks like a safe fix -- I don't see how it could break existing scripts.<p>

In addition to the tags listed in the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec">XML-RPC spec</a>, Frontier currently accepts <i1>, <i2>, and <float> tags as input. Of these, it only generates <i2> as output. I think Frontier should use <i4> in those cases were it's currently using <i2>. Since there may be Frontier scripts out there that rely on these additional tags, Frontier should continue to accept these additional tags as input though.
