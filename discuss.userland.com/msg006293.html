The first is good for developers (I'm one) the other is so inconsistent that it is a real pain. What I want is an interface with users in mind. It's not that I can't make an NT box work, but I don't want to be answering stupid dialogs all the time,  and searching all over the place for some misplaced preference.<p>

The MacOS is far from perfect, but for me the user experience is the best out there. I'm no UNIX specialist, but I understand that Apple went the BSD/Mach way because that is what they had and know. It turns out that their kernel has been around for quite some time and if it doesn't get the spotlights Linux gets it is far from being some exotic unknown kernel; quite the contrary. If they can hide this monster under the MacOS then it will be heaven.<p>

Antoher point that strikes me is that Linux (the kernel) is 5% of a given distribution and that the rest is available on other UNIX's. What if the best part of Linux was those other 95% ?
