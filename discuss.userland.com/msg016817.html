USB and Firewire are about as painless as protocols can be. Firewire is even covering <a href="http://www.micronet.com/products/sancube.html">SANs</a> which do for storage what you want for scanning. Other interfaces are nightmares which is why they are going away.<p>

TWAIN is as established a standard as you'll find for scanning and should work on any platform. I don't much worry about buying a scanner for the Mac (in spite of what it says on the side of the box). So long as it can physically connect to the machine, I expect there will be a TWAIN driver to support it.
