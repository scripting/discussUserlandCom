Dave, I too want to edit my weblog primarily in Frontier instead of in a web browser. I'd like to do it the way you do it for two reasons: 1) I don't have to develop my own procedures; and 2) I can be pretty confident that your procedures will be supported as Frontier evolves.<p>

P.S. I'd *really* love to have a search engine that indexes my weblog in Scripting News style.
