One thing that often gets overlooked is that most of the XML-RPC implementations are open source. It pretty much belongs to the open source community (not the lower case), and given the people at the O'Reilly conf, it seems that not only should it be evangelized there, but its future should also be discussed.<p>

In that sense, taking a broad view, I think Cam, when he refers to Dot-Net, is falling into the same trap that the rest of the Open Source people are, looking only to Microsoft, and unwilling to look elsewhere. <p>

All that you can take away from this is that they will not play a role in the evolution of this stuff. That's too bad, I keep the door open, our philosophy is inclusive, I'll ignore the politics in the GNU license agreement, and keep going forward. <p>

Maybe when the Open Source community grows up, as you say it will, some leaders who want to go somewhere will show up. Then they'll have already figured it out, and they'll be writing Web Apps with XML-RPC or whatever they invent.<p>

Yours in rambling,<p>
