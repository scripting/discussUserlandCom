I was looking at CVS and Microsoft Source Safe.  But I was wondering if you think Frontier would work for something like this?  <p>

I think a really simple version control system could be made if there is a simple "diff" function to compare two entries of the database.  I am not really that savvy with Frontier, but I know there are lots of Joes who are.  <p>

The reason I thinking of Frontier is A. It has a nice Hierarchal DB that seems logically suited to a Version Control System.  B. It also has neat Web integration(for browsing a source tree on the web).  C. It also with the XML built in, it could allow all sorts of front ends to be made on any system you want.  <p>

So tell me if this is something people would be interested in?  I'd have to seriously brush up on my Frontier before I attemtped it, but if anyone else out there wants to try it, I am more than willing to use your code.  :-)
