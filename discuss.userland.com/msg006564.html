First, we have a bunch of updates in the queue, we're going to get them out real soon, I keep pressing this issue with the team, and they're listening. We have a big demo we're aiming at for Monday, it's been on the calendar since late April, and I think Andre has taken ownership of this. Expect updates to mainResponder.root, particularly mainResponder.discuss, towards the end of next week.<p>

We also wanted to let things settle down among the users after the 6.0 ship. You had the advantage of being in the loop during its development, and you're an exceptionally smart Frontier developer. We shipped a lot of new functionality in 6.0, and there's a lot for people to learn. It's good that there haven't been a lot of updates, it's good because it gives people a chance to get familiar with what's there before it changes.<p>

I can see this on my own team, also smart guys who were in the loop during the development of 6.0. Only now are we confident of what we're doing when we change stuff in mainResponder. We have an extra burden, what we ship has to make sense to everyone else too. No quick hacks possible here.<p>

About security, object ownership, version control, etc, I know you and I have talked about this before. We're not going to do this on a whole object database level, we're using the discuss.root structure as our groupware backbone.<p>

Re the rate at which things are happening, we're still slowing down after the 6.0 ship. We've been really straight, on a public level, about our direction. Many of the things you point out are things we would like to do right away. We'll do them. Whatever. You must be getting a clearer picture of how we work.<p>

Anyway, I of course believe everything we're doing is central to the content management problem. Perhaps our visions aren't equivalent. This is something everyone has to decide for themselves. Personally, I am more pleased with our development process and rate of progress than I ever have been in the 11-year history of UserLand.<p>

I'll re-read your message in the morning and will probably have some additional thoughts.
