The only problem is that most people's machines and connections don't lend themselves to handling large numbers of clients.<p>

But it's out there -- <a href="http://www.icecast.org">http://www.icecast.org</a><p>

(Update:  IceCast was second -- ShoutCast (<a href="http://www.shoutcast.com">http://www.shoutcast.com</a>) from the NullSoft (WinAmp) people was first, and has a page of people who are currently running their own internet radio stations)<p>
