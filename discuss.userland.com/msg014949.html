Today I could experience first hand why he thinks it is a good idea. Doing work on a new manila site <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/why2go.atsites.de">y2go</a> I played with a digital camera. I started by documenting the procedures and ended up having a <a href="http://why2go.atsites.de/making">lot of fun</A>. The result is a photostory that proves that we do not take ourselves too seriously...<p>

And it indeed does capture the <b>spirit</b> of the work, so is useful as a documentation. Ford could expect to get a lot of comical photo stories, but people would also document loads of useful procedures.<p>

Cheers,<p>

Oliver.
