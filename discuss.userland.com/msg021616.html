I got snookered into defending myself on a personal level in my own damned DG. This is not happening again. I wouldn't let it happen to someone else. <p>

This discussion stops now. Get back to safe ground guys, talk about yourselves if you want. I did good, even great work, making this stuff happen. Tim did nothing to make RSS work. He twisted things around, my acts of generosity were made out to be selfish. <p>

Move this discussion over to Tim's DG. Ask him why it's not open. No more of this here. If it doesn't stop, I will shut down the DG.
