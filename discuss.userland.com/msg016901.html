And you can download Sun's Blackdown-derived JDK right from <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a> .   I can't believe the guy did very extensive research.  Didn't even check to see if Sun offers a Linux JDK.  Just go <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/">here</a>.<p>

<i>Java on the server is becoming much more popular and depending on the application, Java within the browser might not be the best solution</i><p>

The whole 'Java sucks in the browser' bit is besides the point, and seems to be the focus of the entire article...  Browser support sucks == Java sucks is what it boils down to, and is a bit of a fallacy.<p>

If Java fails, it'll fail becuase Sun is trying to use it to lock people into Sun, no matter what their 'Community License' says.  And that's my opinion.  I'm not going to state it in a way that makes it sound as if it was passed down from on high.<p>

Java is very useful on the server side, and runs very well there.<p>

But I do most of my own personal development in Python, so there you go.<p>
