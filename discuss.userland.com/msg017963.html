I think the question is very relevant if we want to consider doing a venture that will compensate artists for their work yet make money for investors also. I am serious about this venture. Are you, or aren't you? </i><p>

It depends on what you mean by serious. I might be, like you, ready to invest some money in it, but not sure about what if anything we might do with software. I have an inkling we could make a contribution here, but I'm also thankful to Napster for being the legal lightning-rod. I like doing software and listening to music. And I'm talking with everyone I can to get better perspectives on what can be done. Hope this helps.
