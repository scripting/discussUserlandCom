The personal edition is free! I do not use it yet, but the feature list shows a huge amount of import/export filters (as well as Word97 documents):<p>

<i>"StarOffice 5.0 especially facilitates a problem-free switch for Microsoft Office users. The compatibility with other desktop applications is also guaranteed by the high-performance conversion filters."</i><p>

StarOffice is available for Windows and MacOS as well (but I think the MacOS version still needs some tweaking).<p>


But referring to your SQL7/Exchange problems:<p>

I totally agree with anyone, who is claiming, that <b>this OS dependency is not what customers want</b> (as Mr. Gates always is argumenting for Microsofts primary strategy for maintaining quality).<p>

And that is exactly what I called <i>dealing with OS issues, while you actually wanted to deal with application issues</i> in an earlier message.<p>
