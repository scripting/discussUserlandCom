Is it as easily scriptable as Dave suggests?</em><p><p>The membership information would be quite simple to extract. Not all of the system-logged events are stored with membership, so some of it would required a bit more digging. Unfortunately, I won't get a chance to look into this for a few days, but I'll post here when I come up with something.<p><p>
