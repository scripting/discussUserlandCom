The effect would be to send out a form letter email to an address that you have listed for the site being linked to asking for permission to link to that article. Until such permission is received, the log entry stays on hold.<p>

If you can automate the process at your end sufficiently, then their linking policy has two effects: 1) As long as InfoWorld doesn't allow linking, people who find their news at your site end up at competitors of InfoWorld who are covering the same stories; 2) Some poor guy at InfoWorld has to deal with an email for every news item that you want to link to, but the automated process is not generating any extra work for you.
