They sued them, won, got their reparations, and they still don't want to deal with them. <br><br>	(Lars Ulrich doesn't understand how Napster works.)<br><br>	Hank Barry from Napster was just right, Americans love music, he says, and they're loving it more now that we have Napster. That's the big story. Charge us some money and shut up. It's interfering with the fun. What a bunch of stinkers. (Barry didn't say all that, he's a lawyer, but I did, I'm not.)<br><br>	The most compelling speaker, and most understated, was Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, one of the 60s bands that started it all. He never made any money from his record deals, even though his songs topped the charts. Another artist comes out. <br><br>	McGuinn likes MP3.Com, he has a <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/jimmy/folkden/index.html">folk music site</a>, and gives away the music (presumably because it's his love) and MP3.Com gets more distribution for his music. He's glad for Napster, it's meant higher sales for him (ie non-zero) and he likes the idea that people are listening to Mr. Tamborine Man, Turn Turn Turn and Eight Miles High. (I'm listening to them right now as I write this.)<br><br>	Two Senators, Hatch and Leahy, seemed to know their stuff, and Hatch esp asked tough questions of the RIAA president Hilary Rosen. My Senator, Feinstein, was stuck on the copyright issues. Very anti-Napster. Makes sense (kind of) since the music industry is big money in my state, and perhaps Feinstein is beholden to their pov. <br><br>	OTOH, 20 million people use Napster now, and let's hope many of them vote in the next election. The other senators were certainly aware of the potential political power of the Napster users. Maybe this time we'll use the power.<br><br>	The guy from Gnutella, Gene Kan, scares me. A riveting speaker. He's the guy Andreessen <a href="http://www.gonesilent.com/about.html">invested</a> in. While he scared me, I recognize that he's a valuable insurance policy, should the music industry prevail in their suit with Napster.<br><br>	<a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20000712/re/tech_napster_dc_5.html">Reuters</a> report on the hearing. <br><br>	Hearings.Com has an <a href="http://www.hearings.com/client/hearing.asp?HID=281&ID=40">audio transcript</a> of the hearing.
