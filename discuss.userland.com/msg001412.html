This is a high stakes gamble that, once the case is sent to the Senate, some evidence compelling enough to win over 12 opposition senators will appear.  It's a ridiculous and expensive state of affairs, with little hope of success.  If the House was serious about removal they would build an iron-clad case before sending it to the Senate.  What they're doing now tells me they don't really think they can remove Clinton, so they'll have another shot at tarnishing his image -- as if it could get any blacker than it already is!<p>

There are many things I dislike about Clinton, including the cavalier disregard he seems to have for his wife. But I do admire him for apparently being the only pol in Washington resolutely serving the interests of the people.  He's gotten a lot done in the last few months.  The others could learn a lesson from him.<p>
