Aqua is a look-and-feel (i.e. a "theme"). It doesn't do anything. The part of MacOS X that actually pushes the pixels is Quartz.<p>

Meanwhile, Eazel is building a set of apps that are equivalent to the Finder and various control panels and setup assistants that MacOS has. Eazel's apps are being built on the GNOME+Gtk framework, which doesn't seem to have as many fancy features as Quartz, but they're working on it.
