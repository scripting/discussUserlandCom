If only the programmer's weren't so selfish they would make tools that we could use but they don't because then we wouldn't need them anymore.<p>

This led people to develop scripting languages that were supposed to be like English, and a superior attitude about programming languages that looked "programmerish".<p>

You wouldn't believe the grief that's around this whole issue. The non-programmers are convinced we're out to get them. To them it's for real. I will try to talk with Tog, who is a smart man, and suggest that we work together instead of having it be a one-way fire-hose of condemnation. Can't work with that very well. I sure hope we don't have to go thru another one of these.
