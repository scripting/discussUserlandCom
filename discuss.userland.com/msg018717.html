The following extended quote from section is 6 is a
good taste of the material.  My intention is that this
long quote is fair use, because I expect it might move
some folks to buy the book when they otherwise would not.<p>

<blockquote>
Infinite players cannot say when their game began, nor
do they care.  They do not care for the reason that their
game is not bounded by time.  Indeed, the only purpose is
to prevent it from coming to an end, to keep everyone in play.<p>

There are no spatial or numerical boundaries to an infinite
game.  No world is marked with the barriers of infinite
play, and there is no question of eligibility since anyone
who wishes may play an infinite game.<p>

While finite games are externally defined, infinite games
are internally defined.  The time of an infinite game is not
world time, but time created within the play itself.  Since
each play of an infinite game eliminates boundaries, it
opens to players a new horizon of time.<p>

For this reason it is impossible to say how long an infinite
game has been played, or even can be played, since duration
can be measured only externally to that which endures.  It
is also impossible to say in which world an infinite game
is played, though there can be any number of worlds within
an infinite game.
