They were describing their new "Neugents" product, and mentioned "patented technology" (or something to that effect)...<p>

I scoped out their site this morning. It's not easy to find a patent reference, but I finally tracked down one <a href="http://www.cai.com/press/2000/02/win2000_ebizman.htm">here</a>, which mentions:<p>

<i>"Utilizing CA's patented neural network technology and adaptive pattern recognition techniques, Unicenter TNG Performance Neugents will predict problems and detect unusual behaviors before service is impacted on Windows 2000."</i><p>

I don't know what their techniques are, I haven't read the patents themselves yet, and I haven't seen them be heavy-handed so far, but I figured I'd raise the flag...when I get a chance at lunch, I'll try and take a closer look, and post here. (or should I put it somewhere else, Dave?)<p>

Later!!<p>
