All I said was that I would have rejected that product name. I didn't equate it with the SS. In fact, it had never occurred to me until I saw a message posted here by a Story Server user where he abbreviated the name as SS, and I cringed. All the stories my grandfather told me came up. The equation was pre-programmed into me as a child. I've seen other characterizations of my comment that were off the wall. It was just a single two-line sentence, fairly carefully worded so as not to make Vignette wrong or bad. I just said I wouldn't have done it. I was careful to make a statement about myself, not them or anyone else.<p>

BTW, I think naming a mountain Cunt Peak or Cunt Valley is kind of cute. Someday I hope we loosen up enough so I can call a product Cunt Something and have everyone go "OK, good name."<p>

As a heterosexual man, I really like them, so sue me.
