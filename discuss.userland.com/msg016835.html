Here's what I think should happen:<p>

Bill Gates calls a press conference in early May to make an announcement. He says, basically, that it's time for MS to put the DoJ lawsuit behind them, and get back to work writing software. Consequently, MS is voluntarily going to split into three parts.<p>

Company 1: Windows, Inc.<br>
This company gets all versions of MS OSs, from servers to consumer machines to handhelds. It also takes on all languages and developer tools. CEO: Bill Gates<p>

Company 2: Microsoft<br>
This company gets everything that's not in Windows, Inc., that isn't Internet related. Office, content, games, mice, keyboards, Encarta, etc. CEO: Steve Ballmer<p>

Company 3: Internet Division<br>
This isn't a real company, because Netscape already proved that there's no way for this division to stand on its own. MS chooses as part of the breakup to sell this division to <a href="http://www.chartercom.com">Charter Communications</a>. This division includes IE, IIS, FrontPage, and MSN. CEO: Paul Allen<p>

I wish I knew more about the economics of this, but I suspect that in the above scenario that Windows, Inc. would be a privately held company. There's an interesting thought or two there.<p>
