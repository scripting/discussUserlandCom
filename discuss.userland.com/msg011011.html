Glad to hear from you. I took a look at your pages, and it looks like it is a good approach. Still a ton of things are hardcoded.<p>

That is the one thing that got me to get Macromedia's Dreamweaver. It is difficult to separate form and content on that platform, but it is possible. So, I am building my site in two parts - those pages that are being done in frames, and those that aren't. The latter are constructed in Frontier, and I use the rendered site as the prototype site for Dreamweaver. Finally, I render another site from the Dreamweaver prototype site. It is a terrible kludge - content management is far superior in Frontier, and making a common glossary feature is practically impossible since the Dreamweaver-based pages don't flow through the OBDB. <p>

Oh, well, I'll get back to digging.<p>
