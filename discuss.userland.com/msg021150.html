<i>That's a great question. I meant the strict legal sense of no copyright. But I'm quite interested in the difference between the strict and practical senses, and this bears upon my license design.</i><p>

Yes. I've been told that "public domain" literally means "no copyright". Apparently, the following text makes very little sense to a good copyright lawyer:<p>

<blockquote><pre>
Copyright 2000 Sam Smith
This code is in the public domain.
</pre></blockquote><p>

<i>So the only way to get code that cannot be copyrighted is to have some copyright present, with license terms that aim to do nothing except enforce this situation.</i><p>

Even with a pre-existing license, you can often <i>add</i> a copyright to a pre-existing work. Is this a problem for you?<p>

<b>Legal Liability</b><p>

There's another thing to worry about, though: lawsuits. The case law for software liability is extremely murky, and nobody really knows how to disclaim all warranties on a piece of software. There are no fewer than four conflicting legal theories, and the courts aren't saying anything.<p>

Here are some conflicting legal theories:<p>

<ul>
<li>Some lawyers say you can't be held liable by people who didn't give you money.</li>
<li>Other lawyers say that public domain works require explicit disclaimers.</li>
<li>A third group of lawyers says that your disclaimers are useless unless you put a copyright on your work.</li>
<li>A fourth group of laywers say that you can't base disclaimers on copyright law, and that you must establish a legally binding contract with each of your users.</li>
</ul><p>

<b>Completing the Circle</b><p>

Getting back to the top of this thread, the debate between CNRI and RMS has a lot to do with this disagreement. The lawyers at CNRI appear to belong to the fourth group, and want to create a legally binding contract with every user of Python. RMS's legal advisors, on the other hand, appear to belong to the third group.<p>

So even though the lawyers are <i>arguing</i> over choice of forum, they're also building their licenses from two different branches of law. This tends to muddy the discussion considerably.<p>

Oh, and one more time: I am not a lawyer. Do not take my postings as legal advice. ;-)<p>

Cheers,<br>
