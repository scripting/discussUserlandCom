I share your love of outlines. Perhaps I'll carry on writing in them, and then just change them back to text with the popup. (Crude, but effective!)<p>

I've been looking at the Table Renderers tutorial on Script Meridian, and running over a few pointers on the Userland sites as well.<p>

I have tried this:<p>

A template (myNiceNewtemplate) containing something like<p>

<pre>
<h1>&#123;adrtable^.myHeadline}</h1>
<blockquote>&#123;adrtable^.myBodytext}</blockquote>
&#123;pagefooter()}
</pre><p>

 - and a table-to-be-rendered like this:<p>

<pre>
myTable
    default  
    myBodytext  
    myHeadline
</pre><p>

 - where default simply contains #template "myNiceNewTemplate".<p>

Yes, I know it probably looks mighty nasty in the ODB, but it opens all sorts of avenues when I stop thinking XML and start doing XML. After all, I can get data into (and out of) myHeadline and myBodytext by means of XML in a kind of neat way!<p>

Please - point out some glaring errors. I'd be grateful!
