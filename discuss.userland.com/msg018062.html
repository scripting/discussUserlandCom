Winer thinks the cooperation will discourage predatory behavior: "IBM and Microsoft and Sun will keep each other honest," he says. </i><br><br><b>XML storage<a name="xmlStorage">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/26#xmlStorage" title="Permanent link to 'XML storage' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	One of the services Microsoft described on Thursday is the XML Store. This is a very important idea. <br><br>	We're going to move here at Internet Speed. I've got a design, and a connection to our outliner, but that's just one of the tools and browsers that make sense here.<br><br>	It'll be easy to connect up any desktop app that can create or display hierarchies in some way. And there is no special server.  It's low-tech, you can use Notepad to build the structures.<br><br>	I've never worked on a juicier project with so many uses. I know this is a tease. But I want you all to get a sense of how quickly the Two-Way-Web can come online now.<br><br><b>Frontier 6.2 ships<a name="frontier62Ships">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/26#frontier62Ships" title="Permanent link to 'Frontier 6.2 ships' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Frontier 6.2 <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/changes/62">Change Notes</a>.<br><br>	Milestones are on <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/25#frontier62">yesterday</a>'s Scripting News.<br><br>	Here's the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/6.2">page</a> with links to all the info about 6.2.

He tells the story on the Weblog he's been using to organize the work. I'm glad too that this can now be in the open. Given the strong feelings on this in the Frontier user community, I felt it was best to promise nothing while the project was getting started. <br><br><b>Any lawyers tuned in?<a name="anyLawyersTunedIn">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/26#anyLawyersTunedIn" title="Permanent link to 'Any lawyers tuned in?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	The RIAA may be making a big incorrect assumption. Read the following piece and consider the quote.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.wirednews.com/news/politics/0,1283,37227,00.html">Wired</a>: "'While the Internet and MP3 technology provide budding artists without recording contracts with an inexpensive vehicle for communicating their work to the public, the predominant use of MP3 technology is the trafficking of pirated sound recordings,' said a statement in the written court documents filed by the RIAA."<br><br>	As I understand it, they lost the case against the Diamond Rio because it could be used for lawful purposes. The same is true of the MP3 download sites. If a person who has already purchased the right to listen to the music wants to be able to access the songs over the Internet, what law did they break?<br><br>	And if a person uses Napster to get a computer-playable version of a song they already own, are they doing something illegal? Surely some of these people are past or future customers. Do you think "trafficking of pirated sound recordings" is what their customers do? These guys are in trouble.<br><br>	<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$18132">Did you ever</a> see the movie Beetlejuice?
