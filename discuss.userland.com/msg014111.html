If the "collection" links had a way to indicate new messages are contained within - "qbullet.qbullets" or something like them - that would be great...a text indication would work as well.<p>

Typically I keep a discussion message open, using command-clicks to get the responses in a different window.  I like to keep a navigational reference around.<p>

like being able to customize some aspects of the discussion group interface.  More is better in  this case.  Thanks.
