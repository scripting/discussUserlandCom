I've seen
plenty of NeXT print servers that are rarely -if ever- rebooted.<p>

Which isn't to say it never happened. Significantly complex
Postscript or lots of big bitmaps might well do it.<p>

The only time this was a problem for me was when looking at
lots of big images or webpages in certain applications.<p>

Avie Tevanian posted to usenet to explain the whole issue a few years ago. Check altavista or dejanews. The system *will*
reclaim swap. It will shrink the swapfile when it can, but
if it cannot, it still reclaims the space - the swapfile is
large but mostly 'empty'. The 'empty' space within it will
be reused before the swapfile is enlarged again.<p>

Logging out and restarting the Display Postscript WindowServer
(by logging in as 'exit') will often allow the vm system to
reclaim any clogged VM and shrink the swapfile.<p>

Combined with the typical RAM & disks on machines today, I doubt
this will be a problem. If it is, add a disk for VM spillover.<p>
