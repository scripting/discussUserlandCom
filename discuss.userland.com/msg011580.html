What TV client are you using?  Obviously not the same
one as I tried, which adds icons, lines, and text boxes
to the pages I'm viewing.<p>

(Besides, merely adding 'context' can violate the moral
rights of an author.  Check the copyright laws if you
don't believe me.)<p>

<i>bordering frames in the same window that are hosted
on unrelated sites.</i><p>

Which isn't necessarily legal.<p>

<i>strong visual cues that distinguish the plug-in's content</i><p>

Making the modification obvious doesn't make it go away...<p>

...<p>

The fact remains -- until the concept of public annotations
has been tried by court, nobody knows whether it's legal or
not.  Until then, any TV user may get sued for any of the
reasons given in TV's terms of service document, and TV may
get sued for contributory infringement, or worse.  Time will
tell.<p>
