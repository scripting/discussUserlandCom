I routinely write batch files that do multi-threading by starting up background tasks.  Unfortunately I have almost no synchronization management tools at my disposal for this kind of work.  Yes, the unix shell is a tad better but not so much that it makes a difference.<p>

Today I simulate threading with extensive use of timer callbacks.  This always requires that I be able to break a given task up into bite sized chunks.<p>

I would much rather be able to just start up a thread.<p>
