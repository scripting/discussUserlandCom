Looking forward to using it when it comes to Mac. But also love Pike. I was going to deploy Pike among my interactive group as a way of providing easy formatting to non-tech users. The browser interface is great, but to get good formatting, you need to know some HTML.<p><p>So: Is this dream dead? I see that the capabilities are still there in RU, but no longer any docs online.<p><p>Was this product not popular or useful enough? I'd be curious to know why Userland modified Pike so radically instead of creating a separate app for RU.<p><p>
