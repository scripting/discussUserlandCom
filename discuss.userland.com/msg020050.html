And a distribution based on a *BSD would do better, why?<p>

You're saying RedHat's gonna fail because their business is based on software they <i>can't</i> make proprietary extensions to, but implying a distribution based on *BSD would succeed because they <i>could</i> do proprietary extensions, even if they chose not to.<p>

That's not clear to me.
