"At Buck's, the quirky, Wild West-themed power eatery in Woodside, Calif., owner Jamis MacNiven put 28 notches on his door jamb last year."<p>

NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/yr/mo/biztech/articles/14worm.html">Illness as a Metaphor for Networks</a>. "I believe that we are indeed living in a computational ecosystem which is more and more globally cross-linked," he said. Or to put it more simply, "It's an amazing system, and it's very vulnerable." <p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7301">BTW</a>, we cracked a barrier to web-hosting a few weeks ago. Lots more comments on this page. The question is how to deploy our new software. <i>It's puzzling!</i><p>

It's not surprising that <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$678">Marc Canter's channel</a> has interesting stuff on it! I like this a lot. One of my best friends is playing around on the other side of the My.UserLand.Com interface. <p>

If you generate pages with scripts, you can include Marc's channel in your home page by reading <a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/myUserLand/staticRendering/service00678.html">this static file</a>.<p>

Here's what you get when you set <a href="http://marc.canter.com/script.html">Marc loose with an outliner</a> that renders to the web.<p>

I'm reading an early release of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0767900480/qid=929291527/sr=1-3/002-1380065-7881042">Paul Andrews' history of the Internet at Microsoft</a>. The book is not out yet. <p>

It was immediately interesting to me because it includes excerpts of a <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1994/10/billgatesvstheinternet">DaveNet piece from 1994</a> and Bill Gates' <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1994/10/replyfrombillgates">response</a>. <p>

That got me thinking about whether Gates is reliving Ken Olson's career (he's founder of DEC). Thought some more and I postulate that Office 97 is fairly analogous to the PS/2, which was a disaster of proprietariness for IBM. More on that later.<p>

News.Com: <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,37739,00.html?st.ne.fd.mdh.ni">McNealy Critical of Microsoft Investments</a>. "I have yet to see a customer who is disappointed when there's interoperability between two different pieces of technology," McNealy said. "I've yet to hear them say, 'Oh darn, I plugged it in and it worked. I hate that.'"
