I slavishly follow links to wherever Scripting News points me. I frequently learn new things, which is what this is all about, right?<p>

Someone, please help me out with this <a href="http://www.crossgain.com/about/">Crossgain</a> thing. What do they actually do? The mission statement is a classically obfuscated description that means nothing to me as an investor, much less a customer. I don't care about the 10-1-1 program. What does Crossgain do? And the "here's who's been visiting our site" box is just plain offensive, to me anyways.<p>

But the <a href="http://www.lightsurf.com/about/about.htm">LightSurf</a> summary is loud and clear. I get it. I can see that Phillipe Kahn (who has been in this business longer than most) at least has someone on the ball as far as getting his message out.<p>

So, in the interest of making things clear for the 98% of us who are not tuned into the grapevine in the Valley, why should we care about Crossgain?<p>

Cheers, Ralph Hempel P.Eng.
