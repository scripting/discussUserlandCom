It makes more sense? I have trouble with that. It's called investment."<p>

Yes, and sometimes it's time to write off an investment. The
house gets too big or too small. The old car needs too many
repairs to keep alive. The old computer gets too slow. Did
the investment serve you well? I would expect that it has.<p>

Would you prefer Microsoft to release all their XML-related
source code, or source code for their old hypertext format,
WinHelp? There's a lot of investment in WinHelp, too. A lot
of people might like WinHelp source code. Would it be
very useful moving forward? Not at all.<p>

"Do you realize how many braincells know how to use that OS?
Sure, Apple likes to say that Mac OS X Server has the Mac
look and feel, but what a lie that is. It's NextStep with a few
gratuitous bitmaps slapped on it to make it look superficially
like a Mac."<p>

Dave, I'm not talking about MacOSX Server. I'm talking about
OS X, which should have a much more Mac-like UI, will run
'Carboned' MacOS software, have less Unix exposed, etc.<p>

Server doesn't have a very Mac-like UI, you're right. But
I don't think Apple was shooting to duplicate the MacUI
for the first release of OSX Server, and they certainly
aren't claiming that they have. And this is also why they're
not pushing OSX Server as a general MacOS replacement. What
they did come up with is a lot more palatable to a Mac user
than straight NextStep, and probably a lot easier than the
prior Unix OSes they've shipped.<p>

If OS X turns to have a sucky mishmash UI, then you'll be
correct. I don't expect that to happen. At the very minimum
I expect it to be much improved and more Mac-like.<p>

"Engineers worry about things like kernels and open and closed systems. I doubt if many Mac users do."<p>

Then why should they care which OS is opened up?<p>

(And by the way, there's a very good chance that PowerComputing
machines will end up being able to run OS X and OS X Server,
thanks to the source being available.)
