The idea of lots of internal news channels inside a corporation is very hot. Like I said, we didn't think people would tune into this (sorry for the pun) for a while longer. The easier it is for users to create the channels the better. Our plan is to provide a simple outliner for this kind of stuff, real end-user software, and have it connect to a server. At first that server would be my.userland.com. Then we expected when corporate types saw how cool it was, they'd beat down our doors to license the server software too. I guess we're on Internet time. We're going to huddle on this. Keep posting your ideas if you want, I find this thread (as you can probably tell) very interesting. Dave
