In the same way, just have an applet work as an editor for the 'body' field in your web mail site. </i><p>

Then there's information in the html forms, and in the java applet.<p>

So do they submit twice?  <p>

Or once from the page and the applet sends the text as it dies?
Or from the applet and try to get the web page context?<p>

I've downloaded your applet already, is there a text area somewhere on the web where it's used? (So I can take a quick look)
