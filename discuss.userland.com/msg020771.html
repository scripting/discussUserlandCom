<ul><li>
Small - I want the central part of the keyboard only. No function keys, no inverted t, no keypad. (Your basic early powerbook layout). Basically, this lets the mouse be as close to the keyboard as possible.
</li>
<li>
Tactile - It needs to click or have good mechanical action. The early pc keyboards are good, as were some of the apple extended keyboard 2's and some of the original adb keyboards. (which I'm using at work. keyboard from '89, on a g4.)
</li><li>
Control key - where the cals lock is. Between tab and shift. Because I use Emacs, and I never use the caps lock key.
</li><li>
Arrow keys - in a line where they used to be on powerbooks. Full size, not like those dinky ones on the iBook, apple usb keyboards, or th pismo. When they are in a line, you can have 4 fingers on them and go any direction without moving a finger.
</li><li>
Command key the size of a normal key on the RHS of the space bar, next to the arrow keys. This is primarily for hitting cmd <- in a web browser.
</li><p>

I'm torn about the split style, I've tried it and it's kind of nice, but it's a lot of real estate for me. And I haven't found one with a good action yet. (I should post a pic of my workstation, 3 keyboards, many mice, three computers)  I tend to like 2 mice / computer, one on each side of the keyboard. It helps control rsi for me. <p>
