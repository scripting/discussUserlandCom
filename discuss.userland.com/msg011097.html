Someone directs a request for your content through their server, where they add material to it that you may or may not approve of, without asking your permission. They then return this *modified* material to the requester.<p>

If their server is on their own domain, they are obviously creating a derivative work without permission--which violates your copyright to the material.<p>

How is it any different when, instead of providing a public link via their own site, they install a proxy server to make the *same set of changes* to the page on a number of individual users' local machines? The user still sees *the same modified material*. For all practical purposes, the third party (in this case, Third Voice) is *publishing* a *derivative work*. Furthermore, Third Voice gains (in reputation) from the derivative work--another no-no.<p>

The fact that the users who see the modified page had a choice in which to view is irrelevant. Just because one can choose to read the original publisher's edition of a book instead of a xerox-pirated reproduction of it doesn't make the pirate copy any less illegal.<p>

If, on the other hand, I do the same thing locally, but do not make the modified material widely available to others, it looks like fair use to me.<p>
