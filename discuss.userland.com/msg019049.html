It is not so much a content management system as a templating/content rendering engine.  It's also apparently very similar to things you can do with JSP/Custom Tag Libraries.<p>

While Tea looks like an interesting templating language, I don't see the value in yet-another-templating language.  Is there a compelling feature in there that hasn't been done elsewhere in the Java Server-side world?<p>

I must say I'm impressed with the implementation and documentation.  The authors should be proud of their work.<p>
