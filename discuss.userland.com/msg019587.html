Although I didn't check I assumed that there were non-Time-Warner titles in the search engine.<p>

BTW, I think the bigger story is why none of the reporters who read the original two pieces or the Scripting News commentary thought the story was relevant. Clearly it was, it's going to be used in an RIAA case. I guess I have absolutely no credibility with the press, not enough for them to even click on a link and use their minds. That I find totally depressing. At least Ryan Tate doesn't mind getting a lead from me.<p>

What's going on over there in PressLand? How many clues does it take?
