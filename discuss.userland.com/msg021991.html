A three-line <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/frontierCallingManilaSoap.gif">script that reads</a> the Scripting News home page, via SOAP 1.1. The SOAP interfaces are now deployed on UserLand servers. They'll go out as an update tonight, and the new docs will go up tonight too. By tomorrow it will be (fingers crossed) possible to write a Java app using <a href="http://xml.apache.org/soap/">IBM's SOAP</a> to edit any "Manila" site. To our knowledge, Manila is the first full Web app to support SOAP. If you want to watch the progress of the release, check out Brent's <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/11/19.html">weblog</a>. I'll link to all the new goodies first thing tomorrow morning. <br><br><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/goreLaughing.gif" height="48" width="40" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="3" align="left"><a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/bostonGlobeJuxtaposition.gif"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/happyDubya.gif" height="176" width="82" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="5" align="right"></a>Is it my imagination or is CNN <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/cnnSpinningBushVictory.gif">spinning</a> a Bush victory? As if saying "Enough, we're tired of covering this story, and are wanting to wind it down." Even the Boston Globe is <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/evenTheBostonGlobeIsEasyonD.gif">easin up</a> on Dubya. They were <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/bostonGlobeJuxtaposition.gif">not so</a> easy last weekend. Ira Cary Blanco <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/dubyaZzTop.gif">caught</a> GW on CNN wearing a ZZ Top hat.<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/19/politics/19COUN.html">NY Times</a>: "In Palm Beach County, the vote recount crawled on with a gain of 12 votes for Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Gore had hoped to pick up a significant number of votes in this Democratic stronghold." <i>Ooops!</i><br><br>Rael Dornfest of O'Reilly supplied some missing info, and now the <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$173">sample scripts</a> I uploaded yesterday read news items from Meerkat into the Frontier or Radio object database. <br><br>I've been approved as a <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Arts/Television/Programs/Game_Shows/Gong_Show,_The/">category</a> editor for The Gong Show on DMOZ. They sent a link to their <a href="http://dmoz.org/guidelines.html">guidelines</a> page. Fascinating reading. If you have good Gong Show links, send them to me. I'm official.<br><br>Authoring a directory is a lot like maintaining a weblog. On a weblog you post on a timely basis, but links fall off the bottom. On a directory you save the valuable non-time-based links. There's the fundamental difference between a weblog and a directory. A weblog has the current stuff, and a directory has the permanent stuff. Connecting the two structures is an interesting user interface problem, and a social one. I have to prime the pump, to get people interested in doing their own directories, I guess I have to create directory envy.<br><br>Anyway, soon I expect to have a new directory to stand alongside the Scripting News weblog. It'll work better than the one I <a href="http://directory.userland.com/weblogs/index.html">did</a> during the summer. (Directories are going to be a Manila feature, edited in Radio in OPML, the content will be portable, a directory browser should be easily implemented in any programmable server environment. No lock-in, just good tools and robust protocols.)<br><br>Oy, that might be confusing. Let me try again. You'll be able to view my directory in a Web browser (<a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/sneakPreviewNewManilaFeatur.gif">teaser</a>), which is the way most people will access it; or you can get the XML to include my content in your directory, no matter what software is used to render it. <br><br>Now if you recall my writing about baseball and philosophy, it would be only natural to assume that I would want to explore the philosophy of The Gong Show. It surely had one. But we have plenty of time to explore that. While you're pondering what I'm pondering, study up on <a href="http://members.tripod.com/wrcw/Short_Biography.htm">Chuck Barris</a>, who was to The Gong Show as Casey Stengel was to The Mets. <br><br><a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/11/18">Dan Gillmor</a> is back in China with some great pictures. <br><br>Is an upgrade <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/egroupsUpgradeComing.gif">coming</a> at eGroups? I want to know if the guy with the wrench is Murphy.<br><br>Tech note: You can add a Thanksgiving <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/turkey.gif">turkey</a> to your UserLand-hosted Manila site by including the word "turkey" in quotes.<br><br><a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/tellTheTruth">A meta-survey</a>. It's OK to lie.<br><br>
