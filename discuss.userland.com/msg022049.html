And he's opinionated too. That's the way to go. Oh no, he's a Yankees fan. <a href="http://www.scripting.com/wavs/fargo5.wav">Oh geez</a>. Meanwhile <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com">Sheila</a> is counting the days to spring training. Didn't we just finish the World Series? Are we really going to do this again?<br><br><a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/uncle.html">Tonight's song</a>: "Come hear Uncle John's Band by the river side.

It's coffee-time, and catch up on what's new. <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/adam@curry.com/rss/html/curryCom.html">Adam asks</a> me to send him a bill. He picked up on my "tip jars are for tips" quote in Fortune yesterday. Where does Salon dig up stories like <a href="http://www.salon.com/sex/world/2001/01/12/airplane/index.html?CP=RDF&DN=310">this</a>? A <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article.asp?aid=37642">product</a> I've been waiting for. O'Reilly posted the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/p2p2001/pub/w/125">schedule</a> for the P2P conference next month. I'm speaking twice, on the Two-Way-Web and on amateur journalism. <a href="http://www.peterme.com/">Peterme</a> rants back at Dale: "Journalists don't actually know anything." <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/results/dave@userland.com/desktopWebsitesSurvey">Surprising results</a> from yesterday's survey. A majority of the participants have a server on their desktop machine. Glad I asked! Wow.<br><br>	This is a programming weekend for me. I'm going to take care of lots of little loose-ends in our Desktop Website project. We've got a nice user base testing the stuff. Everyone's using it differently. Our prefs system is really easy to work with, so I'm going to (try to) give everyone what they want.<br><br>	<a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$4389#4596">Adam Curry</a>: "If you use MSIE5 on a Mac, whenenever you request a page from localhost, click to another app or the desktop, this will allow the page to load. It is stupid and sucks, but you get used to it after a while and at least it works."<br><br>
