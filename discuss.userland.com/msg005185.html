Most of them, though, have names that tell me nothing about their content.<p>

So I feel obligated to subscribe to all of them, to check them out.<p>

This involves an acceleratingly long page of checkboxes, which include both new ones I've never seen, and old ones I tried and didn't like.<p>

My memory isn't that good!<p>

And even if it were, I'd still end up with a very, very slow loading page of tables in a different order, which I have to read and memorize and then go back to the checkboxes page to unsubscribe the losers...<p>

My suggestion:<p>

Include the headlines themselves on the checkboxes page.<p>

Have three status-values:  new, selected, and rejected.<p>

Show the headlines for the first two statuses, not the third.<p>


People whose browsers are slow at rendering complex tables could use this page as their main page, as well.
