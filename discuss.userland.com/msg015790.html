Thanks for all the time you've put into all this -- whether in thought, keystrokes, or software -- it's all honest and good, and that's why those of us who come here [and have for years] continue to do so.<p>

And a big YES to PIKE!!! <b>Damn</b>... makes me wonder why nobody thought of that before?!! It's a hand-coder's dream to have outlining functionality in an html authoring environment, and actually feels quite natural. And to me, it's much faster than the regular ETP method - which is an added plus!  <p>

Heh, now I know why the UserLand cow is just a skull: you've got that cow brain soaking in a vat of LSD somewhere, hooked up to a toaster and an old TI-15, giving you *visions* of cool software that we all need in random led patterns!<p>

Seriously, kudos to you, Brent, and all the Userland crew on that effort - beta or not.  It's gonna be cool to see how PIKE develops from here out!<p>

PS... and I'll be working again on <a href="http://mmd.weblogs.com/">mmd.weblogs.com</a> this weekend, and I'm glad to get some feedback!
