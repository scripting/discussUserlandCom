This is a real help. Thanks, Phil for the insights.<p>

So, here's an interesting distinction. The stuff developed in a technography session is created by consensus. Everyone is reading it as it is generated. Everyone is helping to organize it and integrate it into a whole. This is what makes technography seem like magic, because it takes individual input and brings it into the consensual understanding. This leads to the after-meeting discussion group challenge. The stuff generated in the DG does not reflect the consensus. It has yet to be woven back in to the common knowledge base. We need a technology and a process that will help make that happen. Here's where on-line technography could perhaps help.<p>
