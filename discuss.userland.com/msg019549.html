is this the same artist formerly known as the artist formerly known as prince who warned fans in july 1999 <i>"not to let the Internet get out of control and take over the world as an evil force"</i>...?<p>

<i>"Don't be fooled by the Internet," he said. "Use the computer -- don't let the computer use you. Y'all all saw The Matrix."</i>

i admit this quote is a little bit out of context. certainly, prince ranted about the major music labels on the same occasion. however, i am curious if he still has such a movie-inspired-conspiracy-theory-driven idea of the net (can't get through to the royal website either)...
