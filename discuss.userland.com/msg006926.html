We leave little bits of cruft in the membership database and don't worry about it. Someday we'll write a script that sweeps thru the database and removes all the accounts that haven't been accessed in a certain period of time. That's how your old membership table will be deleted. Any other approach would require us to allow you delete a membership table and we'd rather not do that.
