Maybe <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,37256,00.html">this Wired article</A> talks about what he was referring to?  <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>AOL is about to become the world's largest content company. Along with its more than 22 million subscribers, merger partner Time Warner has well over 120 million combined subscribers for its magazines and cable services. Also on the consolidation train is Warner Music, a division of Time Warner, and EMI, a major music label. ...<p>

On Tuesday, AOL said that it would add InterTrust's InterRights Point security client to future versions of AOL's promotional CDs. ...<p>

The InterTrust security system provides an end-to-end solution for retailers. Using a technology called Digibox, businesses can determine how, when, and what they will sell by programming the information into the security software. Since the platform is not content specific, any file can be wrapped in this secure format. This should appeal to AOL as it begins selling video and audio content.</BLOCKQUOTE>
