I'm glad someone is addressing the usability of the Web (thanks Dave!
;^)~.<p>

I emailed Dave once before asking him why the DG just didn't use
NNTP, since you can use your editor of choice with it, there are
a million readers with many desirable threading features, and it
is an open standard. I'll let Dave give his exact words, but it
was something along the lines of 'I didn't know about it'.<p>

Bruce Tognazzinni of <A HREF="http://www.asktog.com">asktog</A>
has a lot to say about the giant steps backward in usability
which came about with the Web. In a lot of cases he states it is
because the folks designing the Web have had no Usability
training, and have not been exposed to the lessons of the
past. I think the momentum behind this phenomenon is something
we can't fight, so rather than try to get everybody using NNTP
for DGs, for instance, finding new ways to make the tools usable
is much needed. So once again, thanks.<p>

Tog and others have also pointed out that a Web application is
not a Web browser with scripting enhancements. The ability to do
RPC over HTTP and write one's own front-end may represent a key
move away from the browser-is-web attitude. I look forward to
seeing more of this in the future.
