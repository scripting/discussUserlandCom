If you want to find "all" of the special RSS channels, you can just increment through the "list" by doing this:<p>

<a href="http://my.netscape.com/preview_channel.tmpl?services=net.260">http://my.netscape.com/preview_channel.tmpl?services=net.260</a><p>

and add or subtract from the "net.xxx"
there are some places where the numbers dont show channels (like they've been deleted)
But you can see the subscription screen for all of them using this method<p>


Like replacing .260 with 261 or with 230 (I think it starts at 230)
