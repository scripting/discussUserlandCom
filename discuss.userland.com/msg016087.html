Hmm, but contrast this with Pete's frustration in <a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$51">http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$51</a> <p>

<i>Is this similar to the Mac's User Interface Guidelines? </i><p>

That's the way I'm thinking, too.  Standards are a good thing. They make life easier for the user.
I'd rather have consistancy within the platform I use than ease of programming, and I think most users would agree.  And aren't users the important people in this conversation?  Hey, if I felt that users of my product were important, I might even have the word "user" somewhere in my company's name :-)<p>

That dosen't mean that skins are bad, by the way. As long as they don't, or at least the default doesn't, break user interface guidelines/standards then they're ok.  Heck, I change the look of RealJukebox all the time, because I like a smaller window with more compact buttons than the default.  No matter how small the window, though, Alt-F4 still exits the app.<p>
