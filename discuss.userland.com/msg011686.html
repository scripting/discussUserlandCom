(Wait a minute. Isn't Red Hat smoke and mirrors? Their market cap is $5.844 billion. What is their product? Hello.)<p>

Well, for starters, some of the best sysadmin utilities I've encountered on Unix. Sure, there are probably better -- the press glows about Caldera and Mandrake -- but RedHat's installation and configuration and management were lightyears ahead of ...<p>

For seconds -- how about a useful way to get updates? documentation? How about having a *usable* website?<p>

Hello? There's product *and* they've been (so far) putting their money back into the community.<p>
