Also, did you know these things:<p>

1) You will be able to "plug in" any service you want in place of or in addition to Netcenter. (for search, 404, etc. etc.)
2) What's related talks RDF (that's all it is really..) and you will be able to have other servers that can serve "what's related" as well - so you might have a "yahoo" what's related, a "userland" what's related, etc. etc.<p>

So while it might look like the browser is attached to the hip of the netcenter site, you will be able to "attach" it to any other site that you trust or talks that same rdf ..<p>


If you want to find out if the additional features that might get added would be in the "official" netscape branded release - I would recommend emailing Brendan Eich (<a href="mailto:brendan@netscape.com">brendan@netscape.com</a>)<p>


On another note - does it really matter if NS didn't include that feature in the "branded" release? It is just as possible to customize a Frontier version of Mozilla via mozilla.org (not having to go through "netscape" at all) that your users could download.<p>

I dont see how requiring users to get IE 5 to be much different from requiring users to get the "frontier" mod of mozilla.<p>

I'd even bet that if you chatted with Jamie Zawinski about how strongly you felt about getting xml-rpc in the official release that he would find out how feasable that is and possibly help push it as well (can't speak for him or any mozillan.<p>

Also - take a look at doczilla - they are a wholly independant group building an app on top of gecko - and arent beholden to Netscape at all, just using the mozilla code.<p>

Hey - you could even release your custom browser without the "what's related" stuff you object to.  <p>

Look at <a href="http://www.doczilla.com">http://www.doczilla.com</a><p>
