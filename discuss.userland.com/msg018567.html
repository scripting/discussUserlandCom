In a digital world where bits can (and should) be conveniently repurposed across varied media to suit the desires of the user (moi) - and repurposed automatically whenever possible (agents, etc) - I should pay once-only.<p>

Isn't it true that "valuing bits" appropriately is the entire crux of the Internet's business dilemma? This is true whether it has to do with pricing Frontier as a Web app (let alone Manila) as much as for CDs and MP3's.<p>

Now, I think I understand why. We're wrestling over something that is, at the same time, incredibly abstract (e.g., "bits") and yet as practical as Napster. Let's face it - even we techies are quarreling over the terms. No wonder that perfectly intelligent others are confused.<p>

Hey, bravo. I'm sure others have caught this but I had missed it entirely.<p>
