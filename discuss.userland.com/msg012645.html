I meant
the format that almost all of the channels on my.userland.com use --
I believe it's RSS, which is an application of RDF, correct?<p>

At some point, generating a version of scripting news that adheres to
RSS would be great -- it's ironic that the page that got me excited
about RSS in the first place doesn't support it itself.<p>

Thanks,
Ken
