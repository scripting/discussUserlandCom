If you know someone who reads DaveNet via email, please send them a pointer. <br><br>	It's an important piece, imho, but I no longer wish to distribute essays via email. I want to be able to edit as the day goes by, as I do with Scripting News, because I expect to learn a lot as people read it. I want DaveNet to become a way for me to write whitepapers that have more lasting value. <br><br><b>FAQ</b><br><br>	Mike Seaman: "Do you really believe that it is possible to create a viable business (BrowserCo) as you described it? Where would it get its revenue from, given that people are used to getting their browser for free and are (it seems to me) pretty unlikely to be willing to start paying?"<br><br>	Answer: They would be free to go anywhere they want. Think about a browser tightly integrated with Linux, intelligently, thoughtfully, around a vision of the Two Way Web. They could also compete with Yahoo, who desperately needs competition. <br><br><b>Themes</b><br><br>	Last night Themes shipped!

I think I've got them all. Please have another read and post a report.<br><br>	The number one FAQ is What is RSS an <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/06/17/ILoveAcronyms">acronym</a> for? Good question. On every revision it's stood for something different. It started life as a dialect of RDF, Netscape was the leading proponent of RDF in W3C, but when Guha left, the interest waned. So I'm pretty sure that the R stood for RDF. And I think the two S's stood for Site and Summary.<br><br>	Then in the second rev, with RDF behind them, the R was changed to stand for Rich. Why rich? Sounds pretty Microsofty to me. So I think it should stand for Really. Or maybe realllllly? It's easier than Rich. ";->"<br><br>	Then what about the two S's?<br><br>	Well, seems to me that one of the S's should stand for Syndication, because that's what the format is for. Right?<br><br>	And then what does everyone say about RSS? <br><br>	It's really simple.<br><br>	And there you have it.<br><br>	You decide<br><br>	Survey: <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/whatDoesRssStandFor">What does RSS stand for?</a><br><br><b>More serious notes</b><br><br>	<a href="http://writetheweb.com/read.php?item=28">Edd Dumbill</a>: "Things currently look like there may well be two threads of development: an 'RSS2' format, and a longer-term effort to provide useful, practical applications of RDF that work well over the Web--hopefully learning from the success of RSS."<br><br>	<a href="http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$22">Jason Levine highlights</a> the portions of Scripting News that don't appear in the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/xml/rss.xml">RSSization</a> of Scripting News.<br><br><b>Microsoft pointers</b><br><br>	Cameron Barrett: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$17642">A World Without Microsoft</a>.<br><br>	WSJ: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/417877.asp">Microsoft damaged its own credibility in court</a>.<br><br>	<a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/quicklinks/">MacWEEK</a> has an excellent collection of links on Microsoft.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/editorial/08thu1.html">NY Times editorial</a>: "Judge Jackson sided completely with the government in part because he mistrusts the company." <br><br>	<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/opinion/A18524-2000Jun7.html">Washington Post editorial</a>: "Judge Jackson has alleviated the time problem somewhat by imposing interim restrictions on Microsoft's business practices.
