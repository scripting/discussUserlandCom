I didn't put Frontier through distribution because we tried that and it didn't work. <p>

I also didn't sell it to a gorilla, although I've had chances to. They would just dismember it, and its the integration of features that makes the software work.<p>

And the next release, the one for music, is going to scratch a lot of other people's itches. I told Bierman today that this product is forever going to change UserLand. It will, more than Manila did.<p>

And the timing is great because we're going right into the middle of a debate about money. At some point I will raise the question, if you can get paid for your art (the musicians) perhaps I can too?<p>

We have our own RIAA in the software business, and some of it comes from people who say they're our friends. They may not even know they're making it so tough for us.<p>

Also, it's sure that software is going to get Napsterized. There's nothing that will stop it. This may shake up this industry enough for the rules to change. At the end of the process, I suspect we will have Larry Wall, and other identifiable leaders of developer groups, that act more like bands and less like companies. Because that's the reality of software, movements don't make software, corporations don't make software, people make software. Keep it simple and thanks for listening.
