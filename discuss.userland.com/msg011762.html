Still diggin' reminds me of a video I watched yesterday. It was an Australian comedy called <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0118826">The Castle</a><p>

It's about the Kerrigan family who stand up to big business when there house is to be knocked down to make way for airport extensions.<p>

The Kerrigans live next to the airport, but love their home. They are always making extensions to it, most of which are unfinished or pending. A great quote (in context) by one of the boys is: "I dug a hole"<p>

Rather than seeing this as just a hole in the ground, the father uses it as an excuse to build a patio. <p>

Anyway, The Castle is a great film about a family that just goes on diggin'<p>

Check it out if you like Aussie humour<p>
