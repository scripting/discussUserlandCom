I've learned that you can do something in an instant
that will give you a heartache for life.<p>

I've learned that it's taking me a long time to
become the person I want to be.<p>

I've learned that it's a lot easier to react
than it is to think.<p>

 I've learned that you should always leave
 loved ones with loving words. It may be the last time you see them.<p>

I've learned that you can keep going long after you think you can't.<p>

I've learned that we are responsible for what we do,
 no matter how we feel.<p>

I've learned that either you control your attitude or it controls
you.<p>

I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy
a relationship is at first, the passion fades and
there had better be something else to take its place.<p>

I've learned that learning to forgive takes practice.<p>

I've learned that there are people who love you dearly,
but just don't know how to show it.<p>

I've learned that my best friend and I can do anything
or nothing and have the best time.<p>

I've learned that sometimes the people you expect to
kick you when you're down will be the ones to help
you get back up.<p>

I've learned that sometimes when I'm angry
I have the right to be angry,
but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel.<p>

I've learned that true friendship continues to grow
even over the longest distance.
Same goes for true love.<p>

I've learned that just because someone doesn't love you
  the way you want them to doesn't mean they don't love
 you with all they have.<p>

 I've learned that no matter how much I care,
 some people just don't care back.
 
 I've learned that maturity has more to do with what types
 of experiences you've had and what you've learned from
 them and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated.<p>

I've learned that your family won't always be there for you.
It may seem funny,
but people you aren't related to can take care of you and
love you and teach you to trust people again.
Families aren't biological.<p>

I've learned that no matter how good a friend someone is,
they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you
must forgive them for that.<p>

I've learned that no matter how bad your heart is broken the
world doesn't stop for your grief.<p>

I've learned that our background and circumstances may have
influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.<p>

I've learned that just because two people argue,
it doesn't mean they don't love each other.
And just because they don't argue,
 it doesn't mean they do.<p>

I've learned that it takes years to build up trust,
and only seconds to destroy it.<p>

I've learned that we don't have to change friends if we
understand that friends change.<p>

 I've learned that you shouldn't be so eager to find out a secret.
 It could change your life forever.
I've learned that it's not what you have in your life
but who you have in your life that counts.<p>

I've learned that two people can look at the exact same
thing and see something totally different.<p>

I've learned that you cannot make someone love you.
All you can do is be someone who can be loved.
The rest is up to them.<p>

I've learned that there are many ways of falling
and staying in love.<p>

I've learned that no matter the consequences,
those who are honest with themselves, get farther in life.<p>

I've learned that no matter how many friends you have,
if you are their pillar,
you will feel lonely and lost at the times you need them most.<p>

I've learned that even when you think you have no more to give,
when a friend cries out to you,
you will find the strength to help.<p>

I've learned that writing,
as well as talking,
can ease emotional pains.<p>

I've learned that the people you care most about in
life are taken from you too soon.<p>

I've learned that it's hard to determine where to
draw the line between being nice and not hurting
people's feelings and standing up for what you believe<p>
