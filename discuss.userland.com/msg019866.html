esr has left a bad taste in many people's mouths with his antics, mine included.  I do not like a lot of what he stands for.  I disagree with the way he promotes free software.  I could go on, but I won't.<p>

<i>Since the Open Source community takes a highly moral position, these things must be examined carefully, and processes opened up where ever possible, and tough questions asked, and if no answers are provided that must be understood.</i><p>

Perhaps I'm missing something, but I always thought that esr's "Open Source" movement wanted to present a purly pragmatic apology for releasing source code.  It was my understanding that he was trying to avoid the idealism of rms.  If this is not the case -- if "Open Source" is a moral stance on the issues -- then I would agree that some close examination needs to happen.<p>

<i>The GNU agreement is impossible for an honorable developer who does both commercial and open source software to use.</i><p>

I would agree.  This, unfortunatly, makes me dishonorable.  Hopefully, I can escape this delima (how to feed my family and remain true to ideals I have) soon -- my contract is about to expire and I'm looking for new work.  I'm looking for system administration work so I won't be paid to develop software.  (A lot of the creators of free software make their livings as sysadmins.  Is this the ideal?  No, but we've got quite a ways to go before we get to what I would call ideal.)<p>

<i>We could build quite a list of ethical issues for open source advocates, and in doing so, help clear up the contradictions, and find out who really is working for open source, and who's a naked emperor, and then we know who to work with. </i><p>

I'd love to do this.<p>

The number one issue I see is that esr has put himself in position as spokesperson for a movement and tried to make an idealistic movement totally amoral and pragmatic.  He also tries to sell his pro-gun, libertarian beliefs as a bundle with "open source".  He has made a lot of people on both sides of the issue angry by doing this.<p>

Then there are those who whine about the particular licenseing scheme people use.  There are some real issues that need to be <i>discussed</i> but some people just want to complain because so and so released his software under a license they don't like.  No one can tell me (or you) how to release my software.<p>

I would bet, though, that you have put more thought into this than I have.  What are some of the ethical issues you see?
