people to use a nasty adjective like "closed" for our software.</I><p>

The word "closed" is the exact opposite of the word "open." When a door is not closed, it is open. When a door is not open, it is closed.<p>

When software and APIs are not "open", then they are "closed".<p>

Perhaps a better word would be "proprietary", though it perhaps has even more negative connotations that "closed". No matter what you look at it, software and APIs that force a developer to use a proprietary ["closed"] technology or protocol are not a good thing.
