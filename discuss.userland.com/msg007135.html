Why wouldn't I put an XML-RPC call in a web page? If that call returns something to the browser that it can render am I not using XML-RPC as a kind of "high(er) level URI for a cgi script"? This then is a kind of distributed object system no?</i><p>

XML-RPC is a way for your machine to to get the result of a script on another machine. So yes, you could have some kind of server side logic (XSSI perhaps), call an XML-RPC client (like the perl client) to fetch the result of an XML-RPC call.<p>

The catch is - xml doesn't contain html tagged text bery nicely here. So you'd be better of having you XML-RPC call return a value (or list of values), and using your server side script to generate the html.<p>

Its better for many reasons that way.<p>

So the short answer is - no you don't want to just include the result from an XML-RPC call into your webpage. You want to use the data returned from this XML-RPC session to gernerate html for your webpage.<p>

This is all assuming you want the browser to wait for you to establish another http connection, so you can build your page, before you send your page.<p>

I hope I made sense.
