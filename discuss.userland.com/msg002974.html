<b> How to address a website table out of a gdb</b>
which is not at top level.<p>

The convention for easy addressing is to name the top-level table inside a gdb after the gbd. This is a great feature.<p>

What I miss is the elegant mapping of tables to web via doctree we had with the initial responder structure. With the current mainresponder, the doctree can only be a single entry, not a table of addresses.<p>

It would be great to have both worlds. Arguments for that:
<li>Not everyone has easy access to DNS configs</li>
<li>DNS changes take time to propagate throughout the net</li>
<li>One sub-domain may need different entry points into a gdb</li>
<li>Same flexibility with domains and pathes</li><p>
