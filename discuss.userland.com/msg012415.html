<I>Dave, I'm going to have guess that you misunderstood the last paragraph, I don't think Paul was ranting about these sites' brands as vacuous - he says "like" Salon* after all. We'll have to ask him.</I><p>

I'm glad you understood me. I should have clarified by saying that I see Salon* (it helps to be first, I guess!) as <I>helping</I> the four honchos legitimately build their brands by increasing the distribution of their substance.<p>

So what I'm really ranting about is the extent to which it seems that the mad rush to establish a "brand" in cyberspace has led to idiocy like Amazon's suit against Barnes and Noble, and the fact that, <I>instantly</I> upon someone concatenating four business' names in the public sphere, there's weeping, wailing, and gashing of teeth over whether this is acceptable or not, rather than over anything substantive like: does this help or harm the audience? Does this help or harm the four honchos? What usability issues need to be addressed by presentation of syndicated content?<p>

Note that I'm not claiming that those conversations aren't happening or won't happen; I'm just asserting that those conversations should probably precede (or, more accurately, subsume) the brand-safety conversation.<p>

Thanks for the opportunity to explain,<br>
Paul
