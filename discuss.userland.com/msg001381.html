It seems you might want to pre-open databases for applications that aren't web servers.<p>

Now I have a beach-head right at the beginning of the startup process. That's a very interesting place to put code.<p>

The new startup code is running on nirvana.userland.com now. <p>

I figure that stats will fit in fine in user.webserver, not sure about domains, for now.<p>
