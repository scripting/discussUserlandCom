Start with the "executive summary", and
if you liked that, read the "tomorrow" and "analysis" chapters.<p>

Btw, here's another Napster-related quote:<p>

<blockquote>
"[...] Some technologies create a new way of using existing
copyrighted works. These technologies give rise to the 'new
use' question: does the new use of an existing copyrighted
work infringe the author's rights? [...] Almost invariably,
the arguments over new uses take the same form each time.
Copyright owners argue that if others are making money from
their works, they deserve a share.  Those making the
new use argue that their use only advertises or extends the
copyrighted works to a wider audience and so should not be
burdened with a royalty obligation.  Just as invariably, the
arguments overlook the central —and largely unanswerable-
question: will the new use eventually grow to supplant
the old use? If it will, there are strong arguments that
royalty payments will be needed to preserve incentives.
If it will not, those arguments are much weaker."
