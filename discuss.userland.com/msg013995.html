I wouldn't have bothered you with this report today, but you mentioned a similar report on Scripting News.<p>

Dave, I just saw the "disappearing stories problem" for the first time. I flipped my homepage on <a href="http://carpediem.editthispage.com">Carpe Diem</a> a couple of hours ago, made an update or two and viewed the results in my browser. A few minutes ago, I noticed that Carpe Diem wasn't listed on the <a href="http://www.editthispage.com/updates">Updates</a> page, and when I went to my site the homepage was back on December 31. I manually restored my update. Hmmm..</a>
