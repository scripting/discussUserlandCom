Aaaaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!! Don't tell me that's old joke still kicking around! What a FIASCO! <p>

CORBA is DEAD. Remember Open Doc? That was the last hope CORBA had of getting a gui, and it's flushed down the toilet of history. <p>

Fresco was something like three generations behind Open Doc -- it was the great object oriented C++ toolkit that was going to save the world from the X Toolkit. Guess what -- it didn't. <p>

I can't believe anyone's still beating that dead old horse. <p>

CORBA is a big overblown joke that's not even funny any more. If you're still cheerleading for it, in the hopes that it might be a useful weapon in the war to vanquish Microsoft (as the linux cheerleaders put it), then the joke's on you. <p>

OK, maybe CORBA's not "stone age", but it's just SOOOO early 1990's. Remember back when everybody thought that C++ was going to save the computer industry?<p>
