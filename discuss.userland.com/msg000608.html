(I wish this had worked last week, because I could have avoided a misunderstanding with the liberal application of <humor> tags within the
<body> of a poorly composed message.)<p>

I'm not sure why I'm so fired up about XML, but it feels like
a historic golden spike that will let a lot of systems talk to each
other. One odd example is this: Last time I went to the doctor
they had me fill in the standard insurance form. Of course,
the form asked for things that were not on my insurance card,
(or were there under a different name)
and the card contained info not requested by the form. 
I can imagine one day letting the Doctor 'scan' my card, and the
computer can then figure out what goes where. Not a huge
application, but it would be nice.
