I won't even try to pretend that I was the judge in that case.  I will say, however, that if the questions were allowed at all, the judge at the time considered them relevant -- or at least, "allowed them" into testimony.  Whether or not the judge should have allowed that questioning is inconsequential:  clinton was ordered to answer those questions (about his fidelity), and apparently he did so.
