Usually, it is a very short time between the thought "this could be a hoax" crossing one's cerebral cortex, to the conclusion "this is a hoax".</i><p>

I'm sorry, but as bizarre as it is, I have to assure you that this is NOT a hoax. As you may have seen from today's Scripting News, my company and I are heavily involved in this project, and it's totally real.<p>

See this month's Wired Magazine for more details.<p>

If you, um... make a stink about this, and try to convince too many people that it's a hoax, you're going to regret it when people start buying the boxes and proving you wrong (surely SOMEBODY out there will buy a box!) <b>This is NOT a hoax.</b><p>
