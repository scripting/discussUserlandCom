That's a mystery for me.. :) What I can't figure out is where is that Internet company signing all the big names away from the record labels and offering them better deals? Isnt this one of those business models that could easily be justified for VCs as a loss-leader to create brand (only half kidding here, I guess :)? As they say <i>we'll sell below cost, but we'll make up for it in volume</i> ... :)<p>

If its so bad for artists and consumers, why hasnt this happened yet? In other words, for all the bitching and moaning, where's the beef?<p>

For how long do artists have to sign up with a label to receive a break-even zero dollars as Courtney Love computes? Something here sure does not add up.
