The XML-RPC interface docs on userland.com state I can't include the character < in a string type member!  = should be on the list too BTW!<p>

So how can I put HTML in an XML Request member??<p>

Here's what happened when I experimented anyway: <p>

As a baseline here's what the HTML version of MTTF can do when putting HTML tags in the body of a message:<p>

1) You can type in <b>tags</b> like this and they store fine.  You can view your message and it will appear with the tags in the body.<p>

2) You can type in <img src="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/yadayada"> tags and they store/view fine too.<p>

Of course the mail client doesn't interpret cause the HTML version of MTTF isn't setting mimeType to text/html<p>


Now this is what happens when putting HTML in the message body of a msgStruct using MTTF XML-RPC calls:<p>

--- Without <string></string> data type qualifiers in the msgStruct<p>

1) <b>tags</b> like this make it through the XML-RPC routine, but when viewed with the HTML version of MTTF the tags are STRIPPED!<p>

2) <img src="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/anything"> tags blow up the XML-RPC routine with a fault code of 6 and fault string of "poorly formed xml text, string constant is improperly formatted (at character #357)<p>

This character refers to random places in the XML request after the body member.  Probably because it goes to lunch somewhere around the "=" sign.<p>


--- With <string></string> data type qualifiers in the msgStruct
1) <b>tags</b> like this make it through the XML-RPC routine, but when viewed with the HTML version of MTTF the message body says "table - 1 item"!<p>

2) <img src="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/anything" - Same result as without <string> declartion... blows up the XML-RPC routine with a fault code of 6 and fault string of "poorly formed xml text, string constant is improperly formatted (at character #357)<p>

The results are strange, and shouldn't really yield these different results.  <p>

But the real question is still How do we upload HTML via XML-RPC?  Maybe a <html> data type is needed?<p>
