His <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/weblogs/index.html">Weblog FAQ</a> is at is a good overview with lots of tips and resources. His article <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/web/value.html">How to Add Value to your Links</a> is a good starting point for anyone who wants to develop their weblogging style. <p>

Although I don't adhere to his preferred style, I have found both to be very useful.<p>
