Two of the common themes seem to be "digital paper" and very-high resolution tablets<p><p>
<p><p>
Digital paper is used to make complete several hundred page blank books that can be "downloaded" to, carried off to the beach, and read just like a paperback.  They use a very paper-like feeling page interwoven with conductors and some kind of "firm" memory-like pixels that don't need power to stay on or off.<p><p>
<p><p>
High resolution tablets are more like traditional flat panel displays.  About the size of a letter-size pad of paper, with very high (144dpi or greater) resolution.<p><p>
<p><p>
In both cases, it's the very high resolution and clear, black-on-white text that makes them easy and comfortable to read.
