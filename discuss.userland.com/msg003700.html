I wonder if this is even possible with Bill Gates at the helm.  He has repeatedly empasized in many ways and many forums that Windows is <i>the</i> core product of MS.  Their apps are there to increase the Window's marketshare.<p>

What is interesting about this strategy, of course, is that MS has <i>not</i> always followed this to the letter.  Witness all of the apps written for the Macintosh and the (very) few token Unix apps.<p>

Still who in Microsoft feels brave enough to suggest that they jetison their long running (and until now, proven) strategy?
