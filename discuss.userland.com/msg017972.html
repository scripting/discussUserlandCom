Weirdly, 80% of the crowd had come to hear a cool swing band (they were cool, but I can't remember their name ...). Most stuck around to hear Dylan but seemed more curious than into him.<p>

My eldest son and myself sidled our way to within 20 feet of the stage where the most intense of the Dylan groupies had grouped. He and his brother (my sons, that is) have a cool, developing band, produced by Armand Petri of Google Doll fame, with roots in Dylan, blues, rock and gospel ... talking to them about doing a Manila site.<p>

Dylan always was and remains rather hideously homely if not even more so. Who cares? For this guy who listened to him when I was just turning teen and he was still using a folk guitar, he has been one of very few "superstars" who have consistently had something to say for 30 years. You don't always agree with him across the journey but so what to that?<p>

(I.E., Dylan has "content" in the webbish sense of the term). Which is better than style - no, which is style, in the end.<p>

Now, how do we get him to speak out on the revolution that the music biz needs?<p>
