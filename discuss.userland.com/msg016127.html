<i><font color="blue">I can't see it replacing a good tool like dreamweaver, the editor work like the old version. I think the more important thing is that it can be incorporated into dreamweaver.</font></i><p>

I don't use Dreamweaver as an HTML editor.  I (am trying to) use it as a smart writing client front-end for a content management system.  In those terms, Mozilla provides an attractive alternative for developing a client.  Macromedia gives me a nice big API, but Mozilla gives me the source.<p>

It's a weird, very interesting world.  I talk to the Dreamweaver engineers at Macromedia, and they speak in terms of DW 'platform'... which it is.  So there is DW the HTML WYSIWYG editor, and Dremweaver the platform.<p>

And there's Mozilla the browser, and Mozilla the platform.<p>

So I think there are very different expectations at work here.</i></font>
