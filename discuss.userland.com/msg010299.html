Still not as bad as letting anyone who knows your email address browse through every mail you've sent or received, using just one line of HTML. Normally an attacker has to be somewhere on the network between sender and receiver. But yeah, if you really want to be secure, strong encryption is the only way. Either PGP, or Hushmail if you want a web-based account.
