These basically script the installation of the OS so that it's easy for the novice to reinstall the OS on their specific set of hardware.  Most times you simply don't see all the dialog boxes that you'd get with a generic CD-ROM of the same OS.<p>

The problem comes when the big-name vendor does a crappy job of predetermining the hardware and appropriate software settings for their specific system model.  This is called quality control, right?<p>

Strangely (and sadly), if you had a standard off-the-shelf Windows NT 4.0 Workstation CD-ROM, it would probably be easier to talk you through the installation over the phone than dealing with one of these "we the all-knowing vendor have already decided how it will work" situations.  The key word there is "standard."<p>

Advice:  Find a locally-owned shop that will build and integrate everything for you.  They should at least ask you how you want it before they start, which is more than you get with the big-names.  Plus there's a place you can take it if there's a problem, and a human being you can look at and develop a professional relationship with.  No cordless phone batteries required.
