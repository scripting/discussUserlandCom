"I've been playing with Frontier and COM. As I understand it, Frontier is currently only a COM server. If you could make it work as a client too (hint!), you could do what you wanted more elegantly (assuming IE's COM works the way it should)."<p>

Aye, there's the rub, it appears that IE's COM doesn't work the way it should. Or, at least, I can't get it to work.<p>

About Frontier as a COM client -- what do you think of the idea of running VBScript, JScript, and PerlScript scripts in Frontier? These languages are built for COM.
