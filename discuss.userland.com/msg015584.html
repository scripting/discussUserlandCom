<br>
"Key responsibilities of this position include: prioritizing new inventions and converting them into patent applications through direct interaction with scientists...."<p>

Letting lawyers prioritize R&D? If Web patents threaten to kill the Internet slowly by a thousand cuts, then letting lawyers into the development labs will surely take care of the matter efficiently with a single shot to the head. <p>

And if consumers think that engineer-centric design is suboptimal they should really enjoy lawyer-centric design. I am very hard pressed to think of how even an MBA could think this is a good idea. But then, that's probably because I don't have a lawyer glancing over my shoulder guiding my creative process yet. <p>

On the positive side, the satiric possibilities are almost endless :)
