"Writing server-side JavaScript (SSJS) applications has been one of the more
common tasks that we've performed within Netscape Germany's Worldwide
Professional Services group. After some experiences with hard-coded user
interfaces, we came across the View Source article Using Presentation Templates
With Server-Side JavaScript: A Simple Way to Change an Application's Look and
Feel Without Touching the Source Code. In that article, Glen Long describes a
simple template engine, written entirely in JavaScript, that replaces special
placeholder tags in HTML pages (of the form <%name%>) with a value that was
defined by the SSJS application at run time. This mechanism enables the
application logic to be separate from the presentation logic. To store the
name/value pairs, Glen simply used the attributes of a JavaScript object.<p>

Template engines are not a new invention, but writing one that's so simple in
JavaScript demonstrated JavaScript's power - and it made our lives a whole lot
easier. But as soon as we started to use Glen's template engine, we found
several shortcomings in the implementation. Since everything was written in
JavaScript, it was easy to change, so we enhanced it quite a bit, adding several
useful features that made it even more valuable to us and easier to use. The
result of our efforts is the JavaScript Template Engine (JSTE), which offers
several new types of tags with these capabilities: including templates within
templates; showing and hiding HTML based on conditions (with IF statements); and
extending JSTE via JavaScript plug-ins. Plug-ins for generating HTML <SELECT>
tags and iterating over an array of values are provided with the JSTE. We're
using the JSTE in several small administration applications in conjunction with
the JSLDAP library.
