Its and old argument that won't be resolved.  It can't be, since it is a purely emotional one based on distorted facts.  <p>

If you believe that making a free version of a proprietary program is sabotage, and that "field of endevor" includes the making and selling of proprietary software based on Free Software, then RMS and the GPL is evil.  <p>

If you see making a free version of a proprietary program as competition, and that "field of endevor" refers to the use(not distribution or creation) of Free Software, then the GPL is just another Open Source license(even though it is a restrictive one).
