I liked the comment I heard on the radio from a University of Utah professor. He said he was driving along, saw the tornado, and thought, "That looks like a tornado! But we don't get tornados here, so it must be something else."<p>

I now live in Moscow, Idaho (just at the start of the panhandle). We don't get tornados here, either, but there's a thunderstorm brewing outside. Hmm........
