This does disclose the fact that I do business with Wells Fargo, and I can definitely understand a guy being bothered by others chatting about where he keeps his money, but that issue is independent of this deep-linking thing.<p>

As for security, I wouldn't have set up to manage accounts by web if I didn't trust their security.  If someone is interested in manipulating my accounts, I recommend looking over my shoulder as I type my ATM PIN as the easier way to do it.<p>
