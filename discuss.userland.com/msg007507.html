I never want to waste effort. Never never. That's why we embraced RSS instantly. However, if RSS isn't going to move, or if it's only going to move to serve Netscape's interests, well we won't sign up for that, unless they have the market muscle to make it stick. In this case the market is two-sided, the content developers, and the people who read the stuff. They're strong in the latter, but they're not the only show in town, far from it. I listed all the other sites that I can think of off the top of my head that would feel that they had a say in the future of aggregation formats. For every one of those, there are fourteen wannabes like you and me. Making a standard emerge is a lot harder than Netscape apparently thinks it is. They're not walking into a vacuum here, others have been working on this stuff.
