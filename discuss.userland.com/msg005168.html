It's a little customizable yahoo style directory for keeping links and contacts.  Technically it is set up as a public site.  This is to make it easy for the people at our university to sign up.  However, please do NOT "sign up".  I have made a member entry for any Frontier users who may want to take a look.<p>

Feel free to add categories, links, and contacts to see how it all works.  But please do not change the password.  This membership record will be deleted after awhile.<p>

I will be making a public version later.  If anyone is interested in the gdb for this app please let me know.  If enough people are interested, I might clean it up and give it out.<p>

Any feedback is welcome,<p>
