At my company, I'm webmaster by default. No one else knows how to set up or administer the servers, so the task falls on me. Mind you I'm no expert. Setting up our Mac server and NT server wasn't too difficult, and I have a Unix background so I don't have too many problems messing with our Sun box.<p>

The point is I don't want to have to become an expert on each one. It would take me years to do that with each platform. But if there was some connection between each server that I could use, I wouldn't mind learning that. To me, all a benchmarks say is that I can qweak my stuff to beat your stuff. <p>

Part of my job is making recommendations for the back end piece of the sites we build for our clients. Unless the customer insists on a particular technology (which they usually don't), I try to stay away from solutions that only run an one platform. Why? Because I'm lazy. If Customer A comes to us and says "build us this wizzy-bang app for our ecommerce site, but it has to be build with ASP," and Customer B says "we want that wizzy-bang app you built for Customer A, but we want it for Solaris" I have to build the app twice. This is a waste of my time.<p>

What I want to be able to do is write wizzy-bang app in one program and deploy it where ever I want. <p>

BTW, none of this should be construed as an indictment against Microsoft or any one else. To some degree all companys try to lock you into their software.
