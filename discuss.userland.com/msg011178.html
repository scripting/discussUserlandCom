It's hard to have "evidence" when the discussion is about perception, but here's a story.<p>

I teach at a lot of conferences. At one of them, I was on a panel with myself, two guys, and a moderator (male).<p>

At one point, someone in the audience asked a question, and I knew that I had a great response. I flagged the moderator that I wanted to take the question. He gave it to someone else. I flagged him again to let him know that I wanted to add something when the other panelist was done. The moderator then called on the other guy.<p>

This happened several times during the talk. My assumption was that whatever I'd been doing to signal the moderator hadn't been working, that I'd been too subtle.<p>

On the shuttle bus from the hotel to the airport the next day, there were a couple of women that had attended the talk. They were *furious* about how it had gone. Their perception (they told me) was that I'd been *very* clear that I wanted to speak, and that the moderator had just ignored me and given the guys the bulk of the speaking time.<p>

Now, as to what was going on in the moderator's mind, I don't know; I don't read minds. He's someone I have immense respect for and someone who's given me some good help getting ahead in this business. But my perception was that I got less time to speak, and the perception of at least a couple of women in the audience was that I was clearly requesting chances to speak, but being turned down in favor of the guys.<p>

Evidence or not? I don't know--it's all about perception.
