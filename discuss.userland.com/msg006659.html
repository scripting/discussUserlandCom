second: i have several &#123;renderObject....}'s in a template.  the first object is an outline and doesn't have a renderer specified.  it renders as a list, as i want it to.  the second object, also an outline, has a renderer specified and renders as a table, as i want it to.  the third object, also an outline, doesn't have a renderer specified, but is rendered using the table renderer specified in the second object instead of the "default" renderer (whatever that is) the handles the first object.<p>

i've looked through user.html.renderers looking for the one that would just produce a bulleted list, but i can't seem to find it.  so i can't explicitly set the renderer for the first and third objects.<p>

why doesn't the renderer reset?<p>

help?<p>

ps.  i noticed that by putting the word default in quotes i've created a link to the default dg page.  is this a bug or a feature?<p>
