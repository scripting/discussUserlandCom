We could remember how you entered the Prefs system, but that link is going to be used by every xxx.userland.com site very soon. The Prefs system isn't even strictly a part of userland.com, we're already working with other sites on how to move information out of our prefs system into their CMSs.<p>

However, we do have the data storage ability to remember how you came into prefs.userland.com and give you a single-click way of going back there. <p>

Where would we put the link and what would we call it? We also want to try to make this stuff comprehensible to newbies.
