Does Christina Aguilera get any of my $30, or does it all go to the Led Zeppelin Trust or whoever owns "Kashmir"?</i><p>

That's the key. When you have all of these downloads, you know the relative popularity of <b>all</b> the music on your system.  It's no longer a statistical sample, it's a population survey.<p>

A week ago friday, the Wall Street Journal ran a story (dead trees version, in the second to last page of the weekend section, didn't see it online) from a jazz musician who occasionally gets ASCAP/BMI style royalty checks from airplay of a couple of albums that he did. <p>

From the US, he hardly gets anything, since the royalties are paid based on a statistical sampling of airplay, and the statistical sampling tends to undercount unpopular music. (you get a handle on how often unpopular music as a whole is played, you just don't get a good handle on what unpopular music is played in any given time period)<p>

From abroad, his royalty checks are 10x (the numbers I remember are $10 vs $150/month), since they count <b>every</b> time the song is played.<p>

Napster et al have the data on their servers to parcel the royalties out much more equitably than the current system manages.  <p>
