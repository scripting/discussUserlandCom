So its OK to kill someone with a mock trial because he killed several thousands. You cant fault the people who did this even though you agree it was a sham trial.<p>

Is it still OK if he killed one thousand?<br>
If he killed one hundred?<br>
Is it still OK if he killed ten?<br>
One?<p>

When is it not OK to do this kind of thing? When does it stop being OK to have a sham trial?<p>
