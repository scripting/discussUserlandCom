Sometimes I just want to listen to my music, which means CD's. <p>

Sometimes I want to listen to stuff from artists I like that might not be on CD [usually, live performances], so I want to fetch digital files.<p>

I really like the ability to listen to someone elses tunes. It's like going over to someone elses house, but over the internet, you can do it during work ;)<p>

Sometimes I want radio. I want to hear some new stufff, and some old stuff that I never bought. A streaming service, like (<a href="http://www.echo.com/index_invitation.jsp?ref=95820"
>echo</a>),  does this great. (Jazz and bluegrass in the morning)<p>

But I really want it all. I want an app that will handle all of the above (cd's,digital,sharing,custom streaming radio) with ease.<p>

I'd like levels of random play: A CD, digital music collection, mix of both, and mix with random tracks from a streaming service.<p>

If I put in a CD and I'm playing random music, I'd like the mix in some tracks from the cd. <p>

Then I'd like personal radio, which would know my music prefernces, and would mix in the on disk collection with the streaming collection. <p>

And they really are in denil if the think that anyone knowledgable is not going to capture a digitial file, from a streaming file. The best that they can hope for is that if you do capture a stream, and some fingerprint will prevent it from being played on some digital player. But then all one has to do is to reencode it at a different rate, and I bet the finger print will be destroyed.
