But the Internet will definitely have problems on Jan 1. Remember Murphy! (As if I have to tell *you*.)<p>

This afternoon I felt the earth shake. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9908/17/calif.quake.01.ap/">I wasn't dreaming</a>. I put on my shoes and bolted outdoors. It's been a while. <i>I hate earthquakes!</i><p>

Yesterday I took <a href="http://discuss.outliners.com/msgReader$159">screen shots</a> of Frontier 6/Win, focusing on the built-in outliner. Since re-releasing the Mac outliners, there's been a stream of questions from people wanting to know if there are any similar outliners on Windows. Yes there are. We have one. <p>
