Bwa?  What in the blue blazes is this?<p>

<B>There are a lot of people developing Linux -> It doesn't work well?</B><p>

This has GOT to be a quote taken out of context, or even a misquote.  This isn't FUD.  This is <I>nonsense</I>.  It has <I>no meaning</I>.  I suppose<p>

<B>There are 3 billion dollars worth of people developing Windows -> It does work well.</B><p>

would be a microsoft contention.  What's the difference... the three billion dollars?  Microsoft's design philosophy?  The Microsoft Quality Magic that we are all so familiar with?<p>

What is true about this statement from Microsoft that can't be said about Microsoft itself?  Help me here....
