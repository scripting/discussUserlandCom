It's true that the Perkins article doesn't say he invented Java, but others have. I don't really *know* for a fact that he didn't invent Java, but there's so much ill-will around it, that I suspect that it is true that he had nothing to do with it.<p>

I do know that Java was in exile. I had actually been following it from afar, when it was part of the Wayne Rosing empire at Sun. I actually tried and failed to get in the loop at that time. (Early 90s.) But Rosing was more of a press phenom than a heads-down developer. <p>

I have seen Joy on TV recently say that he invented Java. He talks about Java in the first person. I find this irritating. Not much more to it than that. He should keep doing it, because every time I get annoyed I learn something about myself. <p>

Onward!
