<b>Too many editors.</b><p>

I left Wired because they were always second-guessing what I was writing. They did it in a nice way, they said "Dave, everyone needs an editor." I was puzzled by this. At 39 at the time, I had made it that far without any editors. I didn't think they were right. Need? No way.<p>

The reason I left is that I found myself writing stuff to make it sail thru the editing process unchanged. Instead of loving to write, I ended up hating it. To me writing is a freeing thing. I remember the exhiliation I felt sending out <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet">Bill Gates vs the Internet</a> and <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1994/10/29/platformischinesehousehold">Platform is Chinese Household</a>. I thought, each time, that a wall of bricks was going to come down on me. I learned that the opposite happens, when you show vulnerability in an good way, the goodness of other people kicks in. Even <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1994/10/27/replyfrombillgates">Bill Gates</a> just wanted to be heard, even him. I think we're all that way, trying to be heard, our true selves, not the jerk so many people think we are.<p>

<blockquote><i>I think Bill got caught flat-footed here. At the Agenda 95 conference in September, I was surprised to hear him say that Microsoft's upcoming online service, Marvel, is a bet-the-company venture for the company. Now I think he's right. Bill is scrambling, he understands the stakes, and is doing the only reasonable thing he can do. The stakes are huge for him at a personal level: is he the next Ken Olson? Will Marvel be the DEC Rainbow of online systems???</i></blockquote><p>

But instead of exhiliration, as the editors creeped into my writing, I would have huge *fear* when I read the final copy on the HotWired <a href="http://www.hotwired.com/davenet/archive/">website</a>. How did they change my writing this time? They would change the meaning of my words, sometimes flipping it around 180 degrees. There were times when I wanted to write a Letter to the Editor telling the author to get a fucking clue, and I was the author, at least according to the byline.<p>

So I quit. <p>

Now, when I post a message here, I keep wondering what idiot is going to "prove" me wrong or corrupt or stupid. I edit my pieces while I'm writing with this in mind. It has become overwhelming. Again, I want to quit.<p>

I think in both cases it's about control, a very un-weblike thing. At Wired they wanted to assure some kind of uniformity, they thought of it as "quality", but I didn't like it. I am not that uniform. The things I like best about myself are fairly unique to me. I have fun when I'm being myself, and I get very tired when I worry.<p>

Frankly, there's no reason you can't post your complaints or worries to *your* website instead of mine. The only reason to post them here is because this is where I write. I need to think about another structure that allows comments but assures they're not reckless or inane. The Mail Pages worked. Maybe all I need is an Approve button? It's a possibility.<p>
