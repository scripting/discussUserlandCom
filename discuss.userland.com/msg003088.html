Missing in Action? <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3132">The MSIE5 Beta</a>. What do developers do when their hard disk crashes? Help, anyone from Microsoft. Shinpaugh needs your browser, how else are we going to do XML-RPC on the workstation? <p>

<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/insites/dvorak/jd.htm">PC Mag's John Dvorak</a> just posted a piece describing Windows 2001, a vision that's remarkably similar to the one expressed in today's DaveNet piece. <i>I like my screen shot better!</i><p>

MacWEEK: <a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/1999/02/21/germany.html">New Browser Comes from Germany</a>. And check out the editor's note on that page. They're having fun at MacWEEK. <i>That warms my heart!</i><p>

Interactive Week: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0,4164,2212986,00.html">CNET repositions</a> as a vertical portal. <i>Smart!</i><p>

<a href="http://www.scripting.com/gifs/controlpanel4.gif">Control panel screen shot #4</a>. Lots of new stuff. It connects to our todolist server via XML-RPC of course. There's a link manager that's smart (it uses a server pref to remember which pane is frontmost). Since I'm a word guy I put a real dictionary on my control panel. Right now you're thinking this is just like my.yahoo.com, well, it is and it isn't. Our application still is content management. Once more we're learning that everything you need to run a great portal is also needed to run a great CMS.<p>

BTW, one thing that may not be obvious from that screen shot, the application the browser is talking to is running on my desktop machine, not the server. This is the <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/09/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe">Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server</a> vision, realized. Practical benefit? I can access stuff thru my control panel that is private, stuff I don't want to store on a server.<p>

USA Today: <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/007043.htm">IBM working on a system-on-a-chip</a>. "You could have enough memory to store voice-mail messages right on the cell phone." <i>Of course the phone should be a web server too.</i><p>

Builder.com: <a href="http://builder.com/Servers/MacTutorial/ss01.html">To Mac or not to Mac</a>. They say that Macs can't be used for Enterprise Content Management (Vignette, Texis, etc). I'd like to see them back that up, even though they do say UserLand is <i>working on it.</i> I would say Macs have a distinct advantage here. Why not compare the content management on News.com (a Vignette site) with content management at MacWEEK (a UserLand site). Compare users to users. How do writers at News.com feel about StoryServer? How do the MacWEEK people feel about Frontier? Builder.com could help clear things up instead of adding to the confusion.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3090">Do you use</a> a Mac server in a content management scenario?<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3092">Michael Benevento</a>, at Apple-Europe, manages "a site with 120 authors spread all over Europe maintaining around 60 websites simultaneously." <i>Enterprise Content Management.</i><p>

BTW, to people who send me mail asking when a Linux version of Frontier is coming, if you want a respectful answer, don't call the computers I use PeeCees. Only very immature people can dismiss hundreds of millions of users that way. <i>Or maybe very stupid people.</i><p>

And if you send me a personal comment on this I will remember your name forever! People can be so intrusive. Simple message: MYOB. This is between me and the idiots who think they can win without working with Mac and Windows people.
