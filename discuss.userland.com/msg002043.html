The software works, it does what you're asking for and a lot more. Distribution is a different question. I'm sure if Microsoft volunteered to put some kind of runtime on every WIndows hard disk, we could probably work something out. Look at how well AOL has done with that kind of deal.<p>

I'm serious about that, btw, that's not a joke. You're asking for features that need to be out there, we happen to have them all in one EXE.
