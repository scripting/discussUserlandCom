Word 6, 95, 97/98, and maybe more. You're dumped into a nest of modal dialog boxes to set up styles. This is because Windows' windowing model wouldn't support the Mac model in 5.1 and later, and they'd lose the cross-platform advantage. I always thought the non-modal stylesheet editing was really cool in Word 5.1. It comes really close to "do by example" because the way you format text is the same way you make a style sheet. MORE does something pretty similar with its stylesheet-like things, and it's also very well done.<p>
