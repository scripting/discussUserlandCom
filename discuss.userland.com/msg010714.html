Now I am making them dynamic and adding discussion groups.  I was using the xfile suite<p>

<a href="http://www.spinwardstars.com/frontier/suites/xfile.html">http://www.spinwardstars.com/frontier/suites/xfile.html</a><p>

to manage my PDFs, but it doesn't seem to work with the odb render method.<p>

As a temp. work around I want to simply store the PDFs in a folder on my MAC and link to them from pages being served by Frontier (running on the same MAC).  It sounds simple, but I don't know how to do it.  Can anyone provide a suggestion?<p>

Thanks,<p>
