With LinuxToday, they have set things up so that they get more hits on the individual summary page for each link.</i><p>

LinuxToday provides all their current headlines and summaries in <a href="http://lwn.net/backend/biglt.txt">http://lwn.net/backend/biglt.txt</a>. As you point out, though, all the links in biglt.txt send you to their server.<p>

Slashdot provides headlines, categories and a few other bits of information. No descriptions (unless you pay Andover.Net, apparently).<p>
