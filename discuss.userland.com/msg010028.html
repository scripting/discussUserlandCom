Ron Rivest has a really interesting scheme called <a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/publications.html">Micromint</a>, which makes electronic coins with a secure hash algorithm. No public-key encryption, so it's very fast. But it's secure enough that it's not worthwhile to cheat on a small scale. (Cheat on a large scale, you'll probably be caught.) There's no real anonymity, but we probably won't get that until the Digicash patents run out.<p>

At a minimum, I think we'll be using these sorts of schemes to pay for the actual costs of storage and delivery. At that level, there's little incentive to cheat.
