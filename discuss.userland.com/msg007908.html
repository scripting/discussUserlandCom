<I>Thanks all for the pointers to Postgresql. Now if it were just multithreaded... </i><p>

Yeah, that's the downside. :-(<p>

If you need concurrent queries <i>and</i> transaction support, you'll have to start spending money. This is moot on a single processor machine, but it matters on a multiprocessor machine.<p>

But if Oracle costs too much for your budget, look at Sybase, DB/2, Informix and the other usual suspects. All of these are available for Linux, and I could swear that at least one of them has very good pricing.<p>

My recommendation: start with PostgreSQL (or MySQL, under certain circumstances) and see what happens. If your traffic outgrows the free databases, call your vendor, get a license for the database of your choice, and drop it into your site. This way, you don't have to pay the database licensing fees until you start thinking about hits/second. Once you've got several hits/second, any database becomes relatively cheap. It's the big checks up front which hurt. :-)<p>

Cheers,<br>
