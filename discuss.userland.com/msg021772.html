Many people have tried to tell him that, but he invariably casts it as a personal criticism and refuses to hear it." <br><br>	Rick, to say I'm unprofessional is one of the most personal things you can say about me. It's not an accusation to make casually, or else it reflects on your professionalism, not mine. <br><br>	Further, to make the discussion about me is to miss the bigger, more important issue. A community is stranded, now what do you want to do about that? After we figure that out, I want  people who we know to be ethical look at the discussion, and form an opinion about professionalism, and who has it. <br><br>	If no such person is willing to take a deeper look, then nothing has been said, nor does it deserve a response.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rick+saenz">Google search</a> on Rick Saenz.<br><br>	David McCusker: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21783">Professionalism and Lemonade</a>.<br><br>	People who question my integrity might want to check out <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/08/22/readerProfiles">comments</a> by some more prominent DaveNet readers. <br><br>	<a href="http://tim.oreillynet.com/discuss/msgReader$112">Gratitude</a>.
