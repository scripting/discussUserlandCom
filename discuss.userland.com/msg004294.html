I just checked the spec and didn't see anything new.  I scanned back through a couple pages of topics but didn't see anything there either.<p>

I'm busy using XML-RPC to communicate between front-end Python and Perl stuff (CGI scripts, modules published through ZopeHTTPServer or Mason components) and back-end Python stuff (databases). The biggest problem I've encountered when converting existing code to use XML-RPC is identifying and converting cases where I use Python's None object.  I have to figure out how it's used in the caller and callee, then figure out a reasonable replacement.  The end result is usually that my code isn't as clear as it used to be and that I wind up adding the occasional extra bug to my code (as if I don't have enough bugs to squash already).<p>

I would *really* like to see a <nil></nil> or <nil/> data type added to XML-RPC.
