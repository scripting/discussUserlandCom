He did however take things a little out of context.<p>

I really don't think that anyone could describe SPAMing a CEO as holding back.  I do however, feel that you were quite restrained in your public complaints about the service.  Bryce chose to apply the "holding back" to the wrong thing.<p>

Here's my view:<p>

<ul>
<li>An ISP that withdraws service abruptly is a terrible ISP.
<li>An ISP that can't handle complaints is a terrible ISP.
<li>A customer who SPAMs the ISP's CEO is not a customer many ISPs will want to keep
<li>A CEO who cuts problems away instead of tackling them is not a CEO many companyes would want to keep.
</ul><p>

Dave, how would you react if a Manila user had a problem, was unable to get a fix and chose to SPAM your inbox with automated log reports until the problem was fixed?  What if this happened while you were in the middle of fixing problems with your ISP and rolling out a Pike beta?<p>
