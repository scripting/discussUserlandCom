I've posted some pages at:<p>

<a href="http://www.wc.cc.va.us/frontierIMS/">http://www.wc.cc.va.us/frontierIMS/</a><p>

That talk about the Educom/NLII IMS Project, comparable products, comparable product reviews and standards in the field of IMS.<p>

It's not quite what Jean-Charles Bagneris suggested on "Script Meridian" in his original message, but I think it could be done by a team of Frontier volunteers.  Anyone interested?<p>
