How much does a standard sybdication format mean to me?  As a consumer of this data, i'm concerned with, in this order:<p>

1) the number of sites supporting some sort of syndication format
rationale:<p>

syndication in any format is a huge win for everyone.  
the more sources, the more valuable the editorial content vs. boilerplate press release content.<p>

2) the richness of the format allowing a whole range of 
 useful renderings.<p>

there are a whole range of useful UI's for accessing syndicated content, providing a rich set of attributes allows for more renderings.<p>


3) the ability to extend attributes of the format to allow for 
  creative ways of syndicating content.<p>

like adding search interfaces, search result ratings, full content, plain text content, avantgo content, etc.<p>


4) a substantial number of sites supporting a particular format.<p>

i can support multiple formats, but i need enough sites supporting a 
particular format in order to put the effort into supporting it.<p>

Comments?<p>
