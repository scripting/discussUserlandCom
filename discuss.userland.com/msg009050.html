I have a very simple cgi/Macro that puts an 'Edit this Page' button on  static pages. Security has to be handled by your webserver. Also I am sure there will be some utility to allow you to hide or show parts of your web page ( i.e the edit button) according to IP address. On the Mac I use Net cloak.<p>

I know this does not fit in exactly with the strategy you have described but it is extremely easy to impliment and allows users to edit pages with just a browser.<p>
