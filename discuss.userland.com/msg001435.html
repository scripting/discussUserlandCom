If Clinton truly is guilty of sexual harrassment, then he oughta go.  If he truly is guilty of perjury, then he oughta go as well.<p>

I haven't seen anything to convince me of either.  Furthermore, the way in which the investigation and impeachment has been handled leads me to believe that there isn't any evidence. Prosecutors with iron clad cases don't need to take their story to the talk show circuit. The chair of the justice committee wouldn't need to explain his case on Larry King if it was a strong case. The majority party wouldn't need to limit motions of censure if most people were convinced by the evidence.  These guys are afraid to let too much light shine on what is a shaky proposition at best.<p>

The basic rule of law is "innocent until proven guilty".  The defendent has the benefit that the burden of proof rests on the accusor.  Not only is this the law, it's the only decent and civilized way to proceeed.   Giving someone "the benefit of the doubt" is a core part my value system.  <p>

To me, this looks like a kindler, gentler lynching.  That's all.<p>

Alec.
