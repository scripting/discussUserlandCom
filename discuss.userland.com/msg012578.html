If most other Epinions members don't agree with your choices, why should you care?  They're not the ones who are going to be spending your money on computer equipment, books, movies, and so on.</p>
<p>Some people may want to see the "most popular reviwers" list because they want to follow the herd -- or at least, they follow the herd for a few yards before striking out on their own path.  Others might be curious about who's ahead in the horse race.  Others might be reviewers themselves, hoping for the ego-boost of getting voted to the top of the heap.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you don't fall into any of these categories, I think you can just ignore the list.</p>
