It's obvious to you and me, but probably gets lost for the novice, in the technical details of how it works.<p>

Also: I consider www.scripting.com to be "the home page" so I was confused initially by the language "your links will appear on the home page the next time it is refreshed". I hadnt noticed that I was going from www.scripting.com to my.userland.com (even though it is marked clearly on the page) so I expected *MY* links to show up on scripting news..
