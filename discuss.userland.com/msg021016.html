<i>The music industry favors streaming, not downloading. This presumably allows them to retain control of the music, in some way that's not too clear to me.</i><p>

This is a key point: <i>streaming does not confer the control they want</i>, because at some point the data has to leave the protected stream. How hard would it be to create a virtual sound card driver that, instead of talking to speakers, saved the data to disk? Or a widget that captured digital audio intended for USB speakers? Heck, even running a cable from the line_out to line_in on the sound card - there would be some loss, but sound cards are pretty good these days, and there's lots of spare horsepower. <p>

No, they're just going to have to cope, as the software industry did. Will there be piracy? Of course. Will the majority of people with a conscience pay anyway? I believe so. Will the losses be offset by lower costs of doing business (including fewer lawsuits) and revived interest in music? Again, I think so.
