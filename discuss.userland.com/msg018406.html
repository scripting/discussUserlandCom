I agree about open source. Gifts *are* cool. Exclusivity is boring. Doc Searls talks about inclusiveness, yet sings the praise of the open source gods, some of the most exclusive people I've ever met. I wonder how he would have us resolve that (apparent) contradiction?<br><br><b>From the It's Later Than You Think Department<a name="fromTheItsLaterThanYouThinkDepartment">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/09#fromTheItsLaterThanYouThinkDepartment" title="Permanent link to 'From the It's Later Than You Think Department' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I just got an email from a friend who suffered a massive heart attack, and survived.

It took me a few paragraphs to figure out that the author, Matt Richtel, examining a small corner of the music-on-the-Internet issue, was trivializing the user's perspective, through sarcasm. I doubt that the interviews are real. Shameful reporting, far below the Times' normal quality standards.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000709mag-wordimage.html">Max Frankel</a>, also writing in the Times, says "Americans will get the journalism they pay for." Interesting point. When writing about Internet issues, the Times will realize that the competition is fierce, and disrespect weakens Frankel's argument. The Richtel piece is <i>not</i> worth paying for, imho.<br><br>	<a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet">Making Money</a>: "The Web has its own mechanism for quality.

Got home at 3AM. Dot-com yuppies are talking about more interesting stuff now, not such a rush to get the options cashed out, more romance, flirting and singing. In other words the downturn for dot-coms is good for SF parties. <i>Another benefit!</i><br><br>	We also talked about relocating the Web industry from Potrero Hill to New Orleans. Such a beautiful city, I heard at the party that a lot of people have already moved there, to buy beautiful Garden District and Uptown homes, even mansions, for the price of a bungalow on Mariposa Street. <br><br>	But then I am reminded that there are two Louisianas, one that's uninhibited, with great music, food and architecture, and a big old river; and one that thumps the Bible and <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/po/20000708/co/20000708003.html">throws</a> people in jail for doing simple human things. <br><br>	(And it's a big <a href="http://www.aclu.org/library/case_against_death.html">death penalty</a> state.)<br><br>	At Davos, Shimon Peres gave another compelling argument for peace. Dot-com yuppies want parks, bike paths, good schools, no traffic jams, in other words, a high quality of life. Part of the quality of a life is the extent to which diversity is supported. To get on to the global economy growth path, you have to get your government out of places it doesn't belong.<br><br>	(Also, dot-com yuppies probably won't come if you're at war.)<br><br>	Prison must be the exception, not the rule. Sex is not the government's business.

Just as Sun's Java strategy always looked like an attack on Microsoft. One's coming from the desktop, the other's coming from the server, and both miss what the Net is about, which is inclusion. They talk inclusion, but on their terms. So the programmers will find ways to include both of them."<br><br>	<i>No parachutes!</i><br><br>	<a href="http://www.datacomm.ch/rf.buecheler/Moving/Moving.htm"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/movingEyes.gif" height="39" width="78" border="0"></a><br><br>
