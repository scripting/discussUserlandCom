People would just go somewhere else. How's that for a kick up the ass for the software industry? Let's face it, us guys have got away with far too much for far too long.<p>

Companies that enter into dialogue with their customers win. That's how it should be. In every other industry sector, that's how the winners are differentiated from the losers - service. Userland seem to understand this.<p>

Will other software companies take note? I doubt it, so I'll wish them a fond goodbye.
