As far as I know, netFrontier didn't make the transition to 5.0. Preston was on a long trip while we were shipping. Then something happened, not sure what, and he dropped out of the Frontier world. I think he still reads messages here, hopefully he'll chime up and help you out.<p>

However it seems if something were to happen with netFrontier from here, I imagine other people would have to take it over. Also <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tree$2.7.1">WebEdit</a> is a poor man's version that works across Macs and Windows machines, a necessity in the cross-platform world of 5.0 and above.<p>

<a href="http://www.erols.com/asg/tcpcmd/">TCPCMD</a> is alive and well. And Frontier has lots of built-in TCP support. There's been a lot of progress in Internetworking.<p>

Anyway, welcome back! Post your questions, this will be interesting, a transition from 4.2 to 6.0. You get a much better ODB browser and the outliner now has wrapping headlines.<p>

What kinds of things do you use Frontier for?
