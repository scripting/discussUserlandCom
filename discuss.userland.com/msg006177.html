Several messages in the Installing Linux thread have mentioned VNC (<a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/index.html">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/index.html</a>) as a way to view and control a screen from across a room or across the world. <p>

Clearly it doesn't run HTTP as the protocol, and clearly it requires a custom client to be installed, but if those hurdles were acceptable, couldn't it be adapted to let several people <b>view</b> (and only view) a screen, live, with latency close to the minimum achievable?<p>

It's cross-platform, quick to download, and free ($0), so it would seem a feasible candidate for inclusion.<p>

I see a potential win-win, but <caveat&gt; I've forgotten how strict or lax the constraints outlined in the beginning were, and if the requirements of VNC are wholly incompatible with your constraints, then this is just a silly message you can ignore.</caveat&gt;
