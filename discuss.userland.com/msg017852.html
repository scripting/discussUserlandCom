Bush tonight for $25K. I decided to pass. I'm saving my money for a dinner with musical artists.<br><br>	Then I listened to Sisters, by Annie Lenox and Aretha Franklin. The last line of the song: "Thank you, I'll get it myself." That summarizes what I have to say to the music industry.<br><br><b>Subterranean Homesick Blues<a name="subterraneanHomesickBlues">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/19#subterraneanHomesickBlues" title="Permanent link to 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Today's Scripting News is sung to the tune of <a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/subterranean.html">Subterranean Homesick Blues</a> by Bob Dylan. <br><br>	It's <a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/audio/albumtracks/RealAudio/subterranean_bringing.ram">available</a> in Real Audio on Bob Dylan's site.

Then I realized something. I had paid for all of it. I haven't downloaded anything that I didn't purchase at one time or another. <br><br>	I'm listening to Bob Dylan now, a song I remember listening to in the basement of my parents' house when I was 15. Hey I love this shit. Did I buy the record? You bet I did.<br><br>	I hate the record companies. What a bunch of jerks. Most of the music I have on CD I bought twice. Once on vinyl. Once on CD.

He's so cool. There are lots of people who don't like being written about, even in glowing terms. Alex is a Web guy, he has nothing to hide.<br><br>	Apparently his Fanco vision has been bought into by his new employers, <a href="http://www.pop.com/">Pop.Com</a>, a partnership of Dreamworks and Imagine, funded by Paul Allen. They bought <a href="http://www.countingdown.com/">countingdown.com</a>, a phenomenal site built around a model quite similar to the one described by Courtney Love. <br><br>	Alex read the Love speech and was excited. This is what I like about Alex, he gets excited over big ideas and doesn't look for reasons not to do them, as so many people in Silicon Valley do. I of course share the enthusiasm. <br><br>	Yesterday I asked Alex if his backers are the good guys, or are they the people who are being routed around by Napster? They're the biggest names in Hollywood. Read their launch <a href="http://www.pop.com/POP_pressrelease.htm">press release</a>. Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Paul Allen.<br><br>	I think we're looking at the biggest hole yet in the Internet business.

(IBM shipped first, we used their implementation to guide ours.) <br><br>	We also have support for <struct>s and <array>s which are essential to our applications, and probably most others.<br><br>	We will provide a SOAP 1.1 validator Web app, as we <a href="http://validator.xmlrpc.com/">have</a> for XML-RPC, and encourage others to test against this app. <br><br><b>The bulliest of pulpits<a name="theBulliestOfPulpits">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/19#theBulliestOfPulpits" title="Permanent link to 'The bulliest of pulpits' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/06/biztech/articles/19gale.html">Critic sees flaws in Microsoft Strategy</a>.<br><br>	This piece reviews David Gelertner's vision of the future, where gravity brings data back to desktops, a trend that UserLand has bet heavy on. According to Gelertner, Microsoft has not, instead moving data to servers. <br><br>	A great quote. "They have the bulliest pulpit in the world," Mr. Gelernter said of Microsoft, "but what have they done with it?" <br><br>	Microsoft rebuts. Yes, the desktop is important, but it'll take a while before that unwinds. Microsoft makes products for the mass of users, now the leading edge is exploring new ways to use the power of desktops in conjunction with the network. Imho, that's as it should be.<br><br>	Give Microsoft credit. Leading the way is unusual for them. Hey, it's unusual for any gorilla. I saw why as we did the SOAP project with them. Microsoft, inside, is a whole industry, a few standards bodies, lots of differing opinions, most of whom are sure that they're right. People who think Microsoft is brutal in their interface to the rest of the industry might be shocked to see how they deal with each other.<br><br>	Out of all that came a spec that can be implemented, and the docs don't fill a bookshelf. It's not as simple as the spec that came out of our four-person collaboration on XML-RPC, and it's got some vagueness, that we're working out now, as we implement the spec. It'll all come out well. No lock-in, a competitive environment, I hope.<br><br><b>Will you be there?<a name="willYouBeThere">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/19#willYouBeThere" title="Permanent link to 'Will you be there?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	On Thursday I'll be at Microsoft covering the rollout of NGWS, which is getting a new name.<br><br>	Survey: <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/willYouBeAtNgwsRollout">Will you be there</a>?<br><br>	A week from tomorrow I will at the <a href="http://www.risingtidesummit.com/default.asp">Rising Tide Summit</a> in Tarrytown, NY.<br><br>	Survey: <a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/willYouBeAtRisingTide">Will you be there</a>?<br><br>
