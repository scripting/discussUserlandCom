amen to that...<p>

fwiw, I'm gonna buy one as soon as the price drops a little
(making it my first Mac).  I don't care a second if the Dvoraks
or Harrises of the world thinks that disqualifies me
as a "sane professional" (though I'd prefer if they looked at
my work rather than my equipment when making those judgements).<p>

on the other hand, my wife doesn't really like the looks
if the new iBook.  go figure.<p>

(btw, didn't Dave plug Alan Cooper's must-read <i>The Inmates
Are Running The Asylum</i> a while ago?  looks to me as if Apple
is successfully applying Alan's "goal directed design" approach
on a group of "personas" that for the moment doesn't happen to
include Dvorak...)
