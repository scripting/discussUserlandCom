Lots of people asked for it. It's absolutely the right thing to do. With this capability you'll be easily keep a local version of the DocServer database, in outline form, in synch with the one on our server.<p><p>One of the first steps along this path was taken yesterday. I converted the DocServer website to being a dynamic site, running live, behind Frontier, on nirvana.userland.com, our new server.<p><p>However, until we switch over, this is the copy of DocServer that will be maintained. It's a step in the right direction, and a bit of dislocation, because the DocServer site on www.scripting.com won't get in synch until we're serving entirely from nirvana.<p><p>Anyway, to make a long story short, the updated version of the docs for table.uniqueName is at:<p><p><a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/docserver.root/table/uniqueName">http://nirvana.userland.com/docserver.root/table/uniqueName</a><p><p>Dave
