But I got to work and wanted to do something more interesting, so I moved the weird stuff <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$522">here</a>. <br><br>Two new Manila sites on the air today. Tim O'Reilly has a <a href="http://weblogs.oreillynet.com/tim/">new weblog</a>, with two new Tim-authored articles; and <a href="http://www.worldlink.co.uk/">WorldLink</a>, the magazine of the World Economic Forum (the Davos people) is now running on our Exodus server. Welcome!<br><br>WorldLink is more than a weblog. The full text of the <a href="http://www.worldlink.co.uk/current">current issue</a> is on the web and all back issues are indexed in the search engine. There's a discussion group and email bulletins. As far as I know this is the first print pub to transition to the web through Manila.<br><br>One problem remains to be solved for WorldLink, since it's a UK publication, it won't do to have the times expressed in Pacific. This is forcing an overhaul (a good one) in Manila that will allow each site to specify its home timezone.<br><br>Baseball tonight. I'm going to the Giants-Yankees exhibition game at the new <a href="http://sfgate.com/pacbellpark/">ballpark</a> in SF with Marc Canter, Dave Jacobs, Jimmi Johnson. Pics tomorrow for sure.<br><br>CamWorld: <a href="http://www.camworld.com/journal/rants/99/01/26.html">Anatomy of a Weblog</a>.<br><br>Wired News: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/edpolicy.html"> Editorial Policy</a>.<br><br>Adrian Murdoch: <a href="http://www.worldlink.co.uk/stories/storyReader$33">It's not me it's the system</a>.<br><br><a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$615">popo.at and weblogs.com</a>.
