First off, I'm sorry for dragging this topic back again when it's been dormant for over 5 days...<p>

A quick question:<p>

<i>A "bot" that's monitoring changes here might catch an unedited message and broadcast it. </i><p>

How does the "Email - Recive direct responses to the message on this page via email" work?<p>

If I check the box, and someone posts a reply - I get an email. If that person then modifies the message does the email get resent? If so, then I'm sure that's fine, but if not then there's a problem there...<p>

Just a thought.<p>
