I totally agree, it's easy to serialize and deserialize the expansionState for array-based and object-graph based in-memory outline structures.<p>

I hope you agree that making it simple for a "dynamic application that's generating OPML output" to present outlines smartly is going to be important to the nodeType/worldoutline vision.<p>

IMHO it'd be important for the usability of a dynamic nodeType application to be present outlines with an intelligent initial expansion state.<p>

<I>This approach of course would add overhead to the file, a fair amount.</I><p>

outline elements with attributes for use in a serious nodeType application are going to be pretty fat to begin with -- in that case an "isExpanded" attribute won't add too much overhead.<p>

Hmm, to keep the overhead low you could make the name of the attribute really short, like "exp" or something. :-)<p>

<I>And luckily it can be addressed later, when we have more of an installed base and more experience with how people are using the format.</I><p>

... and how people aren't using the format.  Agreed, time will tell.<p>
