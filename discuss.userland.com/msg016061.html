For example, the server you're using right now is one big honking xml-rpc application with lots of documented public interfaces.<p>

I've asked Microsoft to support xml-rpc in their implementation of soap, and they've given it a qualified thumbs up. The qualification is that support for xml-rpc won't be in their first release, and I know from experience that priorities can shift. They've basically said they'll wait and see what happens.<p>

Sun, for example, could say yes to xml-rpc, and beat Microsoft to doing it. This would be the truly Internet type thing to do. Let the small developers lead the big behemoths. It always works out that way anyway, we just waste a ton of time debating it with the press, who likes the Boy Kills Boy story so much.
