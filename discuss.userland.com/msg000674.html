Maybe even moreso given the recent evidence that he was human!<p>

Jefferson captured and encapsulated a dramatically different way of thinking about citizens and governments - a way that is still being explored and developed.  While many thinkers contributed to this, Jefferson turned it into reality in the United States.  It would be hard to argue against the idea that the United States and democracy have been the most compelling forces of the millenium; Jefferson is a symbol of that.
