My opinion only, but you can't call it the web if it's not HTTP.<p>

WAP is a supposed standard that allows Internet servers to send information to wireless devices. But the standard is fractured, and the wireless device vendors are confused.<p>

The confusion can be abated. Optimize existing standards of the net, XML and HTTP and do it transparently to web developers. I should be able to put an HTTP server on port 80 and have the <i>same content</i> as easily browsed by MSIE 5 and a wireless cell-device.<p>

The first vendor that does it this way will grab the whole market instantly.<p>

In my humble opinion, of course.<p>

Meanwhile, watch out for AOL. All the standards-oriented web developers focus their attention on Microsoft. <p>

A disturbing thing. All the holiday TV ads now not only mention the web URL for sites, but also AOL keywords. Ooops. How much do you have to pay to get a keyword on AOL? They cost more than $35 a year, I'm sure. Many times more. Orders of magnitude more. <p>

Even worse, try going to Netscape.Com. You get a popup window that urges you to get onto AOL. Let that sink in. The pioneer of the Web is trying convert you to a closed system.<p>

Hey on Friday I met with Yusuf Mehdi, MSN's top marketing guy. I asked Yusuf a question about browsers. "Microsoft fought so hard for dominance in browsers. Now that you have it, why not do something interesting with it?"<p>

Oddly enough, because of the way they invested, Microsoft has more to gain from wild growth in the web, than in a proprietary interface. AOL doesn't really have a developer program. Neither does Microsoft (for web developers) but either of them could.<p>

Interesting times. A flip-flop in progress?
