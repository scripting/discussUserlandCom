That decision sounds like laziness combined with stupidity to me.  (Look at Macromedia's Shockwave - available as ActiveX control, plug-in, even Java applet - if you want to get a rough idea of potential comparative program size and performance.)<p>

One useful data point is a comparison of Windows Media Player with the Quicktime Player, running a quicktime video.  Use Wintop (the Msft Kernal powertoy) to compare the processor cycles consumed.  Quicktime is a pig.<p>

Another "fact" that should not be overlooked is that file associations on Windows are a mess, with installation programs "stealing" associations from one another without consulting the user, and that is an architectural problem created (and maintained?) by Microsoft.
