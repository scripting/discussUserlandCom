Dave, I'm so sorry if that you feel this way. Please don't count me out just because you don't like my position on RSS. A few weeks ago you were <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/15">showering me with compliments</a> -- why the sudden change? I love the work that you're doing with Radio UserLand, XML-RPC and Manila -- I think it's really cool and I'd love to work together on it with you. <p>

I don't have any negative feelings against you personally, and I apologize for my misunderstandings about your position on RSS. As you've mentioned, I'm young, and learning. I'm very sorry.<p>

I don't want to dominate the conversation, and I don't want to come and take over your DG. All I want to do is read it, I won't even reply to it if you don't want me to. I think there's a lot of interesting discussion going on here, and I'd like to follow it.<p>

This isn't a power struggle. I'm just a small kid, who wants to learn, and I'd love to learn from all the great information pouring out here. Since I'm at school most of the day, and not online, I can't read it over the Web, so email is a very convienent medium for me. Otherwise, I'd just read it through the Web interface, like anyone else.<p>

I'm very sorry for the misunderstandings that have happened before, and I'd like to put the past behind me. Why should me as a person taint my software? I hope that you can see that this is a useful service, despite who may have created it, and that you'll allow it to continue.<p>

But, if you won't, that's your choice, and I will respect that decision.<p>

Thanks,<p>

Aaron
