Have you tried <<a href="http://www.clicktv.com/">http://www.clicktv.com/</a>> for your TV listings?<p>

I found it adequate for my needs.  Mine are pretty light though.  Generally I find a half dozen shows I like for the season and only record those.  Mostly Sci-Fi by the way! :-)  I use clickTV to find out what times the shows are on and then don't check in again until there is a time change or new show coming up.<p>

Good luck. If you do find a raw TV listings database on the net, let us know eh?  Even a subscription service might not be to bad if it didn't cost and arm and a leg.  Heh.
