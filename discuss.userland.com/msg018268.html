Perhaps MS are doing this for their own internal development purposes. They've long said they like programming in Java. There are things they want to change before they write WindowsXYZ in Java. This is what C# is for.<p>

They can move their C/C++ corpus to C# reasonably easily. An important thing here is that the generated code fits in with COM. Looking beyond the immediate syntax and runtime of the language. The code tree could be compiled to bytescodes, or to native code. One signal thing for me is decorating the source tree with all these little <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?PP=/library/toc/csref/csref0-0-16.xml&tocPath=csref0-0-16&URL=/library/prelim/csref/vclrfcsharpspec_17.htm">attributes</a>.<p>

Look at some other movements - Charles Simonyis' pet - <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/ip/">Intentional Programming </a>- that group has <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/ip/NewsMove.htm">moved </a>into the Visual Tools group. 'The IP Project is moving from Research into Development, to gear up for larger scale internal use and eventual shipping.'<p>

Quite a few of the Functional Programming resarchers around are now at Microsoft Research, they are avid tree transformers, decorators, code-compilers. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/ ">Simon Peyton-Jones.</a> Look at his paper 'Aspect Oriented Compilers'. There's a tip of the hat to the IP group in there.<p>

Predications - the current Win32 API will dissapear into a COM like thing. Everything in the OS will become a COM like object. C# will be used for system level components in Visual Tools environments. Next Intensional Programming will be launched in the VisualStudio enviroment. You will edit higher levels abstractions 'Intensions' and these will be transformed to lower level code. Visio will be pulled in as a way to edit using diagrams - to draw software.<p>

Look at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/DirectX/dxm/help/ds/oview/Filter_Graph_Manager.htm">filter-graphs </a>in DirectShow. <p>

Anders Heijslberg on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/prelim/csref/vclrfcsharpspecstart.htm ">C#</a> (formerly architect of Delphi). What MS are doing with these people and Bill and Charles is constantly reappraising and developing the way they write component software. This may mean your software, but it definately means theirs.
