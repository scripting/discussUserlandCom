And there's the catch, since mathematical proofs are self-contained and deductive: classical geometry proceeds from Euclid's "self-evident truths", Newton's laws of motion from the <i>Principia</i>'s axioms. <p>

What seems to happen in disputes over the nebulous matter of Open Source is that people on all sides try to apply <b>deductive</b> principles to a subject that can only be treated <b>inductively</b>, where judgements proceed from the accumulation of discrete facts and opinions, that are tested in the manner of a legal case: proved beyond reasonable doubt, or decided on the preponderance of evidence.<p>

We'll only be able to treat Open Source like geometry when we agree on a set of Euclidian axioms. I don't see that happening too quickly. And that's probably a good thing.
