I really look forward for my cable connection so I can play with the server too!<p>

The cookie stuff worked just fine, here, with Netscape 4.0.4.<p>

Just too remarks, Dave:<p>

1. In the box where I was asked my email (the one where there's no password field) I first entered something like "@flip@mail.dotcom.fr". It didn't pass and I got the same page to try again. But when I entered "flip". It passed as a valid email, and I got the page saying me "check your email". <p>

2. It seems that the only way to write a new message is to respond to a previous one? <p>

Great stuff, anyway!<p>

Cheers,<p>
