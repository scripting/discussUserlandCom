We're encountering serious load handling problems on Mac OS, probably due to an antiquated library we're using to do TCP on the Mac. I say probably because we don't know. Andre has just done a new build internally that uses a new library that connects to more modern (OpenTransport) TCP capability. Will this make it better? We won't know until we test it.<p>

Frontier on the Mac is probably still more powerful than Frontier  for Windows, though, in quite a few ways. A more mature base of scriptable apps is probably the largest advantage, and it's nothing to sneeze at. We still don't have a way to script WinZip on Windows for example, and the comparable functionality for the Mac is quite mature and easy.<p>

But for straight Manila hosting and plug-in development, I would recommend NT or Windows 2000.
