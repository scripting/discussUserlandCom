  some servers.) Being able to discover the URI for the XML RPC
  services on a given HTTP host as well as discover the appropriate
  MIME type allows a diverse range of servers to use their own 
  calling conventions to support the same RPC service.<p>

If "text/xml" is too broad and you don't want to tie to a particular URI, I think you should add a parameter to the media type, e.g.:<p>

    Content-type: text/xml; service=XML-RPC<p>
