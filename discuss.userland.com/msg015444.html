First, there needs to be some difference between the begining and the end notation that signals that something needs to be linked -- other wise, how is the code supposed to know when to begin the link and end it?<p>

Example:<p>

This is some data that **needs** to be **linked**.<p>

We could link the words "needs" and "linked" because they are between the **'s -- but we should also link " to be " since they are ALSO between the **'s, right?<p>

So with that in mind, I have hacked out a simple function that you can pass in your string to be linked, a begining token and an end token. If this does not post correctly, email me and I will send it via email or whatever.  I hope this helps. <p>

** Please note, the bulk of this code is based on <a href="http://www.asp101.com">http://www.asp101.com</a> Url link sample code.<p>

I tried to paste in the code, but it looked horrid.  Please visit here:<p>

and download the server code by hitting the view code link.<p>

I hope this helps & I'd love to hear if anyone else has any better solutions since this is something that everyone could use in their reusable code libs...
