The article is a bit misleading. As I mention in another message, the article says that new regulations/guidelines will prohibit use of multiple languages. This is illogical, since the alleged prohibition would prevent a government website from having a link titled 'Se Habla Espanol', leading to a Spanish version of the site. Hardly an advance for accessibility!<p><p>

In reality, the guidelines ask that websites merely *identify* the languages used, in the markup language. That way, alternate browsing technologies can deal with the text or at least fail gracefully.<p><p>

The article in question has created a lot of debate on the Freedom Forum's online discussion forums, which would be worth a look.<p><p>
