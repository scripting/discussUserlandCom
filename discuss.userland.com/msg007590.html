This evening I've got it working and it's interesting!<p>

<a href="http://my.userland.com/newstories">http://my.userland.com/newstories</a><p>

<b>How it works</b><p>

As we load channels, when a new story appears it's added at the top of this page, along with a link to the channel it came from. <p>

If you watch this page as the day goes by, you get a "join" of all the news channels participating in My.UserLand.Com. <p>

An observation, channels that use the fat <scriptingNews> 2.0b1 format look a lot more reasonable viewed this way.<p>

And while I think it's important to say where the story came from, ie who's pointing to it, I think the rightmost column is too wide. I have to take a fresh look at this in the morning.
