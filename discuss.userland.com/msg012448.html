I can't believe all the ridiculous hand-wringing on this from people who have little or no stake in the outcome.<p>

You know guys, I started this DG with two ideas:<p>

1. We needed a DG in our CMS and starting one seemed to be a good way to get it debugged.<p>

2. I was tired of editing the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/mail/">Mail Pages</a> and thought that some of the quality would show up here.<p>

#1 is totally accomplished. This DG is no longer needed for that purpose. And #2, sadly, did not happen. If you want us to continue to operate this DG, stop and think before you post "bad news" here.
