It will not be a discussion site any longer. Instead, it will offer tech stories and legislation alerts to be syndicated by other web sites, including discussion sites."

"Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues." (I chose the live version from Europe 72.) Now I gotta tell the truth. I've been listening to Weather Report Suite consistently for the last few days. It's fantastic programming and writing music. I'll take recommendations for tomorrow. What Dead song is most  like Weather Report?<br><br><a href="http://partners.nytimes.com/2001/01/24/opinion/24WED2.html?Partner=UserLand&RefId=mya,EFnnunuF-4=">The NY Times slams</a> Clinton for his pardon of Marc Rich.<br><br>It doesn't take long to find the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/newAdSizeForNewsCom.gif">gotcha</a> in the redesign at News.Com. There's a big huge ad in the middle of almost every story. News.Com, like every other dotcom, is radically altering its formula, wanting to be one of the survivors. If this proves economic (that is if people continue to read the stories wrapped around the flashing TV-size ads) then you can truly see the cost of being an eyeball. Judge for yourself if the editorial that surrounds the ads is worth the distraction. <br><br>Rube Goldberg would love this. Moreover produces a <a href="http://www.moreover.com/cgi-local/page?feed=139&o=rss">channel</a> that contains News.Com syndicated headlines. I subscribe to that channel. It sends me a <a href="http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?r14581676">link</a> back to Moreover. I click on it and am sent to a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-4585441.html?tag=unkn">page</a> on News.Com. To read a story distributed by Reuters. <br><br><a href="http://www.wiredfool.com/2001/01/23">Eric Soroos</a>: "Two weeks ago monday, we lost 2/3rds of the staff. Last friday, the rest of us stopped getting paid. But something strange is happening. It's not dying that easily. We're fighting for it, since we don't know what else to do, and we're not going to let it go quitely into that good night. We have cool apps, we have customers that are happy, and we have bandwidth for a little while longer." <i>Integrity.</i><br><br><a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/macosx/differences.html">Late Night Software</a> is accumulating a list of differences in AppleScript on Mac OS X. <br><br><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20010120/wl/us_world_forum_1.html">Davos</a> starts tomorrow. I'm sad I'm not <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$174">there</a>, but my rabbi lost his job. Oy. I said to <a href="http://www.davosnewbies.com/">Lance</a> I have to start my own Davos. He agreed. Then I got giddy. It turned into My.Davos and then, of course, My.Davos On The Desktop. I'll return someday, with my camera and a continued vigilance about software <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/01/21/theUsBlues">patents</a>. I know so many people who are there this year. Please if you see Jay Walker tell him to donate his patents to the public domain. And give <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$122">Esther</a> a hug for me. (I wonder if Katherine Harris will be there?)<br><br>It had been a long time since I looked at the OFS <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/">Top 100</a>. It's still running! Amazing. 1390 users. Where did they come from? Sheez. Blows me away.<br><br>One of the cool things about UI on a long Web page is that you can put the docs in the user interface. Here's an <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/longPromptsOnBrowserUi.gif">example</a>. I can take the user through the security options one step at a time. Do you want to turn off remote access. Do you want to turn off POSTing. And do you want to require a password. The cool thing is that I can explain *why* you might want to do these things right inline. This is a different philosophy from GUIs which depended on never-effective Help systems to get you the information you need. <br><br><a href="http://www.slacker.com/lists/clueless.html">Clueless</a> may sound cruel, but the idea is to get people to learn how to extract themselves from mailing lists.<br><br><b>I'm doing an experiment here<a name="imDoingAnExperimentHere">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/24#imDoingAnExperimentHere" title="Permanent link to 'I'm doing an experiment here' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'I'm doing an experiment here' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://127.0.0.1/myuserland/addChannel.wsf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscriptingnews.userland.com%2Fxml%2FscriptingNews2.xml"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/addToMUOTD.gif" height="13" width="20" border="0"></a> <br><br>
