I should have tested it first. I think Daniel Berlinger got this right in the next response. The docs on <a href="http://developers.userland.com/topics/searching">mainResponder and Searching</a> may be helpful.<p>

I think the error is being generated by a script living at config.mainResponder.callbacks.addMessage.index. This script assumes that you want to index the page and throws an error message if your discussion group doesn't support indexing...<p>

If you don't want to index your discussion group you could remove the callback scripts at config.mainResponder.editMessage.index and addMessage.index.
