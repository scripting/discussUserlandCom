I'm continually amazed at the quantity of kick ass apps (tm) emerging from Userland. A few weeks ago, I was ready to post that given your previous record, I should be expecting something really wild in 3 or 4 months. Weeks, months, What's an order of magnitude among friends.<p>

Congratulations.<p>

(kick ass apps are the close cousin of neat hacks. I particularly like that the installer is ~400 bytes. Not 400k. Not 400meg. 400 bytes.  Not quite a killer app, but then, killer apps can only be determined after the fact.)
