Good piece. I haven't read every sentence carefully searching for hidden agendas and trap doors, I'm sure they're doing that on Slashdot and elsewhere. As a commercial developer, it's great to get air cover from Microsoft, the largest commercial developer. It's a well thought-out piece, and it's a sign of how far off track we've gone that commercial development needs to be explained. Thanks to Microsoft for having the courage to pursue this. As stated by Mundie, Microsoft has an <i>inclusive</i> philosophy. Open source, except for the GPL, is similarly inclusive. It would be encouraging to see a balancing statement from the thought leaders of the OSS world.<br><br>Hewlett-Packard has <a href="http://soap.bluestone.com/interop/EchoService/results/client/index.html">joined</a> the SOAP 1.1 interop process. <br><br><a href="http://www.suck.com/daily/2001/05/03/">Suck</a>: "We were willing to believe that Tchong had committed the honest mistake of not bothering to read the article."<br><br>What is <a href="http://we.createastandard.com/">We Create A Standard?</a><br><br><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/journal/Faculty/bios/rosen/thoenes.htm">Jay Rosen</a>: "One of the strange things about journalism is that people are willing to die doing it.

I had a great birthday on and off the Net. I got a great present from <a href="http://my.netscape.com/publish/formats/rss-spec-0.91.html">Dan Libby</a>. It's great to finally get Netscape's position on RSS on the record after almost two years. That should end the pointless and humiliating discussion about what RSS is. In case there's another outage at Netscape, I <a href="http://www.scripting.com/netscapeDocs/RSS%200_91%20Spec,%20revision%203.html">archived</a> the July 1999 spec on a UserLand server. I linked the Netscape spec into our RSS 0.91 <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss091">spec</a>.<br><br>Edd Dumbill has a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/287">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/288">reports</a> from Hong Kong.<br><br>Having an empty hard disk isn't such a bad thing. I had backups but in some cases they were four or five months old. Like the DaveNet reader list. The development project I was working on for the last two weeks wasn't backed up <i>anywhere.</i> Oy. Anyway, the drive is on its way to Canada now, to a hard drive repair service. I'll let you know how it goes. (Postscript: We found a way to reconstruct the DaveNet reader list. Yes!)<br><br>Now about email. If you sent me an email in the last few days and are waiting for a response, please send it again. I lost all my email too. Oy. (It seems I'll be saying that a lot for a while.)<br><br>I've been thinking about Zeldman's <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/glamorous/glamorous45.html">Shrieking Man</a> piece. It's a common thread. There <i>are</i> stalkers out there, not many, but enough to spoil a lot of the fun that can happen in collaborative work on the Net. It often takes just one stinker to spoil the fun. It helps when people like Zeldman write about it, so we know we're not alone in dealing with such cruelty. Another possible solution is to start a Frequent-Flamers mail list, and empower people like Zeldman to forward the abusive emails to this list so the selfishness is documented.<br><br>Now, onto love not fear. The best birthday present came from my Mom, who is 68, and totally kicking butt. She sent me a beautiful quilt she made herself, and a box of homemade oatmeal chocolate chip cookies just like the ones she used to send me at summer camp when I was a kid. I don't know if many other people would love those cookies like I do, but to me they're a reminder of being supported as a child by a mother who loved me. Nice.<br><br>
