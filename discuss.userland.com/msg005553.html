It is call Newton Personal Data Sharing and it runs on the Newton platform serving web pages from the Notepad, Calendar and Names application among other things. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://come.to/lightyear_media">http://come.to/lightyear_media</a> An interesting feature is that when the servers come online they report to a tracker <a href="http://130.126.50.66/tracker.cgi">http://130.126.50.66/tracker.cgi</a> so you can get a list of all servers currently up. I'm running a dedicated server at <a href="http://deverman-2.user.msu.edu/">http://deverman-2.user.msu.edu/</a> It is pretty busy today so if it doesn't respond it probably went down under the heavy load. Its a really neat piece of software. A technology demonstration that with a lot of work was turned into something really useful.
