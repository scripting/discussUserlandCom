if defined (adrparamtable^.postArgs) &#123; for i = 1 to sizeOf (adrparamtable^.postArgs) &#123; if typeof(adrparamtable^.postArgs [i]) != tabletype &#123; adrparamtable^.postArgs [i] = latinToMac.convert (adrparamtable^.postArgs [i])&#125;&#125;&#125;; </i><p>

While this does address one problem with the latinToMac conversion that happens as part of mainResponder.respond, it still doesn't handle the problem that I brought up some months ago.<p>

Namely that if the type of entry in the postArgs table is a list, such as you would get with multiple checkboxes or multi-selects, the latinToMac conversion coerces this entry to a string.<p>

This just has to be a <i>bad thing</i>, since it forces you to have to check for the existence of "&#123;" in your postArg entries to see if you should coerce the entry back to a list before your post processing script can correctly handle the data...
