So, what do I say my app supports if I don't certify? Is it really open source to say that?</i><p>

I consider it still open <em>source</em>; they never claimed the <em>name</em> was open. (You know how programmers are, always tricky.) So if you aren't compatible, you have to use a different name. Red Hat, AbiWord, and Apache all have similar restrictions.<p>

I think the problem is already here. Have you tried to get an easy-to-install package of an open source MP3 encoder? It's a total PITA, because Fraunhofer is chasing people down.
