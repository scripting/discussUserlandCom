Must be the very first thing in the file, before absolutely anything else (except the language declaration if you have one, which would be <%@ Language = VBScript %>)<p>

Technically, you shouldn't need any HTML at all in the file.  It just needs to be a ".asp" file, which is a problem for ".html" files, but you can add file extension mappings under the Home Directory tab -- the configuration button.<p>

Alternatively, but much more involvedly, IIS is completely scriptable via ADSI.  After much searching, this is about the best article on the subject (Microsoft's documentation on ADSI is <i>really</i> bad)<p>

It's worth your understanding ADSI, because you can use it to control and access all kinds of directories and object stores.  I use it to access and authenticate against LDAP directories for example.<p>
