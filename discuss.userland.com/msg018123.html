It facilitates *copying*, often unauthorized and illegal. Compare it to a service that gives you CD-RW drives and a way to fill those CD-RWs with all the music someone else has in their possession.<p>

Question: if I own a record (let's say it got badly scratched) and you own the same record, do I have the legal right to take your record and make a copy on a casette tape? If I don't own said record, do I still have the right to copy your record to a casette tape?<p>

Question: doesn't the RIAA have to prove that specific transfers over Napster's net are illegal, in order to support its claim that Napster facilitates piracy?
