It keys off the type of the object. It looks like an address. Perhaps you have it set up as a string? The <a href="http://developers.userland.com/config/domains">docs</a> on config.mainResponder.domains are clear, I think. The routing depends on the type of the object.<p>

BTW, about the difference between members.root and discuss.root, I'm planning on putting in a feature request shortly after the release of 6.0 that would allow a discussion root to be stored in a member storage area, or maybe just the HTML rendering of a discussion root. In other words, like Frontier always has been, there's a lot of flexibility in what can be stored where. It's only going to get worse! (And that flexibility is a good thing, usually the answer to the Can I Do It? question in Frontier is Yes. That's why.)<p>

Stay with the program, I think it all is understandable. It took me a couple of months to grok it..
