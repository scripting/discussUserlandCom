I've pulled into the ODB of my site a binary (AIFF).  Did a Preview on it and it came through fine in the browser.  Now I want to link to this binary from a page.  As far as I can see, no entry for the binary was added to the glossary.<p>

My question is, what is the most economical way to make a link in a page to that binary.  I can of course use getLink and getPath.  I was hoping for something like an imageRef like script I could call.<p>

Also, is there a reason why binaries aren't added to the glossary?  I could have used glossSub if it was.<p>

Thanks for any thoughts you may have.  If you need more info, just ask and I can add it to this message.<p>
