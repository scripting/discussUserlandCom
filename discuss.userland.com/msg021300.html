I'd recommend it to anyone who wonders how "humans" are different, or why we came to think as we do. It's also not surprising why the book was controversial -- lots of humans are troubled by the theory of evolution as well.<p>

Now I have it sitting on my mantel mostly because it has such a pretentious title, but I still find myself recalling bits of that book's theory almost daily.<p>

I'm first-born as well.
