I haven't had time to actually build it yet, but here's the idea...<p>

You have to use frames. You have a top-level frame and a display frame and a very small "data" frame. The top level frame gets an outline by doing a GET to an fcgi...uhmm, I mean mainresponder script object. The script returns the outline in JavaScript by dynamycally creating a JavaScript class that mirrors the structure of the outline, and the target of the GET is the data frame, the html is just an empty page.<p>

Now JavaScript in the top-level frame can display the outline in the display frame by writing html to it, pulling the info from the JavaScript class in the "data" frame. The collapse/expand images are in <a> tags with JavaScript urls that call a function that rewrites the display frame, toggling the state of that headline.<p>

to edit a headline, click on it and a JavaScript function is called that pops a little window with a textarea. When you're all done browsing/editing the outline, click a save button and the JavaScript class representation of the outline is sent back to frontier with a POST.<p>

It's clumsier than a java applet or dhtml, the screen will flash every time you collapse/expand something, but it'll work in 95% or more of current browser population.</a>
