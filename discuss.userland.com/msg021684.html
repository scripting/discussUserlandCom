<i>I don't know their motivation for trademarking these terms. Could have been as simple as they didn't want them hijacked and used for something else not representative of their original purpose.</i><p>

I will try to make a short answer to your questions. As certain people already know, I'm an employee of W3C as Conformance Manager (we're now 64) and we have 450 members (Userland is one of them). Presentations done :)<p>

The trademarks arise at W3C to avoid the possibility of private companies to use the names for business and finally make a pursuit against W3C... Silly in fact, you have to protect free things or free names against people not necessary nice.<p>

Another point is conformance and validity. But it will be soon a debate that Dave could share with you in Scripting News.<p>
