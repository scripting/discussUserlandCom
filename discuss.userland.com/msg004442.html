Thanks Steve. I've got the creative-guy jitters right now. A lot of thinking went into that site, a lot of thinking over a

Dave - this happens to me all the time. I'll be working on something and be concentrating on getting aspect A refined, I show it to my co-workers and they start going off on aspects C,D and E<p>

BTW - the rigid structure is nice and I actually like the URL's.
