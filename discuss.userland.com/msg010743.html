I think this is something that can really help all users.<p>

However, I have a question - What am I missing?  Everything I read about with XMLRPC works in a situation, inosfar and I understand - as a connected environment.  How do we create this value disconnected?  This is what I'm missing?  Does this leave us with both bloated and thin apps - under the same moniker?  What have we gained, then.  <p>

Does anybody have any links or reading I can do to figure this out?  <p>

Or am I assuming that Personal Web Server from Microsoft is going to deliver the masses from this question?
