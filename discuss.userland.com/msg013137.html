This was the 1995 timeframe when MS wasn't sure the Internet and web lifestyle were everything. It was actually a pretty good app, esp since AOL didn't have a GUI design tool for Rainman. (We were talking with AOL about licensing MacBird, but it was very difficult keeping them focused on the idea.)<p>

Oh MacBird. When I was working on surveys.userland.com, it struck me that I could do one of the MacBird demo cards, the Are You Naked? app. That was about two orders of magnitude more complex than the surveys code, which was mind-numbingly complex. Look at how much we've lost. MacBird looks like a masterpiece compared to using the web browser as a UI environment.<p>

Then watching the flailing of Red Hat, I couldn't help think that MacBird might be the cure to their ills. Does Linux want a HyperCard? Something to open it up to graphics people. Wes's comment on Hack The Planet about a strategy beyond throwing money at KDE and Gnome also sparked some thoughts.<p>

I wonder if now isn't the time to release the source for MacBird? The only way it would be worth doing is if there were a developer community that would form around it. The only thing that's comparable is Tcl's UI builder, but I don't think they have a wizzy design app.<p>

I'm just thinking out loud. ";->"<p>

BTW, a disturbing thing, last week I went to Netscape.Com and a popup window tried to sell me on using AOL's client.<p>

Talk about the web selling out! There's Netscape trying to convert me *away* from the web.<p>
