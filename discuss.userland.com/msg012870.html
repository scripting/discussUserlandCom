Thanks, Dave!<p>

<i>What hardware are you serving it on? Seems very fast.</i><p>

Netcraft: www.redmonk.net is running Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12 on Linux<p>

Actually <a href="http://www.redmonk.net">http://www.redmonk.net</a> is a static site hosted by <a href="http://www.llamacom.com">llamacom.com</a>. I do all the work in frontier and then ftp it to Llamacom. I rolled my own micro-cms, based on Userland datastructures (calendar + stories), because news.root was a bit too hairy to sync between my work machine behind a firewall and a dial-up account at home.<p>

Llamacom's been great. You get an admin site, any number of email aliases, a pop account, some .cgi access. All for $6.95/Mo. and the domain registration.<p>

<i>I think you should do an XML version, maybe if there are a hundred other "slow sites" we could do a special page that you'd check once a year. We could even connect it up to MailToTheFuture somehow. Just thinking out loud. Anyway.</i><p>

I'll hook it up. This site took me 3 hours in Frontier, including design time. I love Frontier.<p>

<i>Congratulations on a very interesting site Steve!</i><p>

Yippee!<p>
