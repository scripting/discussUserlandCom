again: b&n is not hurt, in the long run, by amazon's market cap being higher. it just means it missed an opportunity that amazon took advantage of -- that it could have grown faster. but people still want brick and mortar bookstores. people will continue to flock to b&n, at least if b&n continues to play to its brick mortar (b&m!) stregnths: the tables and chairs to lounge and read in, the cappucinos.<p>

<i>In the news business, it's built around highly paid, highly polished, groups of people and their lawyers, pollsters, lobbyists, etc. Ted Turner is a player in Washington and other capitals, trading off news coverage against favors other people can do for him. </i><p>

to quote hugh grant in "notting hill": <i>that was </i>spectacularly <i>unfair.</i> journalists are perhaps not as well-paid as you  might guess. an entry level tech person at most newspapers is paid more than most, if not any, of the editors. and, even at broadcast organizations, the tom brokaws, with their brand-name faces, are the extreme exceptions, not the rule. <p>

and it's perhaps a bit unfair to say that ted turner or other media barons are trading news coverage for favors, at least insofar as brick and mortar vs. online . would you say the dominant news media have *under*played the import of the internet to business? that they have not been a bit guilty of overplay, or excessive hype?<p>

<i>I agree that individuals writing on their own, serving their own masters, are not likely to be more objective, or be closer to the truth, whatever that might be, but at least there's hope that the diversity will be for real, not staged. </i><p>

agreed!  i just think we have to be careful not to underestimate either the newcomers or the old-guard. i think the old-guard deserve perhaps a bit more credit.
