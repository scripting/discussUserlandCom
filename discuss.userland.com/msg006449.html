Uhh .. perhaps you mean that VQF is part of *MPEG* 4., the new MPEG that is using the QuickTime file format.<p>

Remember that MP3 is MPEG *1*, layer 3, not MPEG 3.<p>

I agree with the VQF site -- MP3's sound like crap.  A friend was trying to tell me how great the were and sent me a 56kbps one.  Horrible!  I already had a CD with the same track ("Private Investigations" by Dire Straits) so I encoded it using QDesign Music 2 (in QuickTime 4) at only 40 kbps and it was clearly superior -- the guitar note actually had some attack and the snare drum was much more defined.
