But let me rephrase my answer, to clarify what I meant by "functionality": Peter's question, I think, was whether there was a Linux application which handled outline-based code manipulation in a similar fashion to Frontier. (Or perhaps I should say, the outline model used by Frontier, as inherited from MORE etc.)<p>

Emacs does this.<p>

Dave, your analogies on "functionality" are valid, but in this respect, I'm not sure whether Peter was looking for more than a "pocket calculator", as far as outlining is concerned.
