Why?<p>

I can choose how the discussion appears: nested/threaded/flat.<p>

I can change the direction of comments: oldest/newest first.<p>

Moderation. Important comments get moderated up. Inane wisecracks get moderated away.<p>

I can easily navigate thresholds to view just the important comments or get the whole scoop.<p>

I can get the whole flow of the discussion just by scrolling. I prefer this rather than the summary view given by discuss.userland.com, for example. If there are two replies to a posted item I'd like to just see them with the posted item, not have to click on each one to get each comment. Each click means 5-20 seconds of wait time (I've got 100BT on a T3), and I can't quickly go back and see what so-and-so said in a previous comment without more page-by-page navigation.<p>

I don't much like the numbers. Instead of saying <B>In response to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14067">14067</a></B> it would be clearer to newbies to say <B>In response to <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14067">this message</a></B>. It actually took me quite a while to figure out discuss.userland.com. What do all those numbers mean? I'd rather see <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14066">Previous Message</a> than <B>Prev:</B> <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14066">14066</a>. But I belabor the point.<p>

To summarize, I like to see a list of topics and then go into the full discussion, not a page for what each person said.
