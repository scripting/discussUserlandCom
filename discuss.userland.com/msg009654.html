"Python adopts the sensible idea that white space should matter. It makes code more readable, and by incorporating the notion into Python's semantic structure, the language's inventor, Guido van Rossum, imposed a kind of order on programming that only Dave Winer's UserTalk scripting language and development environment succeeded in doing on a large scale in the recent past."<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$9682">I got an email</a> from Meera Srinivas at InfoWorld.Com saying that their linking policy has changed. It's true, their <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStat.pl?/readerservices/permissions.htm#link2">linking policy page</a> has changed. For background, see this <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/08/12/infoworldAndDeepLinking">DaveNet piece</a> and the <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$9274">discussion</a> that grew around the deep linking issue. <i>This change at InfoWorld happened in one week.</i><p>

<a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/1999/0819/news-redeye.html">Red Herring's Tony Perkins</a> loves Sun. It's interesting how he buys into the White Boy Welfare <a href="http://www.herring.com/mag/issue24/bill.html">rap</a> that Bill Joy invented Java. In fact Joy had nothing to do with the invention of Java. The press loves him because they can't understand what he says. Go figure. As I understand it, <a href="http://java.sun.com/people/jag/">James Gosling</a> was the lead developer on Java. <a href="http://java.sun.com:8081/people/people.html">A small team</a> with a handful core developers and <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/01/26/webenergy">marketers</a>. This is probably why I'll never be a <a href="http://www.benchmark.com/news/articles/karl_jacob_pr.html">darling</a> of the VC crowd. I can't stand credit-takers. I guess Gosling doesn't care? Whatever. <i>Onward!</i>
