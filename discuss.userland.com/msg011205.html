Well, I'm 100% sure that what you describe happens
to everyone.  On the other hand, I'm 100% sure that
there are enough biased geeks out there to guarantee
that things like that can happen to you just because
you're female...<p>

...<p>

It doesn't have to be humans involved, though.<p>

Last year, Infoseek (which later turned into go.com)
decided that I was female.  Everytime I tried to use
their search engine, they bombarded me with ads for
"always ultra thin slender maxis with wings" and
"pampers baby dry for newborn -- aren't you happy
you're now a mom?" as soon as I came into GET / HTTP/1.1-
distance from their site.  Since they used JavaScripted
popup ads which kept crashing my browser, I found the
whole thing quite annoying.<p>

After some digging, I found that they were using
something called "ultramatch", which tracked how
you navigated their site, and matched that with
a reference group.  Turned out that my on-line
behaviour was typical for a first-time mother...<p>

And when I complained to Infoseek, their support
droid told me that "many (if not most) male visitors
actually loves having diaper ads crash their browser".<p>

I no longer use their services.<p>

...<p>

(But there's still one thing that worries me: I later found
out that the "ultramatch technology" were developed by the
company that develops all fancy neural net-based data mining
systems for CIA, NRA, and all the other secret US agencies.<p>

Or maybe that's a very good reason not to be worried ;-)
