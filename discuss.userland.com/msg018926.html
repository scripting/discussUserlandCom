Since I'm not in the States, I can't recommend specific models and prices, but it sounds like that 1) you're not a 'serious' photographer (neither am I), and 2) you're interested in online pictures only, not prints.<p>

Then you're probably going to be happy with a low-end camera with a resolution of 800x600 pixels or even only 640x480. The resolution determines the general price class, then other features like lens quality and optical zoom come into play. <p>

We were looking for a camera that could do prints, so 6 months ago we went for the Nikon 800 for $750. It does 1600x1200 pixels and optical zoom. I've seen it here in Germany for around $600 now, so in the States it might be close to $500. We're happy with it. It's easy to use and the quality is comparable to the Nikon 950 (which Dave and Susan have), but without some of the bells and whistles.
