I find so many things on the web that I want to be able to come back to or to easily send to friends, co-workers, etc. Implementing a better way to both creating and looking at bookmarks would be extremely helpful. <p>

Right now I have a fairly robust set of bookmark directories. Because of how the big two have implemented bookmakes as pointers in directories, these are organized hierarchically. However since I am interested in a number of related and semi-related topics (they may only become related when I read them) this system doesn't really work very well. <p>

I have tried a number of ways to get around this problem:<p>

1. At times I get around this problem by creating multiple copies of bookmarks and filing the copies in all the directories that seem to apply.
2. I have also tried non-hierarchical represnetational systems such as "The Brain".<p>

Perhaps a better solution though would be to be able to assign "categories" to each bookmark a la Outlook (and a number of other email/appointment apps). By using categories in addition to folders for describing a bookmarks contents, searching for bookmarks would be made for flexible. While it is true that categories are not the way that I most commonly find my email, this is because I have so many possibilities for searching. For instance, I can search by folders, senders, recepients, subject lines, importance, dates, etc. Compared to these search features, bookmarks feel like orphans. <p>

A great feature would be for documents metatags to automatically become categories when a page is bookmarked. (In order for this to work well, the browser would need to be able to understand the relationship between "my" categories and the categories of the page designers. This sounds like a great XML app.)
