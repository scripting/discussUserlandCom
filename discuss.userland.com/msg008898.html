While the lack of documentation has seriously limited my use of Frontier, the real problem for me is the unnecessary clutter of the product. It's not it should be point-and-click - you can't do that to products as flexible as Frontier. It's just that it is so _seemingly_ disorganized with so much old cruft in there and lack of guideposts that going beyond the docs is virtually impossible without an excessive investment in time and energy.<p>

5.0 is better and on the right direction, but you have a long way to go. I like this product too much to not use it more than I do. It's frustrating. *Exactly* the same argument is part of why I'm a happy Mac guy and not a Windows person. The Mac, for all of it's faults, is considerably less cluttered.<p>

So my suggestion: now that you have a good writer, hire a maid. :-)
