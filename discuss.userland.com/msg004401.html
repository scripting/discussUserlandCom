My parents' university had a BitNET connection (remember all those percent signs in addresses?) on a VAX machine, and dialup access for people at home.  About the only thing to do was play with MUDs (Multi-User Domains, or some derivative thereof) -- essentially, telnet sessions into a server, where you could participate in multi-player role-playing games.  Even then, though, they were mostly used for chatting; everyone would find "rooms" to hang out in (i.e., when you enter, go north twice, then west once, then down, then south twice) and just talk about stuff.<p>

I also remember when I first saw the Web -- I was fortunate enough to be at a school with in-room terminal access (albeit over serial lines running through the PBX system).  I was able to get running a beta version of Mosaic, and everything was all grey, with no formatting to speak of and not much content.  Within a month or two, the school let us know that they had a central web server running, and that all of our terminal accounts had potential public_html directories in which we could (*gasp*) serve our own content.  At that point, I knew that this would be something that would eventually change the world -- people could, with minimal expertise, serve content to the WORLD.<p>

Coooool.
