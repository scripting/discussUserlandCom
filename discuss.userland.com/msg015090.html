I needed a clean install on one of my frontier machines, and so picked up the latest Full Clean install from support.userland, but when I had set it up, and configured it to my liking, found a strange thing:<p>

All the icons on the folder listings were broken links.<p>

A quick check on the properties of these images showed that mainresponsder was looking for the resource.root in www folder. It's not there. I have other copies of this root, so it's not a problem for me, as I copied one from there, but it could be a pain for new users.<p>

Just to let you know.<p>
