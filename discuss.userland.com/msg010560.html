One thing caught my eye: with this system, you could type in "VW new Beetle" and be transferred directly to <a href="http://www3.vw.com/cars/newbeetle/">The New Beetle's home page</a> deep within VW's web site. Presumably writing <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/Sorry-doesn't-work">VW new Beetle</a> as a deep link will then also work. Currently this kind of keywording only works for selected search engines and sites such as Netscape's NetCenter inter alia.<p>

The reason this is interesting is because, if this keyword system becomes important (as important or more important than URLs, for example) then it gives site owners a way to control with very fine grain degrees what people will find and see.<p>

Comments?
