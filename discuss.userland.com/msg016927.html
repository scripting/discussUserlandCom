First, Anarchie is not creating new directories when it uploads files from Frontier.  It used to do this without a problem.<p>

Second, It also wants to create directories in the file path that already exist and then it throws up an error 550 and stops the upload.<p>

I updated the glue successfully before I installed 3.7. In fact I don't have problems when I upload to directories that have existed for a while, only when I try to create new ones.<p>

Had anyone else run into this?
