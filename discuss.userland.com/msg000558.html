[Macro error: Array index is out of range. The list "sitesLinks" doesn't have an item #19.]<p>

(and I was only searching in the "discussionGroup" site.)<p>

And searching on "members.root" returned:<p>

The following error was encountered: <p>

•No Object Data <p>

This means that: <p>

    The remote server closed the connection before sending any data<p>

it wasn't clear if I was still searching only on the "discussion Group" site or all of Userland's sites (the text on the searc page appeared to indicate that I was searching all of the sites).<p>

Cheers,
Christopher.
