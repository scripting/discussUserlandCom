From the syllabus, it would appear that Greenspun and his colleagues are providing a reasonably balanced combination of mathematics, computer science, engineering, and project-oriented experience.  He has a number of people on his faculty and advisory board whose experience and judgement I respect (for example, Tufte on the visual display of information, and Hellerstein on databases).  If Greenspun should overemphasize the benefits of (relatinal) database-backed web sites, or underemphasize the importance of graphically-oriented web pages, I trust most of the students will have acquired the tools to reach their own conclusions.
