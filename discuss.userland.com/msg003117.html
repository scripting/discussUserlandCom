1) If you're on a Mac doing dynamic pages, you'll want incoming args -- POST args, searchArgs, pathArgs -- to be converted from Latin to Mac character sets.<p>

Frontier has never done this automatically in the past, it was always up to the developer to call latinToMac.convert.<p>

There are times when you don't want this conversion to be automatic. You don't want this conversion to be done on POSTed XML-RPC requests, for instance. You don't want this conversion to be automatic for old responders, like the .fcgi or .wsf responders, or else existing code may break.<p>

The trick is to find the right place to do the conversions, so that mainResponder users won't have to think about it, Macs work the same way as PCs. My current thinking is that mainResponder.respond should do the conversion automatically for mainResponder sites. It should not be done at a lower level. (And it should be documented, of course.)<p>

2) When moving Frontier objects from a Mac to a Windows machine, or Windows to Mac machine, characters are not converted.<p>

This behavior is the same regardless of how the object is moved, whether it's XML-RPC or the file system.<p>

This can lead to scenarios like this: on my Mac, I edit an outline containing the character &Egrave;.<p>

When I move this outline to my Windows machine, the character is now &eacute;.<p>

In other words, the character is not converted, it's char (233) on both machines.<p>

The problem is -- how does Frontier know to convert? The moved object may contain data that shouldn't be converted. The character may <i>need</i> to be char (233) both places, and the fact that one's an &Egrave; and the other an &eacute; is not important.<p>

But clearly, if you're writing web pages in Frontier's outliner on your Mac, and you WebEdit that outline to your Frontier NT server, you'd want &Egrave; to be &Egrave;.
