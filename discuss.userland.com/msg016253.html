The default settings for Outlook Express cause it to send out every message both as plain text and as HTML. The email looks fine when received by an HTML capable mail client like OE or Netscape's. It looks horrible and is really annoying in an old-fashioned email client used by people who are used to plain text being what email is about. It also is pretty bad when fed to mail list software that has not been made to delete the non-plain-text portions gracefully.<p>

Take a look at any of the messages you sent to xml-dev list that bounced, if one is still in your sent messages folder, using right-click and Properties. You'll see right off if it indeed has one of the offending headers that the CIO of Oasis listed.<p>

Where he's off the wall is that there is no reason for mailing list software to bounce such messages. I'm on a mailing list on egroups where I routinely see at the end of a message:<p>

<code>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</code><p>

But he's CIO of a sales association, not someone managing a business that provides mail list service. Since he is providing a mail list service he is in need of a clue on the technology.<p>

And if he sent that message to people who are not sending HTML email or V-Card attachments to the list, he is in double need of a clue.
