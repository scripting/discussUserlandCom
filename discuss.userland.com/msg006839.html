I find it interesting that one of the things that wasn't mentioned about weblogs is that they may be even more common on Intranets. At many companies there's an internal weblog pointing to things that are of interest to the employees of that company. It's a lot less of an imposition to publish a list of "Interesting News" and let people check it when they have a spare minute than to bombard the "everyone" mailing list with the actual articles.<p>

This is how I got started doing <a href=http://www.best.com/~davep/davespicks/>Dave's Picks</a>. Most weeks I found about a half-dozen stories or articles on the web that appealed to me or the business I was working for, and were easy to overlook, given the huge amount of data "out there". Even though I'm now publishing it myself, I still get people I used to work with checking in on it periodically to see what's new. Of course my focus has changed over time, but that's interesting, too. After reading the Salon article, I went back to see just what sort of articles I used to link to, and what I've been linking to lately. It's sort of a history of my interests.<p>

The most challenging thing I've found with a weblog is that it's tough to search back without just dumping all the links onto a single page (which makes for pages that are slow to load). I'd like some way of categorizing things, but haven't figured out a good way to have two parallel sets of pages, one ordered chronologically (as I have today), and one ordered by topic, but with some indication of when I added the link. Hmm. Another scripting project to ponder.<p>
