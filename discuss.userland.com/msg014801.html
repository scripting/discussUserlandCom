I was new to Frontier, but linked the scripting and outline-ness of it. When I read about "Whirlwind" and the the Macromedia move to CMS I sent him links to both Zope and Frontier. It seemed like some good potential synergy then and I'm hoping for some good synergy now.<p>

I'll be attending Seybold in Boston. Can't wait to see your Keynote.<p>
