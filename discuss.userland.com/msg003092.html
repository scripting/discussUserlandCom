In the spring of 1997 I created an CMS for Apple Europe's ChannelNet (extranet). This CMS is based on Frontier, and I am pretty sure it qualifies as Enterprise Content Management:<p>

- 120 authors spread all over Europe are maintaining around 60 websites simultaneously.<p>

- the sites are business critical (they are the only official communications channel for resellers and distributors)<p>

- the whole CMS is hosted on a single powermac 8500/250 running Frontier, WebSTAR and Anarchie and still going strong.<p>

Thanks,
Michel Benevento
