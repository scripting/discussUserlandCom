A search engine like Google might also pick up these changes.  <p>

Why not just add /robots.txt with the contents:<p>

User-agent: *<br>
Disallow: /<p>

All robots are now disallowed from looking at anything on the site.  If someone uses a robot at that point then they are either explicitly going against your wishes, don't adhere to the Robots.txt standard, or both.  In any case, they have little excuse for having done so, and your wishes and policy are now clear.<p>
