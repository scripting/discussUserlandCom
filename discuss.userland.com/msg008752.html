On the whole, they seem to be extremely reluctant to do this, and I can only think of two reasons:<p>

They haven't sorted out the business model for themselves.  I'm not talking about the advertising business model that you mention - even the 'no-brainer' model that would help sell more of their products is not yet obvious.  Examples include providing technical product info for semiconductors, or providing price and availability information for bookstore searches, or providing news feeds to paid-up subscribers.<p>

They are worried that XML content in the public domain is as good as lost forever.  Guy Murphy of Dialog Corp told me that although Dialog's internal systems were being switched over to XML, they would never publish in XML externally since their data could be de-branded, and that this loss would not be a one-off affair - the data exposed to the public domain would become worthless.
