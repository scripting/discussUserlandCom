I've paid for the following shareware products and they're really good for maintaining and editing digital photographs...<p>

lview PRO <<a href="http://www.lview.com">http://www.lview.com</a>>        for editing images<p>

SuperJPG  <<a href="http://www.midnightblue.com">http://www.midnightblue.com</a>> for cataloging<p>

The SuperJPG has a really neat image indexing function where
you create "keys" for your images and then just drag the images to
the keys.<p>

For instance, I have three sons - Eric, Owen, and Graham - and
I make a key for each. Every time I download pics from my camera, I
drag pictures with Eric to his key, and so on. The images stay where
you downloaded them to.<p>

Later, when I want pics of Eric and Owen but not Graham, I can set
up a simple query (graphically) and all the images from all the
directories come up.....<p>

This is soooo powerful it's easy to miss.<p>

Hope this helps in the quest for excellent imaging software....<p>

Cheers, Ralph Hempel
