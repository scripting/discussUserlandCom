It's called DWfile and it lives in your JSExtensions folder. If you download Apple's Webobjects, it downloads this extension as well but it's standalone as well.<p>

Also I need to build tomorrow an extension that will allow Dreamweaver to periodically run another command (which might be to check a folder) every set interval (like say every 5 minutes or something).
