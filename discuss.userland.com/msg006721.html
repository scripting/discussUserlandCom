Open Transport has supported (through third-party configuration interfaces) multiple IPs on the same or multiple interfaces since 1.1, and Apple has a simple, single-link interface (a text file) for a while too.<p>

Many people don't need real IP separation unless they're dealing with really old Web browsers (Netscape 1.1 etc.) If you do want it, you might be able to put Frontier behind WebTen or WebSTAR and map various URLs on different IPs to point to locations in Frontier, or be able to add a Host: header before passing the request to Frontier (which would work as before). From what I've read recently on the lists, networking will be more stable without Frontier as a direct Web server on the Mac, anyway.<p>
