You know what you could do...<p>

There's a time to live on dns records.  Before you make the change, set the time to live down. I.e. if it's at 1 day, set it to 1 hour about a day and a half before you make your big change.<p>

When you make your change, (or at least when you're satisfied that your change is right) set the TTL back up to it's original 1 day or 1 week.<p>

That way, for the little time around when you make your move, the DNS records will update faster than usual. It's a little higher load, but it shouldn't be that bad since conaxion is handling your DNS.<p>

ps: I like the new link color prefs.  Makes it easy for me to be a usability expert and not annoy the hell out of anyone else.
