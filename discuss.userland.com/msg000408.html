That won't sell me. I think slashdot is a cesspool of ill will, and the software is *very* hard to use. Aside from that, remember folks, this is a product, not a service. You're helping me test a product that's for Frontier sysops. So I can't do one-off things here, and simplicity counts for a lot.<p>

Also, the window title does include the subject if you browse thru the new interface. A basic requirement, don't make any suggestions unless you've read all the messages here. There aren't so many at this time, so it's a very reasonable requirement. You're browsing with the old discussionGroup.root interface. If you browse thru the tickets.root interface you'll be using the most modern stuff.<p>
