Hang on, hang on. Let's take that argument further, and argue that because the technology is available, and the audience for colour films is generally greater than that for B&W, we should be "colorizing" <i>Kind Hearts and Coronets</i>. Um, no.<p>

If you're going to classify musicians and producers as artists, then you have to acknowledge that they're mindful towards their media: the time-frame of the three minute pop single and the 74 minute album; the dynamics of FM radio and the CD player. To say that "it's just a matter of convenience" for the listener is basically to class music as "works for hire", and you're back in the Courtney Love trap.
