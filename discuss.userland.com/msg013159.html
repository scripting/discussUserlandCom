There needs to be a way to "check off" the ones you've read and have them not appear again unless they change.<p>

The idea that occurred to me was that this is exactly what news readers support, once you "read" a message, it's marked as read and disappears.<p>

An NNTP gateway for RSS would take RSS files, break them into items and "post" ones that are new or changed from the last read of the RSS file.  The title of the RSS item or the first few words of the description would be used as the message title, with the body of the message being the whole description.  The name of the group would be the reversed domain name of the site, and a channel name if there are multiple channels.  I.e. com.scripting.www<p>

This could be written as a batch script that posts to a real NNTP server or the gateway could be an NNTP server itself.  There's a Perl module that implements a simple NNTP server (that serves messages from a mailbox) called <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/NNML/">NNML::Server</a> that could be used for reference.
