A good name will make sense now and in the future.</i>"<p>

But what will be the future of your product, who knows. You said that there is a playlist feature, but the playlist could be maybe reoriented as booklist, bookmarks managers, etc. People are imaginative and we never could imagine how they use a technology. That's the fun part.<p>

I don't know yet the product, so I can't presume about his future, and what all of us could presume will be surely wrong. A Killer Application is an App with success that was not suspected.<p>

Possible names for Ex-Pike:<p>

Mato-Grosso (the opposite of Manila on the Globe).
