I actually installed it myself with a little phone support from Bob Bierman (the video part was tricky) and now I have a Linux server running on <a href="http://206.204.24.10/">http://206.204.24.10/</a> otherwise known as <a href="http://linux1.userland.com/">http://linux1.userland.com/</a> (Brent, please update the DNS for this.) <p>

I am very excited! I still don't know how to use the damned thing. I wish it was more like Windows. OK. Now I'm over that. (Not really.) <p>

The next thing I'd like to do is figure out how to access the machine from my NT desktop so I don't have to go over to the other side of the room. I understand that X-Windows will allow me to do this? <p>

I have a lot of reading to do, but I feel like I'm over the conceptual hurdle. I actually did the install and I'm quite pleased with myself. <p>
