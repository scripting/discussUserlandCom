An integration how? I'm not sure I understand. I work on
Unix, and play on Macs, maybe you're referring to
integration of the Internet into the OS ala WindowsXX? I've
followed a lot of your writing, but obviously I've missed
something.<p>

I'd think that your thesis would apply whether the various
applications were integrated (however that might happen) or
not. After all, an ICQ tool may be designed to be a useful
tool which doesn't get in the user's way, and can be
designed to be extended (as in Apple events, HTTP, etc.)
regardless of what other applications a user wants to use.<p>

Is this a continuation of the thread you were pursuing
wherein you stated that Linux needed a single standard GUI?
Presumably so all apps are familiar in their basic
interface?<p>

I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the impact
of this acquisition.
