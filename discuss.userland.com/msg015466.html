That would be sweet. I'm gonna look at a few of the libraries that have been posted to xml-rpc.com.<p>

Lately we have been really digging into servlets at philly.com.  Soon our newspapers will be published using a java servlet as the front end.  <a href="http://inqtest.philly.com">inqtest.philly.com</a> is a test site.  It's running on a slow server if you take a look.  It's just proof-of-concept.  It's completely dynamic (although, through the magic of servlets, it's doesn't look that way at all).   <p>

The more interesting of thing about the newspaper site is the backend.  For reasons I really can't get into, it would be awesome if there was an XML-RPC API available for the newspaper. We may set up something like this after we go live.  I have been pushing for including it now, and using XML-RPC internally between the system's various components.  It's a great glue protocol.  It may not be the best in performance, but it appears to make things so much more reusable.  <p>

A line I keep repeating to my coworkers - <i>The URL is the command line</i>.  <p>

XML-RPC reminds me more and more of OLE for inter-app communication in Windows, or ODBC for databases.  It almost makes sense that Microsoft has a role here.  People look at MS as the 'evil empire'.  Maybe true.  People forget how open ODBC was and how enabling it was.  A whole industry was built on it.  XML-RPC is the same type of enabler.  Hopefully SOAP will be too.<p>

Anyway, I just wanted to share my enthusiasm for your recent developments, from a developer point of view.  I wish I could be at March25.
