That's correct, WINE is not an emulator. It's a library that can be dynamically linked with Windows apps running on Unix, or even better, baked into the app, providing the same performance the app would have if it were a "native" Unix app, in fact it is a native Unix app, just using a different API to control the file system, TCP, user interface, etc.
