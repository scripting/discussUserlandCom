Please forgive me if these features exists; I looked and looked and couldn't find them.<p>

1. First things first, Discuss needs a HELP link at the top.    Give me a Help link that takes me to at least a very simple newbie guide.  I'll bet the info exists, just take me there and please display it in a new daughter browser window.<p>

2. At the top of a message, along with Author, Posted, Topic, Msg#, (in response to), Prev/Next, and Reads; give me ...    Prev in Topic: same as Back & prev equal bullet at bottom and Next in Topic: same as Back & next equal bullet at bottom.  Why should I have to click back and then a new link just to reach the next message in this topic?<p>

Thanks,<p>
