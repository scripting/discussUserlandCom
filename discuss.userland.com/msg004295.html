<i>Interesting side-effect of the MSIE5 shipment. It's been hard to get thru to our California servers because our ISP is Conxion. 999 days out of a 1000 this is a good deal, our pipe is extra-wide because we share that pipe with Microsoft's US download site, which is also hosted by Conxion. But when a new version of MSIE is released our sites get slow.</i><p>

Whew!!!  Thanks for the info Dave.  That probably explains what I've been experiencing the last couple of days when connecting to Userland's sites.<p>

Generally all the pages seem to loading much slower.  <discuss.userland.com&gt; has been the worst.  So bad for me, that I often just get the first couple of lines of the page.  Down to the &quot;Discuss: Start a New Topic&quot; line.  The rest of the page is blank.  Upon viewing the source for the page I could see a partial table in the source of the page.  This is happening on other Userland pages also.<p>

Other sites around the web are just fine.<p>

Has anyone else noticed the behavior?  I'm sure it'll clear up in several more days.  Just more of a point of information really.<p>

I'm in Portland, OR in the USA.  I'm on a Mac using Communicator 4.5.<p>

I wonder if there is a timeout parameter I could tweak somewhere?  I'd like to do that instead of hitting the reload button several times.<p>

Toodle-loooooooooo..........<p>
