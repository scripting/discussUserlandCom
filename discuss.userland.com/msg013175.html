On top of that he knows all the pokemon.<p>

Instead of fighting it I got envolved with him (so that I actually understand what the kids are talking about) and I am using this to help teach him new concepts like counting by 10's, how different actions you take effect other things, teaching fair play, etc.<p>

Sometimes it is just the way you look at it.  Just like the internet, it is a lot easier to understand it then fight it.
