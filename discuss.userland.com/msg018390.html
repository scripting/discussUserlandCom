This weekend's project is to explore a new format called outlineDocument. It's basically an XMLization of <a href="http://www.outliners.com/">outlines</a>, which come up a lot in our work, and I felt it was time to have an exchange format that's based on XML.<br><br>	As often is the case, the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/xml/currentOutline.xml">first demo app</a> for the new XML format is Scripting News. This outlineDocument is statically generated every time I make a change to this page. You can read the XML file, run it through an aggregator, render it differently, or mail it to yourself or others, or whatever.<br><br>	If you build something that reads this file, send me a URL and I'll link to it. But be ready for change, this format is still evolving.<br><br>	You can ignore the <rules> sections in the outlines, or if you want you can process them. Rules are <a href="http://pikebeta.userland.com/rules">explained</a> on the Pike-Beta site. <br><br>	HTML is preserved by the format. Left angle brackets and double-quotes are entity-encoded. Is this the right way to go? Let me know what you think.<br><br>	I'm working on a spec for this format. When it's ready I'll point to it here.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.langreiter.com/space/scripting-news-bare-bones">Chris Langreiter</a>, REBOLier extrordinaire, has already got a way to <a href="http://www.langreiter.com/cgi-bin/fractalized-scripting-news.r">view</a> the new format, which he calls Bare Bones.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/syndication/271?&start=242">I posted a note</a> about this on the Syndication mail list last night, so far no comments.<br><br><b>Jerry on amateurs<a name="jerryOnAmateurs">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/08#jerryOnAmateurs" title="Permanent link to 'Jerry on amateurs' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I got a nice email from Jerry Michalski about the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/07#truckinTheNews">mini-piece</a> I wrote last night at deadline (10PM) about amateurs taking over from the pros on the Web.<br><br>	It reminded me of a NY Times story I read at SFO on Thurs (dead trees still have their uses) re About.Com's editorial meeting. They use a model similar to the one we use on UserLand.Com (I think we have a better name). Well, what impressed me is that fewer people showed up at About's meeting than showed up at <a href="http://march25.editthispage.com/">ManilaPalooza</a> in March.<br><br>	About has run through many millions of dollars to get their thing going. Well, everyone here works for free, and we haven't spent more than $10K on promotion, if that much. This leads me to believe that you don't have to buy users and editors, that there are enough amateurs with talent who love to write and learn from others, for its own sake.<br><br>	I said to Jerry "I couldn't believe how close Max Frankel came to figuring it out." The full blueprint is in the <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet">Making Money</a> piece. I think a lot of people could benefit from reading the whole thing top to bottom. I just did. <br><br>	OK, there's been a market correction, so you might not get the huge market cap. But perhaps Son-San was right, and this correction is just shaking out the low quality garbage, and we'll get back on track once quality becomes the buzzword in Silicon Valley, not stupid bullshit like P2P. <br><br>	(Which is really just an invite back to the pyramid schemes of the late 90s the VCs made so much money with, and raised all those $billion funds on the basis of.)<br><br><b>Another Hack-the-Planet question<a name="anotherHacktheplanetQuestion">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/08#anotherHacktheplanetQuestion" title="Permanent link to 'Another Hack-the-Planet question' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	For some reason I felt like asking these <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$1291">questions</a> over on Wes Felter's excellent site.<br><br>	I want to play MP3 files from a script on Windows.<br><br>	I also need to know when the file is finished playing so I can launch another one.<br><br>	I want to turn Pike into a playlist editor. I want branching and reorganization.<br><br>	Is Napster scriptable?<br><br>	Answer came from Brent. Microsoft has a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/wm_media/wmpsdk/mmp_sdk/default.htm">Windows Media Player SDK</a>. And they have a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/wm_media/wmpsdk/mmp_sdk/overview/ASX_Creating.htm">playlist format</a>, in XML! All right.
