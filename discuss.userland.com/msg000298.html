For the next few hours there will be no way to post a message to the discussion group.<p>

I'm merging the storage system for the discussion group with the storage system for stories, change notes, sample code bits, etc.<p>

You'll still be able to read messages on the board, but you won't be able to post new ones.<p>


There may be breakage, and it may take more than a few hours. Remember Murphy is our lord. <p>
