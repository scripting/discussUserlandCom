It wasn't recognizing 23 as a double. It should have. It does now. (Glad I looked, we got another validation, from soaplite, running under Apache.)<br><br>Glenn Fleishman: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/22/technology/22WIRE.html?pagewanted=all">The Web, Without Wires, Wherever</a>.

Here's the prototype application. At UserLand everyone keeps a project outline in Radio. The combination of all the outlines is also a document. But we don't have a way to move the pieces around, yet, without making them public. Can Groove help us? <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/radio-userland/message/7392">Scott Loftesness says</a> that the folders it manages are not readable by other apps. That's the key feature. <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/radio-userland/message/7394">If we can get</a> Groove to maintain a folder or set of folders that Radio can watch, then when a new or updated file arrives, we can fold it into any Radio data structure we want. This is the bridge we want between the two worlds. The win for Radio users is privacy, the win for Groove is more users.<br><br><i>Due to a configuration error on the Radio mail list, only members could read the posts linked to above.

I'm thinking about it this morning. Lots of prior <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1028">art</a>. Two <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/tcp/getMail">basic</a> <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/tcp/sendMail">verbs</a> that appear to work. An application that we want which Scott Loftesness calls My UserLand on the Blackberry. Posting to a blog via email is compelling. But is it a feature or a framework? I suspect it's a feature. What can a framework do for us? Not clear. Email is pretty simple on its own.<br><br><a href="http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader$1248?mode=day">Arnold Palmer</a> pulls his Cadillac into a gas station..<br><br>Boy the thought police are pounding me today. Give up being my editor. Also give up being powerless. As Scoop Nisker says, if you don't like the news go out and <a href="http://www.manilasites.com/">make</a> some of your own.<br><br>It's been a <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=privilege">privilege</a> to experience the flames in and around Eric Raymond's life for the last 18 hours or so. It's something to behold. He seems to like it. He says awful things about Microsoft's software. <a href="http://joshua.editthispage.com">Joshua Allen</a>, who works at MS, takes the bait, puts up a good defense, to no purpose. Don Hopkins, as usual, is funny and outrageous. Here's the silly thing. All software <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware">sucks</a>, not just Microsoft's. <br><br>On the other hand, Raymond did help XML-RPC, and for that I am very appreciative. I find much of what he stands for unacceptable but I can still accept his support as long as I don't have to get into the bathtub with him. This is the philosophy of the Internet, as I see it. It's not that XML-RPC is like Unix, everything that's good is like Unix. It's also like Windows and Macintosh. (COM and Apple Events.) There are lots of things about Microsoft that I don't like. (And don't get me started on Apple.) But we seem to agree on one thing, we want our software to work with other software, regardless of what platform it runs on. I'm not sure if Raymond gets this. XML-RPC is far more revolutionary than it might appear at first glance. <br><br>I've read all the comments on SlashDot, but found <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=01/02/20/2011225&threshold=0&commentsort=0&mode=thread&cid=181">this one</a> most interesting. <br><br>A straight question for Sun lovers. Let's say I send you a Python script as an email enclosure. Can you run it from the emailer? If so, stop throwing bricks at Microsoft and fix your software first. Then let us know how you did it. <br><br>
