He was being outrageous, cantankerous, and contrary as usual; he refuses to swoon over the design just because it was different, and questions whether it will have a market. Those are valid points raised in an entertaining fashion. <p>

At the same time, he was pushing everybody's PC button (as in political correctness) -- I find it funny and sad that so many people instantly assume he's being sincere, and react by stereotyping him in return.<p>

Bottom line, Dvorak did a great job in creating page impressions for ZD Net.<p>

P.S. (added 11:30 EST) How many so-called pundits predicted the iMac would ever amount to much? Jobs and Apple have re-earned my respect. I'm considering an affair with a tangerine iBook and AirPort; don't tell my magnesium cased, ultra-thin 3lb Toshiba Portege. My guess is it'll take three months for a wintel iBook ripoff to show up.
