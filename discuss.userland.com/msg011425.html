Of course, everyone's favorite football (NS) is claiming this and that instantly creates animosity.<p>

That said, there are a lot of companies in Northern VA particularly.  There are other reasons for claiming this though.  Every state college (4-year and 2-year) is connected via a high-speed ATM network, Blacksburg in Southwest VA is the home of the BEV (<a href="http://www.bev.net/">http://www.bev.net/</a>), the first "most wired town" in the US, and a number of colleges are heavily involved in Internet2 and advanced Internet research (particularly Virginia Tech).<p>

Mind you, I would think the Research Triangle in North Carolina, or NCSA headquarters (in Indiana, right?) had as much claim.<p>
