Do you really think so? That seems risky to me.. Regardless, going on adventures with Apple seems even riskier. <p>

I read all the accounts on MacInTouch about the Avid situation. Seems like they got double-stung, they were doing clones to work around Apple's limits, perhaps they complained too much so Jobs bought a competitor from Macromedia. They pulled the plug on the clones leaving Avid without a viable Mac platform to sell. <p>

From my point of view Apple wants to go it alone, so I say let them. Keep the pain to a minimum. I don't feel like groveling. Ask them about their web development solutions. I'll bet you $5 the name Frontier never comes out of their mouth. <p>

Microsoft isn't going to do this kind of transition with Windows. Lots of Linux servers out there. We're happy supporting Mac OS and Win32, but have no plans for the 18th time, to support any other Apple operating system. It's Apple's job to make their OS run Mac apps. I'm sure they'll do a good job, they have to if they want to mainstream it as you say they will.
