I'm going to open a page and start ranting about what's fucked up in software and see if I come across a question that no one is asking. He's right, the group of people this is going to deserve better than double-knits, and he says many of them won't know much about the Mets, and any wiseass could ask a question like that. (I don't think he knows how I feel about the Mets.) He wants something brilliant. Brockman is more than an editor, he's an agent, and he does it very gently with much flattery. I guess he's been dealing with fragile writer egos for a long time.<br><br>News.Com: <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-4276794.html?tag=st.ne.1002.tgif.ni">Napster updates software</a>.

I wrote the XML code, then started writing the HTML code and paused. <br><br>	My XML-generating code is so simple and precise, it practically writes itself. HTML is another story. Whenever I dive into HTML I know I'm going to spend a lot of time and get inadequate results and probably get yelled at by someone for breaking some rule or breaking Netscape.<br><br>	This has given me a nasty feeling for HTML, I don't like to inqure of it, I never get fun ideas that relate to HTML. It's a horrible box to program in. Maybe this is why so many Web developers are so grouchy.<br><br>	I have a bad attitude about HTML. Could it be otherwise? I doubt it. It doesn't treat me with respect (I know about lineto-moveto-drawstring) so the unconscious response is to dis it back.<br><br><b>Teasers<a name="teasers">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/12/26#teasers" title="Permanent link to 'Teasers' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Teasers' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	Just for fun, here's the <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/rss/html/">folder</a> of HTML files, and here's the <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/rss/">folder</a> of XML files.
