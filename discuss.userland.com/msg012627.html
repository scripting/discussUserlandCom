If anyone knows an easy way to pass queries to a different whois db, maybe the userland whois could be that ultimate whois tool I'm looking for.</i><p>

I'd like nothing better. Our server calls NSI's server, so we won't return anything they don't already know about. I could send an email to Esther Dyson at ICANN, she's a longtime friend, and we've emailed about this stuff before. I'd like to know the answer myself, as a frequent domain speculator.
