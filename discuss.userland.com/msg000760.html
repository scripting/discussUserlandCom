Even British history in its modern form dates from the colonisation of 1066. Add to that Columbus, Marco Polo, the Pilgrims, Captain Cook...<p>

We began this millenium in the Dark Ages. We come out of it with technologies beyond belief. And it's notable that most people's choices are children of the Renaissance. (Has anyone been mentioned from 1000-1400?)
