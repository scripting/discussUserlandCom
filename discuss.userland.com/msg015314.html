This is terribly backwards from the rest of the system of justice we have in our country.  Fixing this and requiring companies filing patent infringement suits to post a bond when filing suit (in case they lose their suits) would go a long way towards fixing the system.

(After that, we can get patents trimmed from 20 years -- they were extended by GATT -- to 3 or 5 years, and then we can implement punitive damages when companies can be demonstrated to have knowingly filed bogus patents...)</p></p>
