Add a #defaultMembershipGroup attribute to the top-level website table of the second DG. Set its value to the name of the  membership group associated with that DG. Now mainResponder.members.checkMembership should automatically set up pta^.adrMemberInfo for that DG, too.<p>

If it doesn't work, the first thing to check is whether your mainResponder.root is up to date.
