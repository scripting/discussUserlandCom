When those disappear, the annotations sort of get stranded.  A lot of them stay well beyond the time the target was around... yet in order to prevent people from removing annotations by making periodic changes to the page, it will still show them.<p>

Any news page is full of stranded comments; the subject is usually long gone.  I actually stopped browsing with Third Voice (the "community" forming around Third Voice is one of the most vicious, spiteful, and bad mannered groups I've <I>ever</I> had the misfortune to participate in... this from a Usenet veteran!), but I doubt things have changed.
