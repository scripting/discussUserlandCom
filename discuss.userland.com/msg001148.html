Take a look at the UltimateBB (<a href="http://www.ultimatebb.com">http://www.ultimatebb.com</a>) which I think has a (partial?) implementation of this feature.<p>

(Note: This is not an advertisement, I'm in no way connected with this product.)<p>

Actually, take a look at <a href="http://www.prime-web.com/Ultimate20/Ultimate.cgi">http://www.prime-web.com/Ultimate20/Ultimate.cgi</a> which is the support forum for the UltimateBB, so you can see it in action. This 'bulletin board' supports unlimited forums, number of topics/posts in each forum, number of replies to each thread, graphical indication of new messages posted since your last visit (both for individual forums and threads), email notification of replies, message editing, closing threads, moderators, and a variety of other features.<p>

It's one of the best (at an affordable price), but at the pace this Discussion Group has been gaining features...
