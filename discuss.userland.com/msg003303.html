MSIE has the same restriction, and apparently doesn't have the good news that Java offers, in our tests, the HTML pages have to come from the same server too, leading to some awkward and expensive teamwork limitations.<p>

I have interesting idea here. You could XML-RPC the applet onto the server. That way I'd be out of the loop. We could make it an enclosure for a DG message. They have URLs.
