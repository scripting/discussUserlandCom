Number 1 on my list would be a "pre-load" capability. Let me specify the most likely next page someone will choose, and preload it into cache while they're reading the current page. If you find an HREF labeled "Next" pre-load it automatically. This is a totally benign enhancement that could make a real difference to the user. <p>


I am afraid the following will happen:<p>

- we would like to have a feature like this because when we actually decide to want to read the following link, it takes too long to load the linked page, since a) the server cannot handle the load or b) the net is stuffed or both.<p>

- if we have a couple of links per page, the browser is supposed to load all of the linked pages, even though most of us don't follow all links - at least I don't.<p>

- net result would be, imho, more server load and net congestion for loading a lot of pages I don't even read. And there are people out there who pay per traffic...<p>

- eventually, I believe that less traffic gives us better performance and thus less needs to preload into cache. Indexing and the like to help people find faster what they need seems like the best approach - at least that is what we believe in our project... :)<p>


comments, as always, welcome!
just my two cents,<p>
