(And furthermore, a person might be able to get items that they can't also check in or out.)<p>

But there may be other types of privileges as well.<p>

For instance, Mary might have access to websiteA, and she can only check out wp-texts and outlines that are web pages, she can't check out scripts, #directives, and so on. See where I'm going? So my question is: what types of access restrictions in addition to paths would be useful?
