That's typically true, but I'm not sure I agree it would be a waste of time: it would make possible a "once and for all" cracker of whatever particular system "the industry" had decided was "the answer." One crack for everything from Time-Warner, Universal... etc. etc. etc. No doubt other approaches could be more subtle and just as effective for the particular situation at hand; I just wonder whether one of the more subtle methods would be as universally applicable or have the same kind of message attached... a strong message about the futility of bit-protection technology in an era when enormous computing power is dirt-cheap.
