Multiple widget sets are no good for developers, in this case. They do have to choose. But as yet there isn't enough market mass to make the choice a critical issue. It's kind of like the 'good old days' ;-) before there was a dominant desktop OS. Maybe, with a little luck, the choices don't have to become mutually exclusive, in which case choice will be a good thing.<p>

But I don't think that slight variations in GUI make much of a difference to users. It's user-controlled; you select the window manager you want to use. As long as you don't switch between GUIs, your experience will be consistent.
