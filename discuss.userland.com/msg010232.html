The first choice on the subsequent page is <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$304">New Website</a> and the resulting page is straight to the point.  No pre-amble, no explanations, just "Do this!"  For too long, that's been too hard to find.  Actually, I still think this is too many clicks away from the front door.<p>

My reasoning has long been that you've got to show the power of the tool right up front.  Don't know about you, but when I get docs with products, I either don't read them, or I look for the "do this" examples.  I might one day read the explanations and philosophy, but right now I want to get something done.  That's why I bought the product.<p>

I don't know how hard this is to do, but my next steps would be:<p>

<ul>
<LI>Next and Previous links on the Website tutorial
<LI>A similar tutorial for Main Responder (but I wouldn't title it that -- it's <b>Dynamic Websites</b>).  
<LI>Chunking the sections of the Website Tutorial (at least visually on that page).  You've got 22 pages referenced, which is too many for people to remember (the magic number is 7 +- 2 things that most people can keep in mind at any one time).  Chunk it into something like Basics, Glossary, Images, Organizing, Outlines, Publishing.
</UL><p>

You know, with all that spare time you have! ;-)<p>
