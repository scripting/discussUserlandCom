Yes, you could do this. You'd need to write an XML-RPC server for Linux. See the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC website</a> for a list of XML-RPC implementations. Choose one which you're comfortable with (and which runs on Unix), and write a "compile and run" command.<p>

I imagine you could do this by setting up a limited-access account and reading the standard output of GCC and your students' programs.<p>
