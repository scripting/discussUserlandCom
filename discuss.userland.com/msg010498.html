I didn't precisely because of the question of permission. It seemed too much like stealing material.<p>

The argument in favor of scrapers seems to be that there is no significant difference from deep-linking. <b>But there is!</b> A scraper steals text, namely the text of the headlines that it scrapes.<p>

My wife used to be a journalist. She had told me that it takes talent and creativity to do headlines properly. For newspaper editors headlines are a vehicle of self-expression.<p>

Headlines used to seem trivial to me, until I began to write them for my weblog, the Dome News. (Shameless plug: <a href="http://einstein.stcloudstate.edu/Dome/">http://einstein.stcloudstate.edu/Dome/</a>) It takes real thought to create a headline that is zingy and creates interest in a story and represents the content accurately as well. And it needs to be short, generally the shorter the better. This is far less trivial than I had thought.<p>

Headlines represent just a few words each, but repeated scraping adds up. Kilobytes of headlines represent kilobytes of authored text that the scraper is using without permission.<p>

Weblogs often quote a headline or pieces of content when pointing at a story on another site. I do that. Dave does that. I think that's fair use. What's not fair use, is going to a site and shoveling out masses of their content with a robot for your own use.<p>

Headlines are content.<p>
