I guess I did not make myself entirely clear.<p>

Dave answered the question by example with his link from scripting news... :-)<p>

Apparently you can&#180;t use the storyReader on every DG entry (only those you promote to stories), but you can use the msgReader on any story as well.<p>

Here is the difference:<p>

<a href="http://farsideofmymind.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$47">Austrian Celebration with storyReader</A>.<BR>
<a href="http://farsideofmymind.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$47">Same page with msgReader</A><p>

I simply was to dumb to figure it out...<p>

Thanks & cheers,<p>

Oliver.
