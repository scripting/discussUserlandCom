However this fact <i>in and of itself</i> does not invalidate the whole notion of IP.  It just means that laws that make sense when applied to movable property don't make sense when applied to IP, and therefore IP needs different laws.  But IP <i>already has</i> different laws.  (Likewise, the laws regulating real estate, money, labor, and corporate entities have to take into account how <i>these</i> forms of property differ from movable physical property.)  If "property", in general, is just a legal abstraction that should be arranged for the public benefit (I know this is heresy to some people), then there's nothing fundamentally immoral or silly about creating a legal abstraction called "intellectual property", if <i>that</i> is set up in a way that serves the public benefit.
