<a href="http://www.byte.com/nntp/joncon?comment_id=1701">Jon Udell</a>: "Last night, at the O'Reilly Open Source conference in Monterey, Ted
Nelson and his team demonstrated and shipped Xanadu, the fabled hypertext system that inspired the World Wide Web. It was a remarkable
and strange moment."<p>

<a href="http://www.udanax.com/">Xanadu Secrets Become Open-Source</a>. "In celebration of the success and vast human benefit of the Open Source movement, we are proud at last to be able to present to the world the technical ideas and methods on which we worked so hard for so long."<p>

I downloaded the "Green" release of Xanadu and put it into a <a href="http://linux2.userland.com/users/admin/static/misc/xanaduGreen/aug22rel/">folder on my server</a> so I can read it thru the web. <i>You can too!</i><p>

Lots of Ted Nelson and Doug Engelbart links in the <a href="http://news.userland.com/1998/01/24">archive</a> from 1/24/98.<p>

<i>Is Xanadu a software antique? I think so!</i><p>
