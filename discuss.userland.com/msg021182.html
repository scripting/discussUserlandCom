You're usually OK.<p>

But if you're uncertain (perhaps you're building a proprietary front end to an open source application, and you wrote all the COM hooks yourself), you may want to talk to the author.<p>

Given the legal vagueness of a "derivative work" (and the recent trend of arbitrary court rulings), it's better to play nicely with the author. If the author <i>feels</i> ripped off, you weren't playing nicely, and the author may respond in kind.<p>

None of this is specific to open source, really. It's just good manners.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
