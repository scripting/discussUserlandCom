Basically, once an RSS file is registered there's no easy way to delete it, as the system currently works.<p>

We're allowing people other than the author of the file to do registrations. I think this is important. If RSS catches on and there are other registration servers, we will want *users* of the site to be able to tell our server about a RSS file.<p>

However, we want to enable sysops like yourself to be able to move a file to a different directory or server. In the real world, this happens often enough that we want to have a general solution.<p>

What I'd like to say is that you should change the old file to "redirect" to the new file. Something like this:<p>

<pre>
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<redirect>http://www.fool.com/directory/file.xml</redirect>
</pre><p>

Then when we read the file we'd check for a redirect and update the services table, which in turn would update services.xml automatically. This uses *your* security to assure that we're pointing to the right place, gives you full control, and also allows users of the site to do the registration.<p>

I'm going to ask Tim Bray for his advice on this. It could be that there already is a convention for redirection in XML, if there is, that's what we'll use.<p>

Thanks for raising this issue.
