I don't want to be rude or anything, but I can't resist to the example of the "unification" problem mentioned in my previous post.
In <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1963">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1963</a>, Dave is suggesting that  Docserver is at nirvana.userland.com,
whereas in a recent post to the Userland-List,
Brent wrote <p>

"DocServer has very recently been moved to another machine. 
All you have to do is change the server pref. 
Jump to user.rootUpdates.servers.DocServer,
 and set server to docserver.userland.com."<p>

The moral: any time there are multiple communication channels and they are kept independent, there will be inconsistencies.
I'm sure Frontier has the power to resolve that issue.<p>
