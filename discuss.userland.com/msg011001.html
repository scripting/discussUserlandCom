It has some sample code thta uses the MSXML COM object. I've written some code that manually parses XML files but the main problem is getting time-outs when trying to pull the code in with CFHTTP.<p>

You can see a sample of the CF code at work at <a href="http://www.developernation.com/dn_rdf/viewRDF.html">http://www.developernation.com/dn_rdf/viewRDF.html</a>. I've also done a Shockwve implimentation at <a href="http://www.developernation.com/dn_rdf/rdf.html">http://www.developernation.com/dn_rdf/rdf.html</a>
