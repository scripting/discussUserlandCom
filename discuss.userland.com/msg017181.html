<p>(a Manila Wishlist)</p>
<p>Over the last couple of months I've been keeping a weblog called
<a href="http://joel.editthispage.com">Joel on Software</a>. I think my weblog
is a bit different than most peoples'; I don't spend much time pointing to other
sites (there are people who do that better than I do). Instead, I tend to write
full-length articles about topics that are important to me. So I only post a
couple of times a week, but each article takes around an hour of work.</p>
<p>With such long articles, I am too terrified to use the
through-the-web editing that EditThisPage is famous for when I edit&nbsp; my
stories. One wrong move and I've lost everything. For a while, I tried writing
the story in pieces, submitting changes frequently, but people tended to read it
even before I was done, which was strange. So I developed a system of writing
the document in Microsoft FrontPage, and then cutting and pasting the HTML that
FrontPage generates into EditThisPage. I still use the &quot;Edit This
Page&quot; button for making small changes or for putting one paragraph stories
on my home page.</p>
<p>On the whole, ETP has been a good way to maintain a web site. I
haven't been able to use Pike -- still waiting for the inside-a-firewall version
to get that working. But here are my biggest wishlist items, starting with the
most important.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I could really use some good way of tracking how many people
    read my stories and how they're finding my site. To try and get an idea,
    I've literally stayed up until 3 am to watch the Top 100 list flip over, so
    I can see how many page reads I've gotten in the last 24 hours, but that
    doesn't give me nearly enough detail about what articles are most popular,
    who the most important referrers are, and so on.... stuff I could use to
    improve my writing. And since the Top 100 page shows &quot;top 100 over <i>x</i>
    months&quot; instead of &quot;top 100 over 24 hours&quot;, you can't even
    tell which pages are considered important anymore. For weeks, the top100
    list implied that march25.editthispage.com, a site about a meeting <i>in the
    past </i>that <i>never took place</i>, was more popular than my site.
    Imagine!</li>
  <li>
    <p>I really, really, really need a better way to control the
    bulletins and subscriber list. This breaks down to several feature requests.
    First, I would like a way to have people sign up for bulletins without
    providing a password and challenge question (as far as I know, the challenge
    question isn't even used anywhere.) Just an edit box where they type their
    email to get bulletins. I'm pretty sure that I'd have a <b>lot</b> more
    subscribers if I had that. Next, people should be able to unsubscribe by
    replying to the bulletin and asking to be unsubscribed. That's almost a
    standard feature for mailing lists these days and it's pretty much expected.
    Unfortunately, even if I wanted to remove someone from my list, there's no
    way to do it, and that's a <b>big</b> problem. As it is, when I send a
    message out to my 200-odd subscribers, I always get four bounces from places
    like &quot;<a href="mailto:a@a.com&quot">a@a.com&quot</a>; which are obviously not real subscribers. And I'd
    like to be able to promise my subscribers that if they ever get sick of
    hearing from me, I'll personally take them off the list.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Another kind of small issue is that the bulletin feature <i>seems</i>
    to be synchronous... you don't get the HTTP result back until all 200 emails
    have gone out. This just doesn't scale. I'm afraid that if I have too many
    members, I'll get a timeout and only the top ones on the list will get the
    bulletin. (I may be totally wrong on this. Correct me if I am.) A better
    architecture might be for the send bulletin command to &quot;spawn a
    thread&quot; that sends the bulletins later.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it would be nice if the web-browser-based editing
    were a lot better. I know, Dave tends to blame this on Microsoft, saying
    that web browsers make lousy word processors. But there's a LOT that could
    be done to address this using JavaScript, at least for Internet Explorer. My
    biggest feature request is the ability to save your work to a temporary but
    safe, private place, frequently, so that I can really compose on the web
    instead of using FrontPage and then copying stuff. My second biggest request
    would be a &quot;find&quot; command in the editor (totally possible using
    JavaScript, even in Netscape, I think) because when I see a typo in a 10
    page article, it's hard to find again in the editor.</li>
</ol>
<p>I sort of thought I was going to write a &quot;review&quot; of
ETP, and I just wound up writing a &quot;gripe list&quot;. On the whole, it's a
great tool, and I don't want to sound too negative, so think of this as a wish
list, not a full review.</p>
