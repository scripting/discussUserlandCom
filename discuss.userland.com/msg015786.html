One of the things I might do is write a column for some big web pub. The offers come from time to time. I think people listened better when I had the Wired name behind the Winer name. <p>

I also have a better idea of who I am as a writer, now, than I did when I was writing for Wired. I wanted not to be edited because I needed room to develop as a writer. <p>

Now the challenge may be to find an editor who can work with me, as Brent, Andre, Bob, and now Jake work with me on software. I think we can do a lot more than we do, if we add some serious editorial talent to the team. Or if I add myself to someone else's editorial team, in a way. Or do both! <p>

You'll see tomorrow that we're going in yet another new direction. I have an idea that the Web Apps conference could become a Seybold-level conference in a couple of years. This activity needs an editorial voice. So doing something bigger is what I have in mind.<p>

Like I said, shift happens.
