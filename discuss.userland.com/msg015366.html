If you are using a recent version of my mailserver, there is a hook there to send incoming email out as an xml-rpc message. <p>

If you have a sufficiently intelligent mail client or server, you should also be able to send any email message that you have as an xml-rpc request to a discussion group somewhere. <p>

There are also ways that an xml-rpc client can be hooked into a  rpc enabled mailserver to send the mail via xml-rpc for the first hop, then via smtp to the final destination. <p>

I've done at least a proof of concept of all of these. <p>
