- <b>What platform is this file for..........?</b> (this parameter would say whether the file was intended for PDA, Web, CD ROM or Broadband - perhaps there could be more - like pre-4.0 browsers versus post-4.0 - Netscape versus IE)<p>


- <b>Media embedded</b> - this is a major, major improvement.  Right now these file formats let in a single graphic - but needless to say should also include a video snippet, an audio snippet and perhaps an animation (either vector or bitmap based)<p>

- <b>And of course we want all those other extensions</b> - like actually something else besides just the links....... :-)<p>
