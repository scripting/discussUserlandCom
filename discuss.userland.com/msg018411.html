No one gets to be the gatekeeper, any more than anyone is the gatekeeper of the Web. Once you get gatekeepers it can't grow or route around outages. That's why the Yahoo and DMOZ directories are designed wrong and are dead-ends. They give too much power to a small number of people. <p>

(And the editors are anonymous. You don't even know the name of the editor for a category.)<p>

The Web's directory will become a distributed application, with editors vying for your attention, just as Weblogs do.
