Not being a Frontier Guru by any means I could use some help in automating the data source that Generator needs to read. <p>

Generator unfortunatly can't understand xml data sources and while it can read data from a URL, it needs to be a comma delimited text file. I think what I'm looking for is a file similar to the scriptingnews2.xml output, but to start with just containing the most recent stories in a comma delimeted text file and a url like so..<p>
