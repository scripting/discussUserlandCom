Tonto is a small helper appliation for Frontier (currently for the Mac only). Register scripts with Frontier, and Tonto provides a floating window containing buttons (with icons, captions, or both) which activate those scripts when clicked.<p>

This may be the final beta version of Tonto, it's quite solid. Final release is planned for the week of January 10, 1999.<p>
