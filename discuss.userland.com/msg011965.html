The answer is 'Yes'. I'm using it for notification of the completion of long-running tasks on the server, such as rebuilding a glossary: I make a request which starts that process, when it's done, it calls back to Frontier on my desktop box. If the asynch mechanism breaks, I've got problems.<p>

Please keep me informed of anything which might break this "vanilla" application of the asynch mechanism.
