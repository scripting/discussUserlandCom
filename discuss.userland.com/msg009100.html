No one elected him, but no one can take his place either.<p>

I'm not siding with him, I'm not disagreeing with him or with anyone posting here.<p>

I wouldn't call anyone a farce. That said, some of what ESR and some of what RMS (Richard Stallman) have to say can be divisive and perhaps unfortunate in their extremism.<p>

At the core of these kinds of statements is the debate between Open Source and Free Software -- hard to distinguish camps that oppose so-called closed software. We don't need to have this debate here, it rages on elsewhere. I don't think it's necessarily a big deal to most of the community (the silent majority), by that I mean it's not a matter of life or death whether it's open source or free software, and whether closed software is exterminated or not.<p>

Some of this debate has the tone of "Four legs good, two legs bad." If you don't know what I'm talking about or don't agree, read (or reread) Animal Farm.
