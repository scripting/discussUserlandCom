Deep linking is a legally murky area. So, by extension, is the syndication of deep links, which is what we at Moreover.com do.<p>

I was glad to see the InfoWorld article, which shows the way the tide is turning...

But, putting aside that debate, here's what we're trying to do: bridge the worlds of html and xml news.<p>

There's all that great content out there, in messy html. At Moreover.com, we've tried to translate, not everything, but the headlines at least.<p>

It's been a year's work, defining individual templates for every single source we harvest.<p>

If we and others can repurpose this legacy html content, on the industrial scale we're attempting, then xml can really take off.<p>
