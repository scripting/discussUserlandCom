My bullet point list:
<ul>
<li> Story Server can run on stonking great Solaris boxen for very high load sites
<li> SS provides an API for personalisation
<li> SS provides an API for workflow and content management, including launch, expiry, ownership and versioning
<li> SS processes embedded TCL a la Cold Fusion or ASP or any other server-parsed markup.
<li> SS has some nice builtin functions that are the equivalent to, say, the CGI.pm perl module, or the cgi Python library.
</ul><p>

It looks to me like Story Server is fundamentally a series of hacks to build a content management system out of server side includes and server-parsed Tcl in HTML. It's what the thoughtful Unix person would have done. Working with Story Server requires careful thought, care and feeding, it's an engineer's system. <p>

Things that really annoy me:
<ul>
<li>it uses an older Tcl - 7.6 - instead of the latest Tcl
<li>Tcl is hard to grok at first for people used to C-like languages
<li>the coding tools suck
<li>the server-parsing isn't that hot, leading to performance issues and really weird name-space issues.
<li>the price is incredible. SS is good, but it's not THAT good. OTOH, the telco I'm contracting at at the moment simply doesn't care.
</ul><p>

Things I like:<p>

<ul>
<li>a really sophisticated caching strategy. Templates can include components which can include components , and so on, and these can all have their own independant caching strategies
<li>different parts of a Story Server instance - the database, the Application Server, the caching manager, whatever - can all run on different boxen.
<li> lots of great hand-holding from the vendor.
</ul><p>

Why are they so different to Userland in their approach and philosophy? My guess is that they see themselves in a whole different market and problem space. BIG corporates, big hardware, big licensing fees. They're after the top 5%.
