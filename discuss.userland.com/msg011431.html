Their previous forays into UNIX environments suggest that alternative solutions are pretty messy: the Solaris version of IE4, for instance, installs a huge directory of hacked-up DLLs. Though I've not used it, reports on its release suggested that it wasn't worth the effort.<p>

If Microsoft are looking for portability, then they're likely to have to follow the path of Corel in embracing the WINE libraries, or produce something similar. Which brings up various Open Source licensing issues. In effect, the question isn't necessarily whether MS should develop for Linux, but rather, whether it can. Which perhaps accounts for the latest push towards distributed process-handling.
