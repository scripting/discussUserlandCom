Just out of curiousity, how long did Fortran and COBOL take to hit the mainstream?<p>

I've heard similar comments regarding HW lab-to-commercial figures being 10-15 years - the pace seems to be accelerating.  Is the pace in programming technologies accelerating as well?<p>

As for ODB's - they certainly existed commercially in the very late 80's, when was the initial research done?  Early 80's?<p>

Hmmm - Linda was proposed over 20 years ago, does JavaSpaces/Jini make it mainstream?<p>

As for Scripting, REXX has been available on all IBM platforms since 1979. It is a true scripting language.  It's predecessors, EXEC and EXEC 2 - akin to .bats on DOS, were there for at least a decade before REXX - although you might not call them true scripting 
languages. Seems like 20 years of scripting to me - minimally.
