Sonic Solutions is the world's leading expert in DVD authoring and cd premastering. For the first time, Sonic will be making some of its software-only based products available on the internet. We are currently working internally on a Frontier-based project which will allow potential buyers to purchase online and we are actively seeking Frontier developers who will be able to assist in the process.
