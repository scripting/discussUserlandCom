Well, wouldn't you know it, that's exactly the sort of product that Catch The Web has decided to offer.</I><p>

Actually, it's already in existance, except it's done over the Interet via mammoth servers.  <A HREF="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</A> caches pages on their service, and if you get a 404 on a page request, can fill it from their cache.  It doesn't modify the <I>page</I> persay, but I daresay it modifies the <I>site</I> by allowing access to deleted pages.<p>

(In terms of manipulating the web in ways the author didn't intend, I don't know what frontier has been left unexplored at this point, and most people are throughly unaware it's happen<I>ed</I>, let alone happen<I>ing</I> (Alexa claims 3 million downloads, yet you've evidently never heard of it). About the only thing left is a Third-Voice style thing that just flatly modifies pages.... that would be a censoring program, most likely, and it would boast as a feature that it doesn't block whole pages, but tries to salvage the content... anyone know if this already exists?)
