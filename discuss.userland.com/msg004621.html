I don't want the source to Windows. I don't want Red Hat Windows or some other offshoot brand. I don't want Windows at all.<p>

Allowing me to buy N different versions of Windows from N different companies does not solve the problem that it is practically impossible for me to buy a computer without paying for a copy of Windows that I do not want. Also, I don't want people to think that licensing the Windows source code will make Microsoft's stranglehold on the computer industry just disappear; I think the discriminatory pricing and exclusive contracts are far more dangerous than the hidden APIs.
