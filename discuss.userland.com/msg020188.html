As Eric and Brett have pointed out, these licenses already exist, they are the MIT, X, and new-BSD licenses.<p>

David Adams suggested a "new" GPL without the preamble and such, is that what you're thinking of?  A "...any changes you make and redistribute must also be open source" (LGPL) or "...any changes you make and any code that builds on this code and is redistributed must also be open source" (GPL) type license?<p>

I would anticipate that Brett would disagree with the latter because they cause the same theoretical problem with economics that Brett suggests that the GPL already does.
