That's the only reason I include this part.<p>

Josh Allen: <i>
One example is television. By the time someone reaches the
age of Mr. Rogers, how much television have they watched?</i><p>

Hard to say.  I'm two years younger than Dave Rogers.  (Or did
you mean the other Rogers, with the TV show? :-)  I've seen about
as much television as, say, an average 24 year old.  I stopped
watching in high school, and resumed sporadically years later,
mostly for movies.  I can't stomach situation comedies.
(Seinfeld who?)<p>

Josh Allen: <i>
Except on a sophomoric level, would anyone really confuse
watching TV with any really useful experience.</i><p>

Useful experience requires making choices and being analytical
about what happens.  A mix of both is best, since only choosing
or analyzing alone has diminishing returns.  There's not much scope
for that in TV, but maybe some.  (Professional visual authoring
types might get more stimulus from TV analysis.)<p>

Josh Allen: <i>
Another problem with the whole age card is that it is quite
possible to gather wisdom from the experiences of others.</i><p>

Yes, that works. Civilization rides on that working well.<p>

Josh Allen: <i>
By the same token, if you take Karl Poppers "I might be wrong"
to the extremes, you end up with pure relativism
and this useless idea that truth is relative.</i><p>

I give folks many reasons to think me a relativist.  But
I've actually been exploring a middle ground between
objective and relative perspectives which emphasizes context.
Since this doesn't fit into a traditional category, it seems
to puzzle folks often.  (Is the value of a chess piece
absolute or relative?)<p>

Josh Allen: <i>
As people get older, I think they often ossify and move toward
the other extreme.</i><p>

If older folks got really strange, it might be hard to detect
this.  Any sufficiently flexible person might be labeled as
a simple anarchist if they defy easy categorization.  (I like
to play with other folks' taxonomies, the way some boys might
like to pull the wings from flies. :-)<p>

Josh Allen: <i>
Is it better to seek experiences that might challenge your wisdom,
or seek validation for your wisdom by adding supporting
experiences to the feedback loop? I think both are necessary.
I also think it would take a pretty pompous person to say that
they know what the best balance is.</i><p>

I'm not sure what wisdom is, and I don't know if it correlates
with age a lot.  Most folks who ever struck me as wise seemed
that way when younger, and just go more so over time.  At
some point it reaches a threshold that makes it remarkable
enough to be more interesting.  Others develop the ability to
express what they know when the get older.  Heck, it varies
so much, I give up. :-)
