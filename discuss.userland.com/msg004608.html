I'm really going to have to agree with Dave on this one, I've been coding sites for a long time, and I'm still waiting for a browser that fully implements the complete HTML 2 feature set:<p>

Bad things that still happen:
[note: when I say 'no browser', I mean no browser that any of my clients would care about]<p>

1. No browser acutally ignores white space completely. This has been in the HTML spec from the beginning.<p>

2. No browser implements tables corretly. In fact, Netscape, which was the first browser to support tables is actually worse than IE at this point. Try to create a table with the width and height tags in place but no contents at all.<p>

3. No browser supports the full implementation of PNG, a standard that is both superior to existing bitmap [gif, jpeg] formats in features [file size, alpha channel] but is also completely free.<p>

4. Ditto for CSS.<p>

  The fact of the matter is, if Netscape and Microsoft both stopped trying to take over your computer and make the web a 'richer' place and got their acts together on *existing* technologies, us graphic designers would stop annoying you backend people because something was 'one pixel off' [I can't tell you how many times I've had to say that]. Even if they just got tables right it would be a boon to all of us. And I can't even start telling you the kinds of benefits being able to layer alpha-channeled graphics could have for interface design.<p>

  Dave's also right about <textarea>...<p>
