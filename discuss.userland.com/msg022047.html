The real Dale comes out swinging. It's amazing to me that Jakob Nielsen inspires such passion. User interface guidelines, imho, are a good thing. In 1984 I had a similar pov to Dale's. But then I saw the good in standardized UIs. Not every programmer has ideas about user interface, or sometimes they have really bad ideas. The problem of course is that the Web is such a weak UI environment that even if you follow Jakob's rules (some of which I totally reject, btw) you end up with a weak user interface. Whatever. It's nice to see Dale come out of his shell.<br><br><b>Late night stuff<a name="lateNightStuff">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/11#lateNightStuff" title="Permanent link to 'Late night stuff' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'Late night stuff' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.inside.com/jcs/Story?article_id=20419&pod_id=9">Inside.Com</a> on the Future of Music Summit and Senator Hatch, with a touch of John Perry Barlow.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.evhead.com/?archive=2001_01_01_ev.xml#1926999">Evhead</a>: "Building stuff is fun!"
