I'm not sure I understand this.  Shouldn't politicians represent the citizenry, whether or not they vote?  It's not quite the same, but I'm always cautious when a politician says they represent "tax-payers" -- I feel that they represent all citizens, especially non-tax-payers.  Similarly, they should represent all citizens, not just those who vote -- there are hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised people, not just those who choose not to vote.
