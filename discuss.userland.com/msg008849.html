That said, let me piss a few people off . . .<p>

Worries about Matt's writing:
Matt has written some really good tutorials, a thorough *reference* book, has personally e-mailed me with helpful tips, and I like him.  But there are two reasons why Frontier hasn't taken off the way it should have--bad documentation and no marketing.  <p>

"The Book" is not a book with which (almost) anyone but a fairly seasoned programmer would successfully learn Frontier.  If "The Book" was written with the goal of serving as a reference manual, so be it.  But if Matt wrote it with hopes it serving principally as the best way to learn Frontier, then I am very worried.  Writing good learning material requires understanding the basics of how people learn.  The Book (as well all know) did not display a mastery of this.  If UserLand is in need of help in this area, then one might suggest a company called Information Mapping that teaches almost all of the big silicon valley tech writers how to set up good documentation based upon good cognitive research about how people learn.<p>

So, I'm worried about Matt's writing because his knowledge of Frontier is often put on display in the steel grids of organized details, not in easily-learned prose.  And it doesn't have to be difficult material right?  Because, after all, Frontier has reasonable, intuitive ways to help you get what you want done.  And easily-understandable documentation is what will increase the Frontier base of users.  <p>

This isn't rocket science.  Imagine that you're considering a new language/development environment to learn.  You walk down to Borders book store and browse through a couple of dozen beginning-Perl books and then you browse through ch. 41 of Matt's Book.  It's no contest.  You choose Perl unless you have an abundance of faith or are in need of a pet research project.  We have made the minority choice; we *are* the faithful and the hardy.  Yes, there's on-line documentation.  Now let me see a show of hands:  How many people prefer on-line documentation over a book?  That's what I thought, 1 out of 4000.  I looked at the on-line documentation for how to set up the discussion groups I need to build.  I still don't have much of a clue. <p>

That critical MacWorld review of Frontier's bad documentation wasn't an anomoly.  Now, if UserLand is going to address this problem, do it in a way that will create a good, readable, book that will show the strength and utility and usability of Frontier.<p>

Now, I'm sure that as a result of this rant I've decreased the liklihood of getting any help through the mailing lists, but it had to be said. I hate to see such a great product wasting away only because so few know about it (no marketing) and of those that do know about it, only 5% have succeed it making it through the learning curve to do anything with it (lack of accessible documentation).<p>
