It's realy rare for all the messages of a particular day to be deleted, causing the calender to have a link to an empty day (and if this realy was a problem, it would be easy to modify the code to solve it).<p>

What I was trying to hint at, is that while the Frontier odb is a excellent place to store data (with a structure that often is more suited for the web than the internal structure of a relational database), the sql databases still has some advantages when you want to get the data back - since the sql bases has a more mature indexing.<p>

This is obviusly not a problem for well defined structures like the discussion group. I used it as an example to show that already there the problems with keeping an index in sync shows up. <p>

In the thread "Discussion group interface troubles" there is wishes (sorting by authour, subject etc) that I think will require indexes. Can it be done in Frontier? Naturally, there is nothing mystical with indexes, they can just be tricky to keep in sync in an efficient manner.
