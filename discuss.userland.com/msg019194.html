But there's more to it. There was a song, I forget who wrote it, that went like this: "Your cash ain't nothing but trash."<p>

And it's true. If I can't use money to buy what I want, what use is it? <p>

Also, I learned in massage training to try to give the client what they're asking for, instead of erecting barriers that come from inside you. Ask the question "Can I do what they're asking me to do?" And if the answer is yes, consider the idea of just doing it.<p>

This is called submission, and it's another kind of freedom. You want my money, OK, here you go, now what?<p>
