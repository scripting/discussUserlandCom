Subject: cache control defect IE 4.5 Macintosh<p>

IE 4.5 Macintosh does not honor HTTP cache control headers. My server is sending the header<p>

Cache-Control: No-Cache<p>

with the original page load, yet IE displays the cached page for subsequent page loads (at least when the access time between page loads is relatively small). For example, if I click on a link to a no-cache page, hit back, and then click on the link again, IE does not re-request the page. This is the case even though I have my preference setting to update the cache "Always" (advanced settings).<p>

I have tried Max-Age=0 as the cache control directive, but the problem is the same. IE also shows a cached page if I send an "Expires" directive with a date far in the past. IE 4.0 and 5.0 on Windows appear to handle the cache control directives correctly.<p>

Thanks for your help in resolving this. This issue makes it impossible to use IE on the Mac for interactive database applications.<p>

Let me know if I can provide further information,<p>
