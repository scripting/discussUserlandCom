On the FoRK mail list, Lucas Gonze said: "Don't know if it's about being a benevolent dictator so much as a conscientious slave. Open source is a lot of hours for no pay."<p>

I suppose there's no arguing with the truth of that statement.<p>

But would it be safe to conclude that this is <i>only</i> true of open source?<p>

I would argue not. I have worked a lot of hours on Frontier, a commercial product, with no pay, for twelve years. I'd say that puts me squarely in the "conscientious slave" club.<p>

Another person on the FoRK list, presumably a programmer and therefore a mathematician called my product "closed source".<p>

That's laughable! How could it be that my product is closed source when I ship so much source?
