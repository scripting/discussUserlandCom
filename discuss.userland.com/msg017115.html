Using 20/20 hindisght, Bill says we could have never developed windows if we did not link Office and the OS.<p>

Umm, Bill. Is this the briar rabbit defense? "Don't throw me into the briar patch" You just stated that the OS and the largest selling applications product are tightly linked, if not integrated, and that MS applications code is integrated into the OS on a regular basis.<p>

With statements like that, I'm sure Boies would like to have you up on the stand, as his witness, now that he has the findings of fact in hand.<p>

Would any other application developers code be intergrated into the OS? (oops, stac's was)<p>

Would any other applications developers code be hindered by such integration (or by directives for the CEO)? (humm, anyone for Java)<p>

When do you determine it's beneficial to move applications code into the OS, and when is it not beneficial? (when you sell office for an extra $200).
 <p>

How about a bit more hindsight? Without Steve Jobs, you might not have developed windows, excel, bought powerpoint, developed visual basic, or the visual IDE environement.
