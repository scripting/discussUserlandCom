You don't have to know html, though the HTML it generates on its own is pretty basic.  You start a new page by editing an exiting page and putting the link in '*' like *my new page*.  Then when you save that page you have a new link that when clicked opens up for editing your new page.<p>

Oh yea, Squeak is bit for bit compatible on a load of systems, Macs, Win32, Unixes of various sorts, WinCE, etc and any of these systems can run a Swiki with networking.
