fwiw, the <a href="http://www.cheiron.se">Swedish production
team</a> that writes their music probably earn more 
<a href="http://www.ft.com/ftsurveys/country/sc32fe.htm">money</a>
than the "boys" themselves...<p>

...and they wouldn't do that if their product didn't have
exactly the right quality for their intended market.  how
about a little respect for people who happen to work in
another profession?  the team behind BSB and many others
aren't exactly a bunch of clueless amateurs...<p>

<i>you can use the reputation garnered on the Internet to sell ancillary products</i><p>

on the other hand, chances are that someone else will give
away the things *you* plan to sell...<p>

...<p>

(And besides, "works for me" doesn't mean that things will
scale.  It's like the guy I saw on "lifestyles of the rich
and famous" who seriously thought that if everyone in the
world wrote books about how to become rich and famous,
everyone would become rich and famous.  After all, that was
what he'd done...)
