Is a newer version available?</i><p>

No, we currently don't have a carbonized version of menu-sharing.c.<p>

<i>Has anyone looked at whether menusharing support makes sense on Mac OS X?</i><p>

I'm not too familiar with our implementation of menu sharing and I haven't tried it, but based on the Carbon spec my guess is that it should continue to work.
