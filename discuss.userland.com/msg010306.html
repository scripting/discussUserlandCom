It was reported here as a rumor a few days ago.<p>

Seybold would be the right place to announce this.<p>

They've just spent two years re-engineering AppleScript, so this might actually go somewhere.<p>

The Seybold crowd <i>loves</i> AppleScript.<p>

It would get Apple's logo onto Windows in a new way.<p>

Why not do it?<p>

PS: Apple is sure to announce a new publishing professonal's desktop. That's where the margins are. And Seybold loves to buy new Mac hardware.
