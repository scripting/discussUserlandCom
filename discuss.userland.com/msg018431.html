  I am excited about the replies.<p>

  Since <p>

  a) "a working prototype is worth more than any number of theories..." and<p>

  b) I also think that many of the questions/issues raised will get answered if a prototype is implemented...<p>

  I would greatly appreciate if someone can help with the following and I am willing to learn and program on top of it... I used to program in C 5 years ago and am confident that I can read code and learn tcl,perl, etc...<p>

  [ I have access to 50+ MB at carnatic.com (Unix host) ]<p>

  1) a method for user sign up and login...<p>

  2) administration of two tables by user who has logged in<p>

  a) people - name, email, password, personal website, comments/description<p>

  b) people people interest - ppi - people(email), teacher(email), one word/category describing interest ( for eg., XML ), a number ( 1 to 100 that signifies how much the person values his teacher), detail comments ( why does the person think so ? )<p>

  c) generating html based on the above tables...<p>

-- <p>

how will the 2 tables look like ...

some more features/restrictions that can be programmed even at the very beginning...<p>

1) the category / interest area can be defined or existing hierarchy can be used from dmoz.org<p>

2) every person can either assign unique numbers to his teachers across all teachers or across one interest area / keyword and teachers - in the above example... i could set 1 for all the 4 records or 1,2,3,4 as above... this just helps in zooming on people's interests...<p>

given a choice... is xml or productivity or usability important to me...<p>

--<p>

Donot hesitate to ask me for clarifications. I hope that it is possible to develop a prototype soon...<p>

Peace , Kishore.<p>

ps: to begin with... we can have 2 tables... but what if _everyone_ starts becoming a member :-) [ because who knows... this tool will become the next yahoo... napster... ]<p>

we could probably split and create several tables based on year of birth or year/month of birth
