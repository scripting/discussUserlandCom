I've sent what I've got to Oliver and one other.<p>

I'm afraid it's very much a work in progress.  I've got Frontier connecting to mySQL via TCP/IP, opening a database, and sending SQL commands and getting the results back.  What I didn't get around to is the unpacking of the received data into something useful.<p>

What I was doing at the time was a feasibility study and proving that it could be done (and that I could do it) and that the performance would be good.  Doing the actual decoding of the returned data was something left for the actual project (which didn't eventuate).<p>

With mySQL running on a P100 and Frontier 5 on a Mac 8500, it took 83 ticks (1.4 seconds) to make 100 simple SQL queries in a loop, and the complete time including opening the TCP stream, logging onto mySQL, connecting to a database, doing the 100 queries, logging off and disconnecting was 138 ticks (2.3 seconds).  I thought that was pretty good.
