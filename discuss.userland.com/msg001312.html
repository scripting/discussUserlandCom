Care to tell us how him having sex with an intern threatens our economic status in the world market? In case you haven't noticed most of Europe seems to think we're all being silly for bothering with this in the first place. If anything it's Clintons attackers who are doing a brilliant job making sure the rest of the world knows we're stupid Americans.<p>

I don't condone lies under oath, but i also don't condone making a mountain out of a molehill, especially when the american people are spending millions of dollars to do it. And you know what, even if it's sexual harassment that is getting him in trouble I still don't think it's worth spending all this time and money on.<p>

And what's this "tarnish the office of the president" stuff about. This is not an issues of morality. If you want to make it one then that's fine, but morality never seems to be a qualification for political office nor does it have much bearing in the judicial system unless it falls under the constitution.<p>

So he didn't want to go to war. Where's the problem. The phrase "Duty, Honor, Country" positively REEKS of nationalism. One of the single most historically destructive forces. When people band together over their country they commit horrible atrocities and wipe other nations out in the name of their country. Besides, willingness to die for a cause is hardly the ultimate sacrifice. What about living for your cause?
