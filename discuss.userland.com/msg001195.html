There's one important new feature, in addition to being able to log to an outline or to a text file, it can also log to a guest database in the Frontier Files folder (you need Frontier.getSubFolder, also available here).<p>

The intention is that when running on a server you will only log to a guest database. We are going to analyze the performance in this case, and optimize as necessary. If you're interested in logging code and you're running servers, you're welcome to add your comments, based on the code here. <p>
