I would love to have a powerful and rich GUI tool for creating, editing, and publishing documents live to a web server. I'm thinking of something like HomeSite/BBEdit in my web browser. Or perhaps something like the Frontier outliner. This is a tool that I and other authors and publishers would use (and a Java applet isn't what I want), but regular readers would not.<p>

Just because I have a powerful GUI for authoring, one that requires broadband, doesn't mean I should use a similarly demanding interface for viewing documents. Consider the Userland discussions. I like the simple faster interface for reading messages, but I could see having a richer broadband interface for creating and editing messages. <p>

And I do have high speed access. Have for a long time now. I live in what most people would call a technological backwater -- Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (treat yourself to a big cappucino if you know where that is) -- but have had high speed access via ADSL for 2 years and cable modem access for 18 months. ADSL was initially $100 CDN a month (about $70 US). It's now about $60 CDN a month. The cable modems are even cheaper -- <b>$40 CDN</b> a month, or about $28 US.
