They pretty much cover their ass on that basis. Their user agreement says that people are not allowed to post defamatory, obscene or illegal comments on other people's websites. I assume their lawyers anticipated a lawsuit and want to be clear that they made their service for only polite and thoughtful people. Except their public statements counter that. I think they're on shaky ground.
