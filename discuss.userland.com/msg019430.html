In Mike Cornal's <a href=http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-07-25-001-07-OP-SM>article</a>, he sounds so much like Breznhev in the classic joke that it had me rolling in the aisles.
<p>
<p>
A train was stalled on the Trans-Siberian Railway, on board were Lenin, Stalin, Khruschev and Breznhev.
<p>
Lenin says "I shall fix this problem.  When the workers hear me speak, they will be inspired to make the train move."
<p>
The train doesn't move.
<p>
Stalin stands up and says, "I shall make this train move." He leaves the car
and returns a few minutes later.  "I've shot the engineer," he says as he
sits down. The train still doesn't move.
<p>
Khruschev then stands up and says, "I shall make this train move." He leaves
the car and returns a few minutes later. "I've reinstated the engineer,
posthumously," he says as he sits down.  The train doesn't move.
<p>
Breznhev then says "Let us close the curtains and make train noises."
