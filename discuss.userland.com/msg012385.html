We have some experience in this subject over in Zope.  Historically 
we've been out in front in thinking about the web as a big object 
system, treating URLs as nested object calls that pass (and marshal) 
arguments into methods.  For us, XML-RPC takes this Zope benefit 
and extends it beyond web browsers and into other programming 
languages and applications.  It's a platform thing.<p>

In Zope 2 we finally added our multiprotocol, concurrent server 
(ZServer).  With it the same transactional object system can be 
reached by HTTP, FTP, a telnet-like protocol, XML-RPC, WebDAV, 
FastCGI, PCGI, etc.  Some folks are working on adding IMAP as a 
protocol.  Application developers <i>for the most part</i> don't 
have to do anything special to make their objects available for 
different publishing systems.<p>

One of the prime reasons to do FTP was to allow web editing tools 
like Dreamweaver and development tools like Emacs/ange-ftp to 
play ball.<p>

The moral: FTP is not a distributed object system.  This makes 
using a rich object system via FTP into an underwhelming experience.<p>

The very first thing you notice is that FTP doesn't have anything 
like Content-Type.  This makes client and server interpretation of 
what the damn resource is into a guessing games of filename semantics. 
As an object guy, I just hate the crap out of that.<p>

Next, FTP doesn't have a transparent security system.  I really like 
the progression of techniques in HTTP, from Basic Auth, to Digest 
Auth, to SSL 2, to SSL and client-side certificates.  For the most 
part this is all transparent to application developers, as it is 
part of the protocol negotiation instead of the payload.<p>

How about other request/response semantics?  Well, FTP gives you 
no request semantics, other than the operation, and one 
response semantic, being the response code.  HTTP has a rich and 
extensible set of headers for both the request and response 
negotiation.  Someone in the Zope community is working on adding an 
"XMLRPCMethod" product to Zope with caching in it.  He wants to 
let the server express caching policies to the client.  HTTP already 
has a facility for this.<p>

Thus, I take issue with Dan Lyke's assertion of: "it's a 
reimplementation of systems for which perfectly serviceable 
protocols already exist."  While it is true that FTP, SMTP, NNTP, 
et al. have spent decades covering important territory, there is 
definate lossage in viewing them as transports for a rich object 
model.<p>

I'll also take issue with Dave's last sentence above about HTTP 
POST.  Looking at the HTTP methods that WebDAV adds, well, there 
are a lot of interesting verbs there besides POST, such as 
discovery of properties, etc.<p>

That's it for now.</i></i>
