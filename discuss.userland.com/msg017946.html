They've re-focused my feelings about Napster.  I've been amazed and pleased by it and also repulsed and frightened.  And I'm not even in the music business!<p>

It seems to me that the main problem with Napster is its randomness.  Sometimes songs that I'd want to hear would be there, sometimes they wouldn't.  <p>

This reminds me of my reaction to good content early in the life of the web -- I would reflexively download it to my computer so I would always have access to it.  Then I started emailing links to myself.  More recently, I threw it up on my weblog, or just trusted my brain to remember the subject and the search engine to find it.  <p>

Some of this change is due to bandwidth.  At 14.4, I didn't want to download anything twice.  Even with DSL, I don't want to d/l an MP3 more than once, especially when I don't know if it'll be there in the next minute.  <p>

But look forward a bit: more bandwidth, stronger Napster network effects.  This means every song you'd ever want lives somewhere on the net and it takes a few seconds to d/l.  Which means that you probably won't bother, you'll just listen.  <p>

So, I think that a glimmer of hope remains for the music business, but it would require them to open up.  There's no hope for the current system, thank goodness!<p>
