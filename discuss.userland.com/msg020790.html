Scour can claim they are just a search engine, and drop the peer to peer capabilities.<p>

I've just discovered echo (<a href="http://www.echo.com/index_invitation.jsp?ref=95820"
>www.echo.com</a>). Whereas I see radiouserland and others are my personal jukebox, I see echo as my personal radio station.<p>

I have my personal collection of music, it's just like a 200 cd changer on steriods. I hit the play button, and the music in the jukebox plays. <p>

But echo is the personal radio station. You have an idea what will be on a radio station when you tune it, but you will hopefully hear new stuff you like. You can create your own radio station. I've got a couple, one rock, one mellow. Really like the mellow one I setup. More variety to my taste, much like a few of the college radio programs, but this one is whenever I want it. <p>

The song catagories look like: echo suggests, heavy rotation (you say you like it), related to highly rated music, and random. If you don't like a song, and you are the only registered listener, then you can hit the skip button, and don't forget to drop the rating.<p>

You can listen to others radio stations, but you may not have full control.<p>

Interface is flash-based, with real player streaming.
The echo crowd is going to have a database that companies will drool over. Ratings of songs, artists and albums.<p>

What we really need, a mix of personal jukebox, search engine and random music. If you like an artist there really is not a way to just say let me hear more, it really is a radio station. And I'd really like to be able to donwload a radio station to a digital music player, and mark artists I want to hear more from.
