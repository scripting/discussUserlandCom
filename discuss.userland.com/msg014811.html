For "How can I drive Fireworks from another app?" there *is* a way to do this, via either AppleScript or command-line parameters on Windows (or drop a bunch of files and a JavaScript command file on the app itself). <p>

The key is that both Dreamweaver and Fireworks have internal JavaScript interpreters, and in the 3.0 versions both have full document-object models. You can grab DOM commands from the History Panel and save them as a Fireworks Command file -- a JavaScript document with extension .JSF. You can also modify such captured JavaScript commands from the History Panel... all we'd need is that the final result be valid JavaScript that can be interpreted within Fireworks.<p>

Unfortunately a command captured from the History panel is not innately batch-able... it needs a bit of a wrapper to handle multiple files. I'm hoping to get this in as a Fireworks technote soon... one of the keywords will likely be "automation".<p>

Summary: I believe you'll be able to achieve what you wish, and I hope to have this documented within the next few weeks.<p>

(Hmm, in case I grabbed the wrong question and this is actually "How can I quickly upload a changed image file?" then I'd defer to your choice of FTP transfer utilities.)<p>
