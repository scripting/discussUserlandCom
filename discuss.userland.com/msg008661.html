The other problems are that this search engine requires you to register one page at a time (and only manually - not like the search.userland engine which allows submission through an xml-rpc interface), and currently xml documents are not heavily hyper-linked like html ones are, so growth of the index is going to be slow.  Of course when xlink arrives....
