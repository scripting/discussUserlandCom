Feel free to post feedback, folks; this is just another draft. As always, I speak for nobody but myself.<p>

<b>Short Version</b><p>

Open source software meets four major criteria:<p>

<ul>
<li>You can read the source.</li>
<li>You can modify the source.</li>
<li>You can share the source.</li>
<li>You can charge money for the source.</li>
</ul><p>

You're allowed to use your common sense. If you <i>intend</i> all of these things, then the actual license is mostly a technicality for the lawyers. If you patent your open source software (and you don't give your patents away to other developers), then your software isn't open source.<p>

If you release open source software, you're an open source developer. You don't need to agree with anybody's politics to be an open source developer--not Eric Raymond's, not Richard Stallman's, and not even Linus Torvalds'.<p>

<b>Long Version</b><p>

"Open source" is defined at greater length in the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">Open Source Definition</a> and the <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a> (scroll down).<p>

If you like everything all spelled out, with no appeals to common sense, then you should read these definitions. But if you prefer to rely on common sense, then you can use the short definition above.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
