Sounds daunting at first just to do a web log but probably people will create nice XSL and CSS tampltes for a specific XML-schema or DTD and you'll be able to use them as is or tweak as necessary. Then, hopefully your back to spending most or all of your time on content.<p>

I would think a scripting environment would be able to translate the XML into HTML via XSL since XSL is IE 5-only at the moment.<p>

ps  sites like this that call themselves "SiteExperts" seem to undermine themselves by having such a cruddy site.
