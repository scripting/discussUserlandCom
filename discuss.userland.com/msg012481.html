Nah. At least IMO, BSF and XML-RPC solve different problems. BSF is like Apple's OSA or MS's Active Scripting; it solves the problem of calling between different languages within one Java VM. I wouldn't want to do that with XML-RPC. BSF doesn't even try to solve the problem of doing RPCs across different computers (or even different VMs on the same computer).<p>

This is similar to the situation with KDE's DCOP. DCOP is a fast binary protocol, but it only works between apps that are connected to the same X server AFAIK. So you have a gateway and you get the advantages of both protocols.
