I knew that Josh Allen works for Microsoft (which I did not).
So now I will edit the potentially offensive parts, showing
the before and after versions for contrast.  The new "after"
version assumes Josh Allen is a Microsoft employee.<p>


Joshua Allen: <i>The rules of many sports allow you to 
interfere with the other team's ability to win.</i><p>

Before: <i>I don't see how this is relevant, no matter who
brought it up.
Seeing it feels like a red herring, like shouting Microsoft
does not discriminate against dirty socks. Uh, who cares?</i><p>

After:  I'm unable to relate the concept of impeding play
in others to anything I said before, so I'm confused.
And when I think about it, I can't work up any concern at all.
However, stopping them from playing is a big deal.  Giving the
other team's bus a flat tire so they miss the game is beyond
the pale.  Is this what we are talking about?<p>

Joshua Allen: <i>Obviously Microsoft believes that no 
infractions were committed </i><p>

Before: <i>Time out! Rather, Microsoft obviously believes they were
committed. But they strenuously deny them. No one believes this
position nor believes Microsoft takes the position seriously.
It's just a pro forma denial. When accused, one approach is to
deny everything and never stop denying under any circumstances. </i><p>

After: Until today, I never heard anyone utter that idea
seriously, except in the context of official Microsoft
position announcements.  With all due respect, I wish to
disagree without giving offense.  I'm sure many Microsoft
employees agree with this sentiment, and I don't mean to
call them liars by disagreeing.  As stated, the sentence only
makes sense with "obviously" removed, or with "says it" added
before "believes."
