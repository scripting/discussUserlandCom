Freelancers (and moonlighters) "bid" on the project. The site also hosts the freelancer's personal info so that the company posting the job request can see and compare bidders.<p>

Does such a site exist?  The only site I could find "like" this was 
<a href="http://www.freejob.com">http://www.freejob.com</a>
but it doesnt really allow you to "bid" on a job...
