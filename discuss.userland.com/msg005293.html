On Macintosh, at the bottom of a script window is a pop-up menu for choosing the language. Most systems also have AppleScript installed, so you can choose between UserTalk and AppleScript.<p>

Even though Windows Frontier doesn't have this same option, you can still call a VBScript, JScript, or PerlScript script from your web page by calling a Frontier script that calls it.<p>

And you can use VBScript to build glue for applications. Check out the winShell verbs, for instance. It would be great to see more glue, for Eudora, Outlook, Excel, Word, and so on.
