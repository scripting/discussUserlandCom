Dave, sometimes I just don't get where you're coming from.  You say that OpenSource keeps people from working with each other at the same time that you are working with the Zope people!  You know first hand that some OpenSource people can and do work with closed source.<p>

Making blanket statements that closed source software is all bad is wrong thinking.. but so is making blanket statements about open source (<i>especially</i> when you know better).
