I don't expect much from Sun or Microsoft, having attended developer conferences put on by both companies, both present the company line, presumably to developers who know that that's what they're getting. I think in Sun's case, they go out of their way to be partisan and inflamatory, and I wonder how many developers now feel that Sun is leading a good fight against an evil empire, or if they themselves are pretty evil in their approach.<p>

IBM has surprised me by being so active in the promotion of XML and recently SOAP. I keep looking for signs that IBM will zig to the Microsoft-Sun zag, but I don't see them doing that. Having Guy Kawasaki keynote is a pretty clear sign that this conference isn't serious about leadership in the developer community, Guy doesn't have much respect for geek stuff, it's a weird choice for a keynoter, but then Guy was the keynote at O'Reilly's open source convention last year, which left me shaking my head wondering what they're thinking over there at O'Reilly.<p>

Behind all this is my strong belief that this is the year for XML-over-HTTP. These technologies will certainly be covered at Microsoft's convention. In my humble opinion, at the other extreme, it should be covered and evangelized, in an open choice-oriented way to developers who value choice. Those clearly are not the Microsoft developers, and perhaps to a similar extent are not the Sun developers.<p>

But, the two conferences at the other extreme, O'Reilly and IBM, could benefit tremendously by offering a chance for these ideas to be evangelized to the people who attend their conferences.<p>

I also think it would be truly revolutionary if Microsoft and Sun did the same, but I don't think there's much chance of that.<p>

A bit rambly, but that's my thinking right now, and what's behind the questions I asked.
