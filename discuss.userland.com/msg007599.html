I've been working with people who just want to write and don't want to learn rules about writing. The last thing I want to do is to require that they learn how to markup in a new language. At least with HTML they can go to a local bookstore and choose from 100 different books on HTML. So a little markup is fine, like <i>italics</i> and <b>bold</b>, but even <a "http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/href"> boggles the mind of all but the most technical people.<p>

Second, if we're on the cusp of including stories in the <scriptingNews> format, this would be the wrong time to switch formats. How established is "XMLNews"? I don't know. Are there any publicly available XMLNews files that we can add to the flow? If so, I'd like to learn more about it that way.
