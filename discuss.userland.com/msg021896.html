Well I gotta say I was doing Unix pipes in the 1970s, and pipes are great, they're kind of like HTTP, they get you from point A to point B in a reliable way. The subject of Unix pipes even came up in the discussion I had with Udell. The next layer-up would be something like Windows Scripting Host, or Apple's Open Scripting Architecture, which would allow a common set of interfaces for embedding any scripting language/environment in a host app, like a Web server, or a paint program.<br><br>I added a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/whatIsScriptingNews#otherMottos">new section</a> to the What is Scripting News? page.<br><br><a href="http://www.daynotes.com/">The Daynotes Gang</a> is a cluster of webloggers. <br><br>Scott Loftesness started <a href="http://bluetooth.weblogs.com/">The Bluetooth Weblog</a>.

After "doing it" with your girlfriend, you're blissing out, not quite asleep, in a very private place. <br><br>	She scratches your back or kicks you in the butt. She wants to cuddle and "talk." This is the last thing you want to do. <br><br>	I wonder if all other guys have this experience? Perhaps women aren't built for this kind of bliss. The scratching and kicking and talking spoil the whole thing. If only women would listen. But us guys never want to talk about it, right? <br><br>	(This is one of those times when I'm glad the discussion group is taking a holiday.)<br><br>	Extra credit: <a href="http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/90q3/urinals.html">Male bathroom rules</a>.<br><br>
