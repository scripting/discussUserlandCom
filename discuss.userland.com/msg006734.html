We've been experimenting with using the Java version of VNC in our goal to provide one-click access to a technography session. Because of some Java security problems that Matt can tell you more about, we figured that the best way to accomplish this was to use my machine as a web server. Hence Apache (relatively small, relatively easy to install). I am pleased to announce that it worked brilliantly. As long as it was a one-to-one setting (I have yet to find a tool that would allow for point-to-multipoint application sharing) and there were no firewalls to deal with.<p>

Despite these problems, the tests were most convincing. The technologies we need for on-line technography are pretty much all in place. Enough to allow me to begin training people in the on-line technography methodology -- on-line, of course -- well, on two lines, one for voice and one for data. <p>

If anyone knows of any alternate technologies we should explore, I'd be most interested in hearing from you. If anyone is interested in developing on-line technography skills, this'd be a good time to contact me.
