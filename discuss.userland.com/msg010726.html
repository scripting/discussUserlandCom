You know, writing the first version of Python's xmlrpclib
took me about 20 minutes.  Thanks to the straightforward
design, it was possible to come up with a Python interface
that allows you to issue an arbitrary XML-RPC request from
any existing Python application to any XML-RPC server, with
three lines of Python.  No more, no less.<p>

As a result, dozens of people immediately picked up the ball
and started using it for really cool stuff.  Six months later,
thousands of Python programmers have downloaded the library,
and several major Python applications now provide XML-RPC
services.<p>

In contrast, there's still no freely available CORBA
implementation for Python.  The ones that do exist require
you to learn yet another language to write complicated
specifications in, run code generators on those specifications,
adapt your programming style to the CORBA framework, etc.  From
a scripting perspective, CORBA is stone-age technology.<p>

I'm not surprised that nobody's using it...
