This is distressing. Guha doesn't own RSS or RDF. He was one of 27+ contributors to RDF. The World Wide Web Consortium owns RDF just like it owns HTML. Why are you trashing someone who has worked hard to do good? There are 10 authors on the first draft of the RSS 1.0 spec. This will probably increase as others contribute. What's your beef with this guy? These people are giving of their talents freely. No one is being compensated for working on RSS 1.0. It is a labor of love.<p>

<p>Furthermore, you promised support of the new spec in the very beginning. What's happened now? You're not being supportive at all. You're personally attacking Guha. Lay off. Stop taking this so personally.
