I'm looking at the first claim. I don't think it represents a patent on CGI's in general. The langage is too specific. It seems to refer to a case in which a true object-oriented programming system is used, and the URL points to a class; an instance of the class is instantiated, a method is executed. State information is sent back to the client and used in the next call to the server.<p>

From my reading about Zope, which is an OO Python framework, I think this MAY be exactly what Zope does when it uses cookies for persistent sessions. I haven't used Zope though.<p>

Anybody know if this is correct?<p>

I'd be surprised if some Java frameworks didn't do the same thing. For instance, an obvious way to represent a Web page in an OO system is to make a class for it. Then, bringing a Web page up is instantiating a class instance; a particular method (function) is called depending on user input; etc.<p>

It's just a very obvious and convenient way to do things if you're building an OO system. If that's worthy of a patent, any randomly-chosen line of code in any program is equally worthy.<p>

As I've mentioned before, I'm not against software patents in general; just ludicrous ones, particularly when they're in the hands of companies that have the means and the will to not play fair.
