We're going to work to identify this issue for the industry and flush this bad practice from the popular news sites.<p>

In 1996 Marc Canter asked <a href="http://canter.com/dp/sunapple.html">Who Will Buy Apple</a>? <i>Requires Shockwave, of course.</i><p>

<a href="http://whois.userland.com/">A new URL</a> for our WhoIs server. I'm going to write a DaveNet piece about this tomorrow morning. I want to add a couple more features. It feels electric here today. <i>Lovin it!</i><p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3803">Ian Beatty discovers</a> a revolutionary yet unpublicized feature of Frontier 6. You can edit discussion group messages with Frontier's wrapping headlines outliner. It's all done with <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/rpc.html">smoke and mirrors</a>. As far as I know we're the first developer to so deeply integrate a workstation <a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/htmlinterfaces/nirvanaServerDiscuss/msgReader$22">editing tool</a> with a browser-based interface. This is just the beginning, and a large part of the reason it's so important that we're on both Mac and Windows. (Willie Sutton robbed banks because that's where the money is. People who write for the web are on Mac and Windows. That's a clue.)<p>

<a href="http://slashdot.org/ultramode.txt">Slashdot has a back-end view</a>, that's logically equivalent to the XML <a href="http://news.userland.com/mostRecentScriptingNews.xml">view</a> of Scripting News. <i>I smell convergence!</i><p>

<a href="http://www.menwithhill.com/">Menwith Hill</a> is the largest electronic monitoring station in the world. It is run by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which monitors the world's communication for US intelligence. Menwith Hill employs 1,200 US civilians and servicemen to work around the clock inside "hardened" buildings intercepting and analysing communications mainly from Europe, Russia and the Middle East. <p>

From the Cryptic Clue Department. 'Agents? That's the old stuff. <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn/?stage=1&word=angel">Angels</a>? In with the new!'<p>

<a href="http://www.zinezone.com/pubbin/login">ZineZone</a> lets you build your own Zine. Interesting. It's not what I thought it was. I thought it was competition for what we're building, but it's not. <i>Whew!</i><p>

Fortune: <a href="http://cgi.pathfinder.com/fortune/technology/daily">Non White-boy Venture Capital</a>. "Bucks Restaurant is still far and away the best place to see and be seen in the Valley; to survive here you must have at the very least a cell phone and a Palm Pilot; and venture capitalists, as a general rule, are white men between the ages of 35 and 50." <p>

Bucks is my favorite restaurant too. And we're doing their new website! <i>It's going to be coooool.</i><p>

One more thing, the Fortune link will be broken tomorrow. One of my pet peeves. A big site like Fortune should have a permanent home for the piece on the day the piece runs. The NY Times does this too. They screw the whole thing up, I only point to them when it's really worth it, I hate putting broken links in my archives. Further, they use a real CMS at Fortune, so they have to be able to do this right. Maybe Jakob Nielsen could add this to his list ways to avoid link-rot. It's certainly high on my list.<p>
