I agree that this is a great idea. In my opinion multiple discussion groups make it easier for participants to pick and choose what topics to follow. <p>

A home page describing the various discussion groups could be set up. A daily post on the main DG once a day listing the new postings on the other discussion groups would also be useful. Perhaps this could just be in the form of the number of new postings by active topic. <p>

As the DG becomes more popular, adding more focused DG's with some means of cross indexing seems like a reasonable approach. <p>

Just my 2 cents.
