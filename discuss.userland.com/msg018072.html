I recall Bill Gates saying about Ray Ozzie that Ozzie is one of very few true software geniuses. True. <p>

I have had far less contact with him than you but he is a man of real integrity. I sometimes see Gates, by contrast, as an Ozzie-type Jedi who was "turned" but who could still turn back without losing his "helmet" and his "life". But that's another story.<p>

My close contact at <a href="http://www.groove.net">Groove </a> swears they'll bring me in to do some stuff when there is a fit between their stuff and my skills. <p>

Between Notes, Frontier and Groove communities, I can map in the next few years ....<p>

If there are answers ready to be shared to some of the other questions, great. I'm far enough along I should have known better than to ask the big release question! In any case, hope to meet you for some gluttony in NYC after a trip this week to VA.
