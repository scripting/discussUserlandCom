I don't agree. I programmed "Weblogs.Com" to scan your Spotlighted Links page and added it to my favorites, and I am comfortable with the rate at which you update it, and I notice that you're updating it more recently now which is very good, but it would also be very good if you took a break.<p>

Re your reader's expectations, imho, I don't think you're doing them any favor by fitting into their idea of how often you should write. This will color the way I read you in the future, it's inevitable, I'd rather know that when I see an AlertBox it's because you had something important to say, not that some security-conscious nincompoop can't stand not hearing from you.<p>

It's funny I had a recent conversation exactly like this with Paolo Valdemarin in Trieste. I have it all the time with Bob Bierman, the one UserLand person who doesn't have a weblog. I had this kind of conversation with Andre and Brent, now who both have weblogs. Brent updates pretty much every day, Andre less regularly.<p>

The rule that it has to be updated on a regular basis is a myth, I believe.
