I've been ranting a long time about how much I hate working with the browsers.  Maybe Mozilla will change the way we work with the 'Net.  Maybe the web will just be about publishing and communication, and we can use Mozilla as the new uber-browser/UI for our applications (and of course, they'll be _web_ apps, but we'll drop the web part because it'll seem redundant).
