For example, i haven't ried this yet, but it seems like it would be perfectly suited to assist in QAing a web site. you could send out a bunch of beta testers and tell them to provide their feedback as ThirdVoice post-its. To make this really work, ThirdVoice would need to provide some extra capabilities like assigning IDs to notes and having a centralized listing of feedback that could take you right to the page. This might involve a version of the ThirdVoice server that you would install on your own machines, behind the firewall even if you were only having employees test. I think these types of corporate uses are where ThirdVoice could really shine.
