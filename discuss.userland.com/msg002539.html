A word of advice -- by avoiding the crawl stage, you
open a window of opportunity for those who might wish to spam your
index.  It's the same idea as the old trick of having a huge amount

Obviously this is not a problem for all applications, and obviously
one can filter incoming pages by whatever means desired, but it's
important to remain aware that filtering may be necessary.
