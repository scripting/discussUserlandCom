This the crux of the whole argument right here. If Apple does with Mac OS X what they have said they will, then Frontier will run as is. If you have a Mac, you'll be able to run Frontier. Now if you want to take advantage of all the buzzword features of the new OS then yes, you'll need to Carbonize the app, but that decision will be easier to evaluate once the OS is actually in the users hands.<p>

Linux, on the other hand, is here now being used by lots of people. I can only speak for myself, but if I could run Frontier on my Linux box it would definitely become my primary box.
