You must realize that it's a lot easier to complain than to praise, right?<p>

I absolutely <i>love</i> the userland sites!  You continously have me doing the "wow, this is cool -- I'm telling everybody I know" dance with all the things happening here.<p>

Yet you probably won't see this reflected in all of my posts to this DG.  The fact remains that random acts of kindness are not easy to do -- complaining, however, is <i>very</i> easy to do.<p>

I think, too, that there is a paradigm shift going on in thinking about complaints re: software.  You said:<p>

<i>Fredrik, we appreciate what you've done to make XML-RPC possible on Python. I would never think of complaining about the bugs in that code. I wouldn't even expect you to fix them, because I appreciate what you've done.</i><p>

This is where the shift is happening.  In the Open Source world, it is <i>expected</i> that you "complain" (i.e., report) all bugs!  If you were to use any of my programs, for instance, and you did not complain about the bugs you found, I would be offended!
