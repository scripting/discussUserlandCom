Second, One feature that I think should be implemented in either xml-rpc or wddx is the ability to add a definition of what the object requests for an rpc. This would aid in generating programs that could interface with eachother "on the fly" if you will. They would have to have general knowledge of how a what an object needed, but might be able to leave out "optional" data or automatically ask the user to supply details it doesn't "understand" in order to initiate the rpc. The idea is to make software backward/forward/laterally compatible. This would be tremendously useful in bioinformatics, allowing researchers to easily mix and match objects without writing data munging scripts.
