The thing that's great about Perl is that there is a module for doing just about anything.  Heck, Perl modules are the only real "re-usable code" that I've worked with.  And the CPAN listings make it fairly easy to find modules that do what you want.<p>

I think a simple directory of different types of scripts people have written would be great.  Have a set of top categories and perhaps a few sub-categories.  Then either have a link the page about the script or a local copy.<p>

Allow user to log in and upload their work, edit it, annotate it, etc.  I guess you could use the framework for the discussion board as a base for this.<p>

Dunno, just thinking out loud....
