Well, two things: first, I'm not sure I understand--seriously--what aspect of what I quoted before was new. You've always had a good point about your content on your server. The issue has always been what happens between server and browser. I've written quite a lot about SSL/TLS on the wire and digital certificate authentication--which, so far, no one has responded to.<p>

I'll be happy to reiterate the TLS/digital certificate ideas, but I think I've found a better one: see <<a href="http://www.waterken.com">http://www.waterken.com</a>> and follow the link to the "Beach Sex" demo. It's a great exposition of the ideas behind capability-based security and, importantly from an application point of view, Electronic Rights Transfer.<p>

My final point--and after this I promise I will shut up on the subject--is that instead of complaining about people taking advantage of the lack of security between server and browser, let's implement solutions to the problem. I have every reason to believe that implementing capability-based security and Electronic Rights Transfer in Frontier would be trivial.<p>

Thanks for the space,
Paul
