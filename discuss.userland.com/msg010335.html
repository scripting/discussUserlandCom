On Dave's urging, we're producing output of our news feeds for websites in xml as well as html. We = Moreover.com, an internet service which scrapes headline links from about 1,500 sources on the web, and across more than 150 categories of news. (We think that's more than anyone else out there.)<p>

There's background info at www.moreover.com/developers.htm - and examples of uses of Moreover.com XML feeds. Carmen's Headline Viewer, among others. But for the moment...<p>

Here's a sample newsfeed in RSS. The description tag contains source and time harvested...
<a href="http://www.moreover.com/cgi-local/page?index_wireless+rss">http://www.moreover.com/cgi-local/page?index_wireless+rss</a><p>

Here's the same content in our own XML, with source and time separated out... 
<a href="http://www.moreover.com/cgi-local/page?index_wireless+xml">http://www.moreover.com/cgi-local/page?index_wireless+xml</a><p>

And here's the html version, with links off to other Moreover.com services...
<a href="http://www.moreover.com/cgi-local/page?index_wireless">http://www.moreover.com/cgi-local/page?index_wireless</a><p>

Moreover.com produces custom feeds on request, but about 130 (soon to be 200) channels are available right now for anyone out there to harvest and integrate into their own site or application.<p>

Just replace "wireless" in the URLs above with one of the category titles, such as "communicationsequipment" below...<p>

For a full list of categories, see...
<a href="http://www.moreover.com/category_list.htm">http://www.moreover.com/category_list.htm</a><p>

As a taster, here are some of the tech categories...<p>

There are more formats and channels in the pipeline, but we'd really like your feedback. Email me at <a href="mailto:nick@moreover.com">nick@moreover.com</a> with your suggestions!<p>
