Maybe this is an unfashionable answer, but if you want archiving, I believe you'd be best off doing an actual site of your own and archiving your entries.<p>

From where I sit (that is, not affiliated with Userland), Dave & co. are getting into the watch-the-world and tell-the-world business, not the archive-the-world business.<p>

I could be wrong!
