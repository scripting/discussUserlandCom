If all the clients are on the same platform and the server on an other one (and you don't render on the server...) this is no big deal.<p>

But I still think something important for europeans (and others !) is missing here in WebEdit. It seems the DG has the required feature but that it was left out of WebEdit.<p>

A question to UserLand :<p>

Could some callbacks be added to the client side of WebEdit ?
