Does anyone know of an ISP who does? <p>

I'm shopping for an ISP and was seeing the "We host FrontPage98 Extensions" notices all over the place. Same sorts of notices for PERL and ColdFusion. <p>

Right now the licensing is all bundled together and I'd have to copy my binaries and database and referenced objects to the ISP's server to have them hosted. <p>

Suggestions?
