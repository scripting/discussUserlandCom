My goals are simple: the page should fit, horizontally, on printed paper.<p>

The graphics and grayscale text boxes should be readable.<p>

The type should not be too large or too small.<p>

I don't have control over page breaks, unfortunately, and different systems will break at different places. So I'm not concerned about that, since there's nothing I can do about it.<p>

The key point: it should be legible and clean.
