However, there is also a pretty strong feeling that the US is using it's position as the single superpower in the world to enforce whatever solution suits its national interests. <p>

One thing that has been absent in the US news is the fact that the Rambouillet (sp?) agreement contained an appendix about allowing NATO to transport troops and equipment all over Yugoslavia, using the roads, railways, airspace, harbours, etc. The difference between this and occupation is pretty slim, and hardly any western country would accept those conditions.<p>

So to force Milosevic to choose between the Rambouillet agreement and NATO air attacks was essentially the same as attacking right away. <p>

If this was a terrible mistake by NATO/USA or if they wanted to provoke an attack, I haven't got a clue. I doubt we'll ever know all the reasons behind this war.
