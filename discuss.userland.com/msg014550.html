He's hot to trot on FatBrain and iUniverse. I suggested we work out an easy path for editors to publish to print directly from their Manila sites. He was very excited by this idea. We'll talk again tomorrow.</i><p>

Just out of curiousity, and based on past experience... did Bill mention that he's a part owner of iUniverse?<p>

He had a habit in the past of raving about toExcel (which was bought by iUniverse) to computer book authors, talking about how wonderful print-on-demand would be and trying to get them to sign up, while neglecting to mention that he was a part owner. As a book agent, it seemed to me (and others) that there was a distinct conflict of interest there.<p>

[Disclosure: I used to be a client of Waterside (Bill's agency) and left after they got me no work. I moved to Studio B (the competition) and am now busy as a full time author. I also had a couple of bad experiences with Bill personally and with Waterside in general at their conference last year.]<p>

It's interesting to me how originally print-on-demand was expected to be huge in the computer book biz, until the authors read the fine print and all ran like hell in the opposite direction. Now, they're taking a completely different angle to try to make it succeed--I'm curious to see if it flies any better than the last.<p>
