Wow.<p>

I think these people are really onto something. I can now see why Andrew thinks that the SVG/XML/DOM alliance is going to be huge. Linking the power of Frontier (and other web-application development environments) to programable vector graphics formats is a pretty mind-blowing proposition<p>

The site gives no clue to how its all done at the back-end. Any ideas?<p>

At this stage I think the user interface and management is a bit too complicated and cute, but it has some interesting features that could be studied for future Manila upgrades - particularly how value-added services, such as discussion groups, can be 'plugged-in' and managed. Then again, I think the designers may have lifted more than a few idea's from Manila. Manila is certainly a far much more efficient and elegant 'writing tool'. And, let's not forget, there's no irritating aninmated advertisments to distract the user like there are on moonfruit. Don't need no plug-ins either.<p>

The service is a bit slow here in Australia (admittedly even from behind a university campus network) and it would be hopeless on older computers, however I can see these sort of high-bandwidth, all-singing-all-dancing vector-based services coming into their own with the wider introduction of ASDL etc. -  whose progress, I might add, is painfully slow here.
