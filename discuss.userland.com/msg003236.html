That aspect is internationalization. I worked for two years for a studio which did a <i>lot</i> of bilingual development, and this issue cropped up often- it's hard to maintain bilingual navigation, content, and functionality when developing fast-changing content on the web.<p>

I think Frontier could really shine in this area! Some thoughts:
<li>Take a page from OpenStep: Applications ship with "english.proj", "french.proj", etc. - resources bundled in the app. The app frameworks know how to fetch the appropriate resources based on user prefs.
<li>The first thing to do I guess would be to design a language framework. I think there are some folks working on working on this already, but I couldn't get through to the Script Meridian site to check their mailing list list.
<li>Once a framework has been developed, the website developer could seperate out appropriate bits and call, hypothetically, langauge.getCurrent()^.resourceTable.resourcename... or something like that. 
<li>Combined with "Scalable Content", this could really go a long way to helping those among us who are developing multi-lingual sites, and would add another level of customization to our code- someone could add language resources for some peice of functionality beyond what the developer had time/resources to do.<p>

I'm no CS major, and make no claims to being able to develop such a beast, but I have worked in a multi-lingual environment, am familiar with some of the issues, and would help out if I could.<p>
