The <i>other</i> direction is possible via a free extension written by Mark Aldritt of Late Night Software.<p>

From Mark's <a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/OSADreamweaver/index.html">read me</a>:<p>

<i>You can use AppleScript as part of any Dreamweaver Object, Behavior, Command or Translator... The OSA extension defines an OSA object within the Dreamweaver JavaScript object model.</i><p>

It seems that Macromedia would have to provide a minimal AppleEvent hook to allow a request from outside Dreamweaver. Something like a 'do script' event that would allow AppleScript or Frontier to call a Dreamweaver Command (ie javascript). That's how one can script Internet Explorer on the Mac -- great because you get the DOM.<p>

The same might be true for the HTTP capability in Dreamweaver 3. Many things may be possible if initiated from within Dreamweaver, but the opposite may not be possible. Would be way cool if I'm wrong, though!</i></a></i>
