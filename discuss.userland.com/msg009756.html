I want to suck the data out of the database. The only way (I believe) to do this would be to redirect output that is going from the printer to a file.<p>

Except, I don't know <i>how</i> I would do this. Does the UNIX Pipe system exist in the Windows world? How? Can I do what I stated above with a pipe, or would I have to do something else?<p>

Suggestions welcome.<p>

Thanks a lot,
