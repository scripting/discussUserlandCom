We accept that each of us may direct our own labor.  We accept that people somtimes sell their labor and sometimes share it with their friends and neighbors.<p>

People are often comfortable with important products of that labor (like food) being sometimes sold and somtimes given.  We don't call our neighbors communists if they leave a basket of tomatoes on our doorstep.<p>

I don't think you need to box the compass of moral argument to remind people that we may sometimes choose to give, and sometimes choose to sell our produce.  <p>

(This all only looks like a new kind of problem because the technology of the digital age lets us leave tomatoes on everybody's doorstep at once.)<p>
