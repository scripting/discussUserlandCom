Third voice has been getting website authors upset on most of the lists I belong to, ever since it came out. <p>

On A list Apart:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/archive/19990528_121212.html">May 28, 1999</a>, Julianne Chatelain said: "I'm sure those of you who have also played with TV will have more to

NET CULTURE (not to mention design & chaoos) implications of all this.
Red Herring says they don't have a business model but obviously the
business model is 'sell a server piece so I can control the notes on
my own pages.' "
<li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/archive/19990606_121212.html">June 6, 1999</a>, Michelle Moore said: "The site owners should have the ULTIMATE control over what is being viewed within their domain."

I don't know of any content creators who are in favor of the product, but I guess some folks enjoy using it!<p>
