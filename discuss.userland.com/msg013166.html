I've been experiencing some crashiness and realized that I've never used the idleTime INIT on a G3 or any OS more recent than OS 8.<p>

The version of idleTime INIT I have is 1.1, last modified June of 1998.<p>

I use Frontier 5.0.1 as a hobbiest.<p>

BTW, I've been away for a year... where did all the Frontier hobbiests go? ScriptMeridian used to be a resource for me. It's dead.<p>
