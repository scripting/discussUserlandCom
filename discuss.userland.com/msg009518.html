Instead I had been 2clicking on icons and ending up with lots of open windows. <p>

But as my Windows work has gotten more structured and I've been depending on the file system more for storage of lots of little files I've become a power user of the Explorer app. I like it, it grows on you.<p>

Now I may be one of a very small number of people who mastered the web before I mastered Windows, so this may sound like an oddball request, but:<p>

<i>I want a Favorites menu in the Explorer!</i><p>

It should be pretty obvious how that would work. Just like the one in MSIE. That's the suggestion. <p>

If Microsoft wants to show appreciation, give $100 to The Nature Conservancy.
