Firstly, because the vast majority of your peers are already doing the "service" thing and have done so since the dawn of computing. Most programmers do NOT sell their code - they work at banks, or insurence companies, or manufacturing companies, and so on, writing code to solve problems. For these people (who share code as a matter of course) the concept of selling code is completely alien, and the industry practice of selling licences or "seats" is viewed as intrinsically evil and a transient abarration.</i><p>
