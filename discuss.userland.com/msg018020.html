Came in this morning, and much to my surprise my IE favorites menu was a bit short, and had a dowwn arrow. Damn, I turned off that feature when I installed Office. Put the cursor on the down arrow, wait an eternity, and all the menu items appear, MS Office 2000 short menu style. MS integration strikes again. If there is one feature that cries out for a global kill switch, it's this one.<p>

Anyone in familiar with the OS will probably want to turn it off. Especially since there is no way that I can see to easily set the expansion to automaticly expand when over the down-arrow.<p>

Killing personalized menus, short menus, recently used only first, etc:<p>

<ul>
<li>Control panel, taskbar and start menus, select turn off personalized menus. 
 <li>Right-click on IE, select properties, Advanced tab. Under browsing, unclick enable personal favorites menu
<li>Open word, tools, customize, options, uncheck "Menus show recently first"</ul>
