I started to do something like this at Internet Alchemy with RSSMaker (<a href="http://alchemy.openjava.org">http://alchemy.openjava.org</a>). If you haven't seen it yet, RSSMaker creates RSS files from sites that don't yet publish their content in that format. (Some early examples I have running are BBC News, MTV News, Quote of the Day). These are fetched and generated every 2 hours at the moment. There are also a few 'raw' RSS files in there too - ones that are simply copied by RSSMaker and not parsed.<p>

I publish a list of these as an RSS file at <a href="http://alchemy.openjava.org/rss/index.rdf">http://alchemy.openjava.org/rss/index.rdf</a>. The advantage of using RSS over the userland service list is that it includes a short description of the RSS file. Also RSS is a format that is well handled by a number of programs now - it makes sense to reuse it. <p>

I note that there's no DTD specified in serviceList.xml - is there going to be one in the future? There is already a program that reads it (called Carmen's Headline Viewer - <a href="http://www.vertexdev.com/HeadlineViewer/">http://www.vertexdev.com/HeadlineViewer/</a>) so you need to be careful about changing the structure.<p>
