<i>If PNG was signifigantly better than GIF, I might feel better about taking the plunge and breaking compatibility with the ubiquitous GIF format, but its only virtue seems to be that it's not LZW.</i><p>

PNG offers better compression, more than 256 colors, and a real alpha channel (not just a single transparent "color"). It is unpatented and reference code is available. It does not, however, support animation. Overall, PNG is a better format than GIF, but it's not as widely supported.<p>

Unfortunately, browser support for PNG is marginal. Everybody has known about the Unisys patent since before Netscape 1.0, and the browser vendors have just started to implement alternatives.<p>

<i>That's why option 2, RLE GIF files, seems so satisfying. If word comes back from the patent lawyers that it's safe to use without paying Unisys, I would love to use it.</i><p>

The Unisys LZW patent does not (by any sane standard) have anything to do with run length encoding. Other RLE-related patents do exist, and may or may not be relevant. Of course, I'm not qualified to give you legal advice on this subject. :-)<p>
