I happened to find that recently too, but left as soon as I saw the licensing and pricing. "Freely available" it is not (in the Python sense). I'd rather do it myself; although I guess it must be non-trivial considering some C code was needed in addition to Python, and noticing no-one else has done it yet. I think that fact probably illustrates the point made that it's not well suited for scripting implementations, (even though I can't confirm on deny this through direct experience yet).
