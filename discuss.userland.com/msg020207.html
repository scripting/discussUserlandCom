<i>So, if passers-by on the sidewalk stop to admire my lawn, do I have a right to demand payment for their experience?</i>
<p>
Yes, you absolutely do. Put up a fence and charge admission to your garden....

You missed the point of my analogy.
<p>
making a copy : code :: viewing from the sidewalk : lawn
<p>
In my lawn example, I want to extract some kind of payment from <i>the mere act of looking at the lawn</i>, even if the people looking don't touch my property.  I put effort into the lawn, the viewers are deriving value (enjoyment) from my work, and therefore I deserve compensation from them.
<p>
Likewise, you want the legal right to extract copyright-royalties from <i>the mere act of copying your software</i>, even if the act of copying consumes no physical resources that you own.  You wouldn't be satisfied with some kind of copy-protection technology, (analogous to an opaque fence around the lawn), without any legal recourse against the people who evade the technology (analogous to people who view my fenced lawn from a plane flying above it).
