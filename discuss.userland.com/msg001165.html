The problem isn't that COM servers are invisible. Frontier as a COM server isn't invisible when called from another application. But IIS runs with its own invisible desktop. COM servers called from IIS are invisible.<p>

I've been looking at the archives of the ISAPI list:<p>

<a href="http://listserv.15seconds.com/archives/isapi.html">http://listserv.15seconds.com/archives/isapi.html</a><p>

One message mentions the possibility of running IIS as an application rather than a service:<p>

<a href="http://listserv.15seconds.com/scripts/wa-15seconds.exe?A2=ind9703D&L=ISAPI&P=R1171">http://listserv.15seconds.com/scripts/wa-15seconds.exe?A2=ind9703D&L=ISAPI&P=R1171</a><p>

But I can't figure out how to do that -- launching inetinfo.exe manually seems to do nothing.
