What's proprietary?  The Java platform is still determined by one and only one company: Sun.  Sure, its promise is to run on lots of other platforms and architectures, but its destiny is still tied to the fortunes of a single company.<p>

What makes Sun's Java platform more "open" than Microsoft's?  In my view, they're both about equally open, just in different ways.  At least Microsoft doesn't force you to code in a single language.<p>
