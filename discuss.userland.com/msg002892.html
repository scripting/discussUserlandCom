This means regexps, though, yes? And XML hadn't ventured into
that territory, last I looked, so I'd expect the URL needs to
be embedded in an <a href= "http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/&gt;"

Not at all. With this kind of XML document, the data is all represented as a tree. So if one little branch of that tree is called "url", and it contains a URL, you can just say, 'go get me the contents of that branch and stick in in an HTML <A HREF="msg002892.html"&gt; tag.'<p>

(You COULD do it with a regexp, but that defeats the whole purpose of using XML)<p>
