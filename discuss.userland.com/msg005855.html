This is only the case if the platform is actually *ready* for evangelism. Which means working, shipping products, not
presentation slides, simulations, and demos on suped-up
hardware.<p>

Premature evangelism only burns everyone involved, because
the technology won't live up to the hype - or at least not
for a very, very long time. If it's not as cool as it was
supposed to be, people will be disillusioned and stop
caring.
