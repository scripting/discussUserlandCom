Every time Lieberman's faith came up in the 
pre-pick discussions I'd watched or read it was a negative,
not a positive. The impression I got was that there were
substantial chunks of voters, even among Gore's own
base who would be less inclined to vote for the ticket
with a Jewish VP. In other respects Lieberman is a very
good pick. He's a centrist, so he will help Gore appeal
to swing voters and he was the first Democrat to publicly 
criticize Clinton about Lewinsky, so he helps Gore distance
himself from the administration's scandals. <p>

I don't think Gore expects Lieberman's faith to sell his ticket. Instead, I think Gore wants his ticket to be sold because he 
made a risky, principled VP pick. Whether that is also slimy and manipulative is another story...
