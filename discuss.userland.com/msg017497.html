We're lucky that Microsoft left a gap of 22 days for us to play with. <p>

BTW there's probably a flaw to Microsoft's NGWS strategy, it revolves around the W in NGWS. According to Microsoft the W stands for "Windows". According to Rohit (and I agree) the W must stand for Web.</i><p>

Well, yeah. Microsoft is a corporation interested in making money (I sometimes wonder about Sun and Oracle, though they manage...). They're going to see their own products as the center of any strategy. I imagine Microsoft looks at the web, and sees something like this...
<ul>
 <li>the web's really big now, and probably will stay important for a long time</li>
 <li>a lot of the web runs on Unix servers</li>
 <li>most people do use our web browser, but we can't really push that advantage too hard or standards advocates and lawyers get angry</li>
 <li>there's a lot of internet stuff that's useful, but hard for programmers to do right now</li>
 <li>how do we make money here?</li>
</ul><p>

Obviously, Microsoft's not going to build tools for developing Unix software, which leaves them with a <a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$117">chicken and egg problem</a>. I expect NGWS is really pretty much a strategy for solving that problem, something like...
<ul>
 <li>Strongly promote an open protocol for running services over the web. Get a lot of big and small companies, even those open source nuts, to think that this is a good idea (which it is). That way new stuff can be built on Windows servers, and it can be integrated with existing Unix servers. <b>Translation: SOAP.</b></li>
 <li>Build tools that make it very easy to build web services that run on Windows 2000 servers. <b>Translation: Visual Studio 7.</b></li>
 <li>To show that this stuff works, make a lot of Microsoft's existing web properties available through web services, some free, some at cost.</li>
</ul><p>

As far as Microsoft is considerned, Windows (and more specificly Windows 2000 Server) is at the center of this. That's the main thing that they're selling (well, and Studio 7 and SQL Server). As far as the rest of the Web is concerned, SOAP is the center.<p>
