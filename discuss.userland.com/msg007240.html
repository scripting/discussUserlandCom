Even under the name WBI.<p>

It's first incarnation was an OS/2 product, called WBI (webby) that plugged into your web browser (as a proxy server of course).<p>

It did a lot of handy things to assist you in your browsing, like iterate through the links on the page you were about to look at, ping each one to determine the latency of each external site, and display a green, yellow or red dot next to each link to let you know how slow the next page would be.... this was back when 14.4 and 28.8 modems were still fast and IBM Internet Services still used SLIP :-)<p>

Must have been 1995 or 1996.<p>

Then they released a Win32 version, I think in 97 or early 98.<p>

It's cool that now it's a toolkit anyone can work with.<p>

You can do a lot of cool things with this technology!<p>
