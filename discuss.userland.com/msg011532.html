For your information, I am one of the proponents of complete separation of form from content. I started syndicating Scripting News in XML almost two years ago, when no one was doing it. I run My.UserLand.Com which is an aggregator for this kind of content. I also develop a content management system for people who do websites, again, with the key idea being the separation of form from content.<p>

You'll learn more by listening than by making sweeping comments that lump people you clearly don't know with people you clearly don't like.<p>

If any Third Voice users are tuned in, check out Rogers' home page. See the little boy? Want to have sex with him?<p>

I wonder if Rogers would object to your comments on his site? After all, he doesn't own the presentation.
