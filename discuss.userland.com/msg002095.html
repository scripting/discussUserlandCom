I can understand this to keep the idiots out, but some form of limited individual membership that costs say 500 $US - 1000 $US a year would be nice.</i><p>

---><i>A real pity that joining is so expensive as I think that startups and dedicated industry professionals are where a lot of good ideas come from, mainly because they have current, real life coal face experince to draw on and forge concepts and ideas with.

Hey, this sounds like a good idea for a new organization.<p>

Membership would consist of small(?) companies and organizations, each of which pays a small fee to join. They could work together to hammer out cooperative projects and protocols, like XML-RPC and WDDX. Everybody gets an equal say, and no organization gets more than one vote.<p>

Shucks, I know I'd join (as Macrobyte Resources).<p>

Would be a chance to make (at least a small part of) the net "democratic", rather than what it seems to have become lately (ruled by a few forces: the browser vendors and W3C).<p>

Hmm.<p>
