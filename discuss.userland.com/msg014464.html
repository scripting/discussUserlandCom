You know, those little icons that has a smilie button for :-), and a little envelope for mail-to links.<p>

Was I dreaming? Are those still in Frontier, or do I need a pointer to the original site to download them again. I know, but I searched under all the terms I could think of, and didn't find any reference to them.<p>

TIA...
