How do you see this as redirecting traffic from the content producers?  It would seem quite the opposite to me since SalonHerringWiredFool.com directly links to each content provider's site.  A user clicks a story and is brought to their site, exposing them to that site's advertising, other content, etc...<p>

Any internet company that "gets it" will be tickled pink to see this site.  The key here, is whether they "get it".
