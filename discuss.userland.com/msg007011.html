I've been trying to work with them to accomplish the encapsulation of related data.  The problem is, the way the work now, the Main Responder is not properly aware of them with leads to security issues.<p>

With a table:<p>

<pre>#renderTableWith "xxx"
item01/
	publicItemData01 [string]
	privateItemData02 [string]
</pre>
Main Responder will serve <a href="http://">http://</a>[path]/item01 properly rendered through the table renderer...but it will also serve up <a href="http://">http://</a>[path]/item01/privateItemData02 by rendering the string as bodytext.  I think it should return a 404 not found.<p>

I've mentioned this to Userland and on the lists, but haven't received any acknowledgement as to whether they agree this behavior should change or not.
