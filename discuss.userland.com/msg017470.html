However, since the mailing is usually a little delayed from what is available on the website, and, since if I have access to my email, I usually have access to the Web, anyway, I tried to unsubscribe.<p>

But, whenever I clicked on the UnSubscribe button in the emails, I got sent to the Scripting News home page without any indication that I was actually unsubscribed.  Since I continued to get emails, I figured that something was wrong.<p>

I took a look at the HTML for the button and hacked a small HTML file with just the <form>....</form> stuff in the body, loaded that with my brower, clicked on that button, and ended up in a page that said that I was unsubscribed.  So, something is funny with the button within the email.<p>

BTW, I was using Outlook Express on a Mac for all attempts to unsubscribe from the email itself.
