Maybe we should have a way to do it. Someday<p>

I thought about this a while ago. Why not integrate this into the preferences idea you have? A specifc ID can point to multiple email addresses for someone. When someone uses their email address, it points back to this ID, which in turn is the key throught the database ?!?<p>

We would then be able to share prefs accross domains wher you have different emamil addresses (eg. home and work !).<p>

Maybe a bit OT, but thought I'd mention it.<p>
