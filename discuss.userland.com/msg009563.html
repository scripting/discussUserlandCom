Just getting Mozilla to a solid release level would be worth some money. And when you consider the market capitalization of the companies that depend on the existence standards-based browser with a level playing field, $10 million, even $10 million per year, is the tiniest of drops in the bucket.<p>

One example, consider <a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=RHAT&d=t">Red Hat</a>, whose market cap, based on the current stock price is over $5 billion. The shareholders gave them that kind of value so they would do something useful with the money. What could be more useful, right now, than getting Mozilla working solidly?
