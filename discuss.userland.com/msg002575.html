Undoubtedly, at some point, by some means or another, we're going to have to deal with XML-RPC request or response packets that contain XML fragments whose designs are contributed by different organizations. To give just one thought, in some extended XML-RPC we might find the need to integrate a pass-by-value object reference that uses a serializtion format whose tags and structure are defined by some outside standard.<p>

I think that using XML Name Spaces is the right way to avoid this. Check out: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/</a><p>

What one would do is declare that all of the element tags whose semantics are defined as part of the XML-RPC specifcation are actually in some particular name space, say (I just made it up):
<pre><a href="http://w3.org/Schemas/xmlrpc/kw">http://w3.org/Schemas/xmlrpc/kw</a></pre><p>

An example invocation might then look like:<p>

<pre>
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall xmlns="http://w3.org/Schemas/xmlrpc/kw">
   <methodName>examples.getStateName</methodName>
   <params>
      <param>
         <value><i4>41</i4></value>
         </param>
      </params>
   </methodCall>
</pre><p>

Not a big text change, but a significant conceptual one, since now all the tags in use are globally unambiguous.
