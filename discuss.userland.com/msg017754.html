If you want to participate in that conversation in order to sell a product or service you must not insult us, belittle us, and etc.  Ms could have saved face hear by stating that their customers are right and they did wrong by them..and then they could have either offered a deal to the governemnt to make windows..not winNT open source..which by the way was hinted at by the Judge as a n agreable solution.  <p>

I think there is a lesson here for several other players getting to the fringe of Antitrust scrutiny, Namely AOL, Cisco, and several others; that is participate in the customer conversation..why?  Let me ask who thinks that Netsacpe was an indirect customer of Microsoft due to their porting the Netscape browser to windows?  Or let us take a look at how Apple released Final Cut Pro without trying to use monopoly tatics against Adobe..<p>

Although MS has done themselves in a bit..they did us a favor..How?  By showing us in future years what the failure to engage in the web conversation/customer conversation costs!<p>

The lesson has not hit MS yet..although their are signs in their stock that investors get it..Hopefully the Board is intelligent enough to realize that soem top level changes may have to take place in order for Microsoft to renew its committment to customers!
