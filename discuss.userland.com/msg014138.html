I finally got it to reproduce on my workstation. <p>

<b>Found it</b><p>

One of the channels didn't have a URL. How did this happen? I have no idea. <p>

There's only one. The channel was registered on 12/20/99. Basically registering new channels has been broken since then. <p>

I'm going to fix the errant channel and get it working, and then we should once again be able to register channels on My.UserLand.<p>

<b>Yup</b><p>

The <a href="http://aggregator.userland.com/register">Registration</a> page works once again.<p>

All is happy in UserLand.<p>
