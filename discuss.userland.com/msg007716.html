I'm gonna play devil's advocate here and question some of Dave's assumptions. <p>

First: Why is it so unusual to expect someone to use a different environment to read and to write? Do you use your television set to make television programs? Do you use a book to write books? <p>

I know that <B>I expect different things of my web browser and my text editor</B>. When I slap some markup tags around a word, I want my editor to show me the tags without applying them, and my browser to apply them without showing them. <B>These are different tasks, and I don't expect one program to be able to do both of them well.</B> <p>

What I do a lot is cut-and-paste between my browser's textareas and my text editing app (BBEdit). What would be really nice is something like the link Frontier has with BBEdit -- I'd like to be able to <B>hit a key combo to bring the content of the current textarea up in a BBEdit window</B>, edit it there with BBEdit's powerful tools (much better than anything I'd expect Microsoft to come up with), and then have that <B>window save back into the browser's text area</B>. <p>

What I'd like even better than that is for both apps to <B>support inter-application scripting</B> and (in the browser's case) <B>a powerful and consistent document object model</B> to a degree where I'd be able to cobble together something like what I described above without either the browser's programmers or BBEdit's programmers having thought of it ahead of time. If I could write a script that says the equivalent of <I>"Look at the page in the frontmost browser window and see if there's a textarea with the cursor in it; if so, get the text from that textarea..."</I> I'd have a pretty powerful tool.
