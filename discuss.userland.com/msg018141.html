I think that Jabber may help provide that common interface - hell, it's just XML. The fact that they offer a public interface which can interact with AIM and ICQ is a good sign. AOL can barely get their shit together enough to bridge these two and they own both! It's like Apple circa 1995...

Yes, it's silly. The way that Jabber bridges protocols, as I see it, is to have a "jabber user" on each network hooked up to the Jabber server, which in turn brokers messages. Which isn't an ideal solution, since sending IMs through the server compromises both security and many of the peer-to-peer facilities that each service offers. <a href="http://www.licq.org">Licq</a> -- a straightforward ICQ clone for Linux -- uses OpenSSL channels, but doesn't have the XML backend or the flexibility of Jabber.
