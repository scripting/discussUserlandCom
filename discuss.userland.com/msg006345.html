If you're going to be starting with Linux for the first time, I'd strongly recommend waiting for LinuxPPC Release 5.0.  (Disclaimer: I work for the company.)  We're going to have a great new installer, and very nice desktop environments for running in.  It'll also have Netscape Communicator, which is not in the Yellowdog distribution.<p>

For setup, it can be accomplished in an hour.  Contrary to what all of the documentation that's currently published says, I recommend making only two partitions:<p>

swap (30 megabytes)
root (the remainder of the free space)<p>

Doing so makes it easier up front, and can stave off future headaches.<p>

Cheers,<p>
