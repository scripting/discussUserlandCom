(Of course this would need to be done automatically ;-)  If the translated list were added as a channel then changes/additions would show up in <a href="http://my.userland.com">my.userland.com</a>.<p>

Those interested would be able to watch as new channels arrive without
the need for scanning the list.  <p>

I know I've seen the suggestion for making the service list a channel before but didn't see a good reason for it until now.<p>

I'm beginning to see some real possibilities here.<p>

Thanks Dave!<p>
