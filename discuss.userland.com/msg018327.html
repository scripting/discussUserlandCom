It's been absolutely wonderful in San Jose/Los Gatos all weekend; highs in the mid-70s, bright and sunny, and that's what it's like today.  <p>

Just making a point, not that it matters in the cosmic scheme of things (or even on the local scale).<p>

Have a great holiday, no matter what the weather where <b>you</b> are.<p>

Cheers...David
