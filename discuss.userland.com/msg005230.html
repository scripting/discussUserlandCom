OK, gotcha. I thought I was asking for less than David ;-)<p>

I thought was he was referring to was the entire my.userland.com code where a number of people could create their own page, I just wanted to be able to get a handful of channels and create just a single page for it. No multiple users picking their own channels, just me. Thought this would be much less complicated than recreating my.userland.com.<p>

I'll wait and see what your braintrust comes up with.<p>
