And more in common with current Teletext systems, which are indexed rather than hyperlinked. (Though there's a facility called Fastext on modern TVs which comes a little closer to the BT claim: it works by arbitrarily assigning links from each page to four coloured buttons on the handset. Still, it's not close to Tim B-L's invention.)<p>
