A few glitches. Our static server got a lot beefier. We're now running Linux on a Subhonker.

"Those who try to hunker down and keep tight control of their online content, he suggested, will fail.

"There is a variety of displays, for example whole bodies of which the skin has been removed to show the muscles etc., or everything but the arterial system or the nerves has been removed. Some of the objects combine several of these."<br><br><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$551">Doc reports</a> from a Montreal bathroom. "I had to go so bad there wasn't a rational neuron in my brain. So it was with infinite relief that I found a bathroom, grabbed a stall, and sat there, organizing the days ahead with my daytimer. Then I heard ... female voices." <i>Uh oh.</i><br><br><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$552">A joke</a> that women who date engineers would get.<br><br>SD Times: <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/cols/webwatch.htm">XML Integrates Webs and Databases</a>. "SOAP and Blocks both go about adding some depth to solving the problem of querying databases via the Web. They aren't really markup languages, but they leverage XML in interesting ways and define separate and incompatible architectures and protocols so that you can build more powerful Web-based applications. While they are similar in their intent, they are very different approaches."<br><br>Weblogs.Com: <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/zeldmanIcons">Choose your Icon</a>. "If you have a weblog site registered, you can choose an icon. We will use this icon to link to your site in features we're dreaming up now." People talk about programmerish features, well this is a webloggerish feature. If you don't run a weblog it might not make sense. There's a chance to play with a graphic language for changes in weblogspace. I've been rolling this out slowly, so there are already some good icons taken. It's a land-grab, and if it's successful, we'll get more visual images for our collective writing work. It can't possibly *not* be interesting.

The first time, nothing happened. Without even being aware of it, Pete banged the space bar harder, since he thought that the problem must be that the Mac did not register his tapping the space bar. Actually,  it did -- but it didn't care!"<br><br>Microsoft: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/biztalkserver/techpreview.htm">BizTalk Server 2000 Technical Preview</a> is available for download. <i>Registration required.</i><br><br>Here's what I want. A set of public interfaces deployed on a server that I can experiment with. I want to toe-dip. I want to be able to use their services without being on Windows. I don't have a spare server to install their preview server on. Many of the people I work with are on Unix and Mac. <br><br>Elliotte Rusty Harold asks a question I've heard a lot lately. Basically, just because SOAP and XML-RPC are open, how do we know that what MS builds on top of these protocols is open? The answer is we don't. And further, why should we care? If it isn't let's reject it. There's so much power outside of Microsoft, but it sits there doing nothing but complaining, at least if you read the Times and Newsweek. <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16077">I wrote about this</a> in response to a posting from Dan Dees. "What Microsoft is doing is cool for sure, but we're doing something even hotter." Microsoft would like us to focus all the attention on them, can't blame them for that. (Well maybe you could, but that's another story.) The people Levy and Markoff interviewed aren't working in this area, clearly. If they were, imho, they would be excited and enthusiastic, not pissy and whiny.<br><br>Yesterday I paid property taxes on my non-intellectual property. For the first time I made it a ceremony. I wrote the check outside and thanked my trees for going along with the little myth that I own them (and the land they're rooted in).
