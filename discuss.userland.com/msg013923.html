An NT box and a copy of Frontier, obviously. But how are you handling the DNS? With a Mac? Do I need to cobble some sort of XML-RPC to BIND system? And what else am I missing?<p>

I don't know that such a service fits in their business model, or even what that business model is given that you're giving away editthispage.com services free (although I assume that you'll start doing ads or something eventually), but it seems a reasonable proposition that every ISP have a box stuffed in a corner somewhere to do this stuff.
