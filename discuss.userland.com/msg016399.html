With other companies, I go ahead and say what I think, but many of them won't work with UserLand as a result. Sometimes it seems as if criticism brings Microsoft closer. This is one of their strengths. They aren't scared of criticism.<br><br>My philosophy, probably shared with Microsoft, it doesn't matter so much what people say about you -- it matters what you actually do. If I point out an opportunity or problem, and you act on it, it makes you stronger. Therefore, intelligent criticism is a good deal, a win-win. I like it because it gives me leverage on my intelligence. I can't do everything, and I know it. But I get pleasure from using good products, and I like the feeling I get when I helped make a product work better. I'd like to create a list of companies that agree with this, those are the companies I want to work with. <br><br>BTW, based on recent experience, I'd say that Cobalt Networks falls into this category. I'll give them more coverage when they come through on their promises, but let me say this, if they do, we'll have more interesting stuff about Cobalt and other Linux vendors here, starting early summer.<br><br><b>Now, more discussion of Conxion</b><br><br>10:55AM: I got a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$581">response</a> from Steve Martin at Conxion. <br><br><a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/04/18">Dan Gillmor</a>: "If Conxion is getting rid of a customer because of the customer's statements, that's not smart business for Conxion in the long run, even though it's legal."<br><br>More comments. First, we not only make the software that runs Dan's site, we also host it. So an ISP outage like the one with Conxion could have knocked Dan off the air too. Second, Conxion has never given us a reason for the termination. We've heard about their statements from reporters, which varies widely depending on who they're talking to and when, but their April 12 letter doesn't provide a reason, and there has been no response to the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$577">email</a> I sent or the postings here. Third, if it is, as they said to Dan, an issue of economics, why the abruptness? Why not a grace period for a long-term customer who has to make a forced transition? <br><br>Dan also says: "I'm working on a column discussing the power of ISPs relative to their customers." I suggest that Conxion empower someone to work out an amicable exit here, so we can say that Conxion, in the end, did the right thing. <br><br><a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/"><img src="http://legacystatic1.userland.com/snImages/danGillmorJournal.gif" width="107" height="66" hspace="10" vspace="0" border="0" align="right"></a>And finally, Dan says that I'm a friend. I agree! Friends don't run away from disconnects, they have the courage to go into them, and learn, and if it's done well, the friendship is stronger for it. Thank you Dan, I am very glad to be working with you, web person to web person. I care that you work for the SJ Merc, only sofar as some people, like Conxion, take you more seriously than they take me. I hope that in the future Scripting News will be as respected a name as the Merc, but at least with some people, we are not there yet.<br><br><b>I like to close with group hug stuff</b><br><br>Joshua Brauer: "Possibly the first "group hug" on the Internet was the <a href="http://www.brauer.org/oklahoma/">Oklahoma City Bombing Sympathy Card</a>. BTW it's a site that was made possible by Frontier, especially when the original ISP shut it down, Frontier made it easy to move it to my own server which I ran by that time.
