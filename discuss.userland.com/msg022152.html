I tell them that I like working with Microsoft, have had a relationship with them for 20 years, they're now a BigCo, and behave like one, we've had ups and downs, that unlike other BigCo's they tend not to hold grudges, and the Times didn't tell the real story. They go away. Conclusion, if there are any reporters trying to do balanced stories on Microsoft, they aren't calling me.<br><br>Actually I filed this bug report in <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/04/05/HailThis">April 1997</a>.

I use the word to distinguish between those who practice an art professionally (it's how they make their living) and people who do it without compensation. Olympic atheletes used to be amateurs. College basketball players are amateurs (although this is a much-discussed topic).<br><br>Tucker Goodrich: "Originally an amateur was someone who did something for love, rather than for money. The root is the Latin <i>amare,</i> 'to love'. How 'amateur' ever became a term of disparagement I can only guess: is must have been the professionals propagandizing against the amateurs, to improve the professional's fees."<br><br>A bigger picture. A friend's mother is dying of cancer. In her last days. Then his father dies. Mom is still at death's door. Reminder. Enjoy life now.<br><br>
