Moira Gunn: <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gunn/docs/gunn121399.htm">One digital day at a time</a>. "The entries for some days are short, while others are quite long. Now, think about it -- you would seldom see this in a newspaper. You pretty much write the column to match the space, but that's not so important on the Internet. He can write exactly how much or how little he wants to on any given day."<p>

Is HP's <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13639">e-speak</a> a rip-off of XML-RPC?<p>

MSNBC: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/344962.asp">Lycos searches for a sticky solution</a>.<p>

Josh Lucas put together a <a href="http://barista.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$9">recipe</a> for installing weblogMonitor.root. <i>Thanks!</i><p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$13630">Lawrence Lee</a> is working on something amazingly interesting, but I have no idea what it is!<p>

<a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.1.1/Zope_211_release">Zope 2.1.1</a> has been released.<p>

BTW, if Vignette were to post release notes publicly on the web I'd point to them too.<p>

This may the <a href="http://reiswebpage.editthispage.com/">youngest</a> Manila webmaster. Frontier is actually older than he is. <i>I love the web!</i><p>

<a href="http://marcsvoice.editthispage.com/">Marc's website</a> is like his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060987049/002-2101164-0445823">company</a>, totally 1.0. <p>

Looks like <a href="http://charliechecksitout.editthispage.com/">Charlie Wood</a> opted out. That's his right of course. It was a nice looking site. I wish Vignette had the guts to come out of hiding and do some marketing. <p>

Phil Greenspun's <a href="http://photo.net/wtr/vignette-old.html">old review</a> of Vignette is more fun than the newer one. "Vignette's StoryServer product does not do any of the things that their marketing literature claims it does."<p>

<a href="http://ondecidingbetter.editthispage.com/">James Vornov</a>: "What are the pure play investments for the Edit on the Web segment? Do you think Dave will let EditThisPage webloggers in on the Userland IPO?" <i>Ohh you betcha!</i><p>

Red Herring: <a href="http://www.herring.com/insider/1999/1214/vc-dfj.html?id=userland">A VC for the Masses</a>. "We want to allow the small investor a chance to participate in this important driver of the US economy."
