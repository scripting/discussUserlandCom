I was wondering about that. Could we offer a service to those sites? We would reformat their stories so they would be readable on a palmtop. With Regex it shouldn't be hard to come up with a "driver" for each big news website that converts their content to be palmtop-friendly. <p>

This may be a place where content management developers could shine, and where we can use a low-tech solution instead of doing something heavier and more expensive.<p>

But clearly it requires the consent and cooperation of the news sites. Copyright issues stop us from reformatting their content, although I'm sure many of them would want the reformatting to happen.<p>

If any sysops from News.com, or Infoworld, or Excite or the NY Times, are tuned in, what does your legal department say? Would you be willing to do a trial with us? It could lead somewhere interesting. The palmtop guys are doing doing what Microsoft and Netscape said they were going to do with "channels". It's really happening in palmland.
