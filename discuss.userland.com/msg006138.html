What I mean is that for instance it would be nice to have xml-rpc for Dreamweaver, but DW doesnt talk http. But it could scan an inbox for emails with some special header and perform somewhat delayed executions.<p>

My thought for this is imagine a client who wants to have revisions made to a website and perhaps uses some "wizard tool" that converts his revision marks somehow into xml-rpc. then that is sent to an email box where the designer resides.  The designer initiates a "scan" of some inbox and brings these revisions into some sort of que to work on.<p>

If I knew how to code in C I could probably get xml-rpc for DW myself since it has an open extensibility spec.
