For instance, it's illegal for me to take a phonebook, photocopy all the pages, and sell them. It's legal for me to scan in all the names and numbers, put them in a database, and allow people to search them. Or, for me to retypeset the information and print a different book.<p>

Now, clearly, the person assembling the phone numbers expends significant energies validating and cleaning up their data, but none of that is protected. Likewise, food recipes aren't copyrightable. Well, you can place a copyright on the exact recipe, but if I alter the amount of one ingredient by a smidgen, then that's okay.<p>

A significant issue here is that computers allow the harvesting and processing of information with significantly less burden and hassle than before and laws haven't necessarily updated to cope with this.
