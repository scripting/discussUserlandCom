I didn't notice that.  Maybe that follows from so many developers giving them so much attention.  (But in that case, credit for popularity seems a little tautological.)<p>

David Rothgery: <i>...but the people who popularize a new (good) idea and make it work reasonably well deserve more than a little credit.</i><p>

Yes, I like to see credits and debits handed out fairly. <joking&gt;I've been keeping a ledger of accounts for this purpose, and the current running total for Microsoft is, let's see...</joking&gt;<p>

David Rothgery: <i> Apple deserves a lot of credit for doing the same with GUIs.</i><p>

Maybe I'm consistent after all.  I give Apple little credit for that.  Or maybe I did once and later exhausted the balance in the good will account, or something.  The first Mac UI was quite admirable, though.<p>

Okay, okay, I should notice when I'm blundering into a popularity contest and stay out.  It always makes me want to clown and play pranks.
