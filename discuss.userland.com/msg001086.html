Actually it isn't a language, though- it's more like a standard set of flowchart-like elements, used for describing Object-Oriented relationships: inheritance, "one-to-" relationships, properties, methods, etc. I believe it's also used in database design, though I could be mistaken.

The idea, as I understand it, is that software designers work with programmers and clients to develop diagrams describing what needs to be accomplished. The software, like Rational Rose (<a href="http://www.rational.com/products/rose/index.jtmpl">http://www.rational.com/products/rose/index.jtmpl</a>) can often actually generate initial C   or Java code based on the models you develop, upon which you build the implementations.<p>

(Please- anyone who has a better understanding of this stuff pipe in and correct me if needed.)<p>
