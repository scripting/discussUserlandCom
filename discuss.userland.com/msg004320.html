Apple has said that future versions of Mac OS X Server will be based on the Mac OS X core that they've been working on.  This has the Carbon Toolbox-compatible API right alongside the Yellow Box so instead of rewriting your MacOS applications you can tweak them into running natively on the new system.  This is Apple's value proposition now.<p>

It's a good thing Apple finally gave up on their "rewrite your applications or else" line last year.  That was the worst message possible to send MacOS developers, and I think a lot are still smarting over it.  They were even talking that way about Copland!  Fortunately, that's no longer the message.
