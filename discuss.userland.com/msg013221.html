I'm in the process of coming up with an XML format for outlines, and I'd like to know about any prior work, so I can either interoperate, or have a good explanation as to why I can't.<p>

XML Exchange <<a href="http://www.xmlx.com/forum.html">http://www.xmlx.com/forum.html</a>> seems to be trying to do something like this, but I don't see anything on calendars.  A quick Google search on calendars also turned up nothing.
