And only if the request from Pike comes from that computer, should it work.  This may not be effective for load-balancing proxies which will use one of a number of outgoing addresses, but for most setups it should be OK.  (There could be a switch to turn it off.)<p>

In any case, I agree, the hash should be unique for each page, so a third party can't replay it to edit any page on the site.<p>
