This would be helpful in reading multi-page articles, or in computer based training sessions, where there usually is a "Next" button. Users would need to trust web designers to put the "Next" property in only when it is appropriate, though - not too great a chance that it would be used as it was intended.<p>

This reminds me of a browsing accelerator program that I tried a few months ago (only worked on MSIE4, and can't remember the name). It popped up a windows listing all the links on a page being viewed, and you could simply check which links you would like preloaded.<p>
