It's not the artists, who probably deserve to make most of the money, but <i>someone</i> is. So the recording companies have an incentive to find artists and promote their work. But if there isn't some way for <i>someone</i> to make money from music distributed via Napster, then not too many people are going to be involved with it.<p>

It's not enough to say that the current system sucks for artists. If it needs to be replaced, then any new system ought to protect artists intellectual property and provide a way for them to make money. And if a new system won't do that, then it's not better then what we've got.
