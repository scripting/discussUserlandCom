"The NITF is an XML-compliant markup language for news copy, press releases, wire services, newspapers, broadcasters, and Web-based news organizations. It was developed as a joint standard by news organizations and vendors worldwide, and it enjoys the full support of most of the world's major news agencies. As an industry-wide standard, NITF may be used by news organizations, software developers and others to create a common method–-a lingua franca–-for sharing and distributing files among traditional print publications systems, Web operations, archives and text resellers."<p>

(Bear in mind that "support" can mean "we think it's a great idea" without meaning "we're already using it.")<p>

NITF was developed over several years just in time to debut as a non-XML spec, then was quickly updated to use XML.<p>

See also the overal IPTC website (www.iptc.org/iptc) for further info including the NewsML spec:<p>

"NewsML is an XML encoding for news which is intended to be used for the creation, transfer and delivery of news. NewsML is media independent, and allows equally for the representation of the evening TV news and a simple textual story. Specifically, NewsML provides the following features:<p>

* All formats and media types recognised equally 
* Facilitates the development of news items 
* Collections of news items 
* Named relationships between newsitems 
* Structure consisting of parts and named relationships between parts 
* Alternative representations of the same part 
* Explicit inclusion, inclusion by reference and exclusion of parts and alternatives 
* Attachment of metadata from standard and non-standard schemes"<p>
