Welcome to Day 2 at WWW9. Still jetlagged, still psyched to be here. Sweet dreams to those back home, it's the start of a new day in Europe!<br><br>
Joel Spolsky's "Ben and Jerry's" <a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$113">column</a> is getting quite a bit of circulation including a <a href="http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?mss:4741:mdfggjopmgfkipfllphk">response</a> from a Netscapee. "It's quite possible that what remains of Netscape may actually have more internal consensus on values now than it did in its go-go years."<br><br>

It takes a lot of ingenuity, and a lot of hard work, and no one is going to be able to get away with anything less."<br><br>
Frontier: <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$4117">Changes in Nightly Updates</a>. "In Frontier 6.1, nightly root updates ran as part of the scheduler's overnight task. This became a problem, as the overnight task on most machines is set to run at 11PM or midnight. This meant that the server would get hit with lots of requests on the hour, but would handle very few requests in between."<br><br>

	<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$17332">Paul Sniveley</a>: "For God's good sake! Anyone running a publicly-available service as root deserves what they get."<br><br>
