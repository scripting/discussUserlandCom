I've been reading your teasers regarding Pike.  I gather that this is the code name of the next version of Frontier.  I thought I would let you know that Pike is already the name of a scripting language.  The Pike language is primarily used in conjuction with the Roxen Challenger web server.  Their website is <a href="http://www.pike-community.org/">http://www.pike-community.org/</a><p>

I don't really see anything controversial, but I thought I would let you know.  I think there might be some rumbling if the official name of the product is Pike.<p>

Jeffrey
