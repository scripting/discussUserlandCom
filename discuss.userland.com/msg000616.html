browser that i wrote up a year ago
out of frustration with IE and Nav.<p>

1. Allow the leading (the space between
lines of text) to be adjusted to make the
text more readable.  The most important
thing for readability is not the font size
but rather the space between the lines.<p>


2. Eliminate all flashing as pages are drawn.<p>


3. Implement non-flashing smooth scrolling.
Does anyone remember using ascii terminals
with smooth scrolling?  can be very nice.<p>


4. It would be super cool to extend the applet
tag to support a default color or image to be 
displayed while the applet loads.<p>

  <applet code="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/J3d.class" width=480 height=320 bgcolor="#ffffff"><p>

Maybe this should be an option to the embed tag if
it isn't aleady.<p>


5. If the new page has all the HTML and images
already in cache, it would be super sweet to 
render the image off screen and copy to the screen. 
That way the new page would instantly change with 
minimal distration. Then people could make content
that looks and works alot more like interactive CDROMs.<p>


6. It might be cool to add a "preload" tag, although
this could be abused.<p>

    <preload src="page2.html">
    <preload src="page2pic.gif"><p>

This tag would load the specified files into
the cache while the person is reading the current page.
Webtv uses the <link> tag to do this.<p>


7. How about making the browser so that you can
put all the controls at the top in a "slide away"
mode where they slide of the top of the screen
when you more the mouse away.  That way you could
read the document content with no distraction or
waste of screen space, but still have the
convenence of the tools....  use time in the
the user interface.<p>


8. The scroll bar on the right could also
be put into a slide away mode.  so it is only
drawn when you move the cursor over there.<p>


9. Add support for a "gamma" tag.  This would
insure that color images and RGB colors at least
looked pertty similar cross platform.  The
gamma tag could appear here:<p>

    <body gamma="1.7"><p>

or per image as well:<p>

    <img  src="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/in.gif" gamma="1.7"><p>

Gamma would apply to RGB colors also.  An even
better thing would be to implement support for
quantitative color specs with white point,
chromaticities, etc.<p>


10. What's happening with displaying equations?
Are you implementing the HTML spec (I think
there is one).<p>


11. As much as possible make documents appear
pixel identical across different platforms.<p>


12. implement all the user interface of
the browser using HTML or XML.<p>

13. Allow the browser windoe to be split 
into multiple columns and display HTML documents
in multi column mode.  REading test is alot easier
with shorter lines.
