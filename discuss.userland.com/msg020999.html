It is our intention for this product to be commercial. I was very pleased to see Chuck's product, that's in a similar space, is commercial from the start. We're going to bring money back into the software equation, now that the IPO frenzy has settled down, and there's a good conversation going back and forth between commercial and open source development. <p>

I'm interested in hearing people's thoughts, but we have a lot more building to do before we bring the money in. UserLand is doing well with Frontier licensing, our pockets are deep enough to sustain more investment, so that's what we're going to do for a few more months at least.
