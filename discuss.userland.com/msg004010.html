So I made a little web search and I was very surprise not to found a map in these web sites:<p>

Woodside Town web site<p>

<a href="http://www.ci.woodside.ca.us/">http://www.ci.woodside.ca.us/</a><p>

San Mateo County<p>

<a href="http://www.co.sanmateo.ca.us/">http://www.co.sanmateo.ca.us/</a><p>

Government of California<p>

<a href="http://www.ca.gov/">http://www.ca.gov/</a><p>

So I went looking here:<p>

<a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/Map_collection.html">http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/Map_collection.html</a><p>

And then found this map:<p>

<a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/world_cities/San_Francisco.jpg">http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/world_cities/San_Francisco.jpg</a><p>

Anybody have a more precise map of the San Mateo County to point to ?<p>

We heard a lot about Woodside around here, so I'm a little bit curious.
