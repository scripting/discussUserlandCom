From the discussion I could gather these answers:<p>

<ol><p>

<li>UserTalk interpreter/Frontier daemon for UNIX? No way! - Because Userland will not waste time and money on this (but they have esoteric plans, which may turn out not that esoteric one day!).<p>

<li>If you want to edit with Frontier and serve dynamically from a UNIX host, you can only use scripts, which can be interpreted by the UNIX server. You will not be able to use the object oriented HTML stuff and the 3rd-party suites itself (as long as they are used for the dynamic "per-request" parts)<p>

<li>You can do lots of direct interplatform stuff by calling scripts on the UNIX host directly via XML-RPC (whatever you need it for). There are bidirectional XML-RPC "gateways" available for Perl, Java and Phyton.<p>

<li>Theoretically, there could be some sort of back-ending of Frontier, when using a database (like MySQL) to reconstruct parts of the ODB concept there... but until now no one came up with a good solution for this yet (Is that what Dave calls "Frontier freindly runtime enviroment"?).<p>

<li>If that doesn't fit your needs, get an NT or MacOS server or stop digging!<p>

</ol><p>

p.s.: I like the idea of a JAVA frontend Dino Morelli was mentioning, but I think the latest stuff with IE5/DHTML (about which Dave is very enthusiastic), will make this option obsolete.</li></li></li></li></li>
