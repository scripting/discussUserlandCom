The important part isn't 3rd voice, isn't public annotation.<p>

I imagine that eventually 3rd voice will be just a particularly large pool of annotations, with their software well known and imitated.  ...Like with AOL and Chat.  AOL's value is that they are a particularly large pool of chatters - nobody goes to AOL for technology.<p>

If AOL put restrictions on chat that affected the true value (like "no pickups" :) then their users would just go elsewhere.  Same with 3rd voice and their user agreement.  The point of the user agreement is to protect 3rd Voice legally - enforcement is hopeless.
