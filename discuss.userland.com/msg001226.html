The lies (not under oath) are reasons to vote against him (as about 38 percent consistently have) and are reasons to urge him to resign.  The Constitution, however, requires "Treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors".  That word "other" is the problem.  His conduct, though repugnant, isn't like treason or bribery.
