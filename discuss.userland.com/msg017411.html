I'm trying to create a search engine in PHP/MySQL, that can talk with a Manila server via XML-RPC. It seems that the indexing messaging interface is pretty well defined, but I can't find anything on the query interface. What message does Manila send when the user is searching for something? What should the search engine send back? Are there any other messages that should be implemented?<p>

By the way, the searchEngineInterface link listed above doesn't work.
