This format can probably get better compression than typical general-purpose compressors like deflate because it knows the rules of XML (for example, whitespace is not significant in most cases). It is also similar to Frontier's pack() verb or Java's serialization facilities: it takes a graph of objects (a DOM tree) and converts it into a contiguous array of bytes.<p>

It makes sense to see this coming from the WAP forum; cellular phones have very limited bandwidth which would necessitate some form of compression.
