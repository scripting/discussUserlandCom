I want to simply strip the images out of some sites.  Something that just nukes the IMG tags.  Because my wife and I go to a lot fo movies, I've set up subscriptions to the pages that tell me what movies are playing at our favorite theatres.  Stick the machine in the dock, hot-sync, and I'm fine for spur of the moment trips to the theatre.  But the images in the pages make the downloaded information ugly.<p>

Perhaps as just a start, you could try filtering out the IMG tags on the sites you point to.<p>

Personally, I'm hoping for a Palm version of DaveNet.<p>
