<li>The version info is a no-brainer, I'll come up with a proposal for that when I finish reading your posting and Bob's. <p>

<li>Modularizing the spec might be a good idea. I just wonder if we really need all those choices. I understand that you're designing for your user base. If XML-RPC becomes a two-dimensional array, where will there be compatibility? Specs have to make choices, right?<p>

<li>Give me a scenario for embedding a RPC request in HTML? Do people want to use a wizzy HTML editor to write RPCs? Does this somehow relate to Cold Fusion? When does the RPC run, when the user clicks on a Submit button?<p>

<li>Re encoding the call in a URL, I think those URLs are super-ugly. They're disappearing, thankfully. I would not like to do anything to promote the idea. 
</ol><p>

About doing all that before we talk about integrating WDDX, please, why make us jump thru all those hoops? Getting WDDX into XML-RPC is really a matter of allowing a WDDX packet to be a param type for a XML-RPC call. If we had a customer who needed this, we could do it in a week of coding. I don't think there's any design traps in there. <p>

But after reading the other postings I may come back here and change my mind! Let's see what happens.</li></li></li></li>
