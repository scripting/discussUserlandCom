Actually the issue is a little more complex than character sets.  XML only allows for about 5 HTML entities, so anything else chokes, at least in IE5.  An example would be &amp;copy; <a href="http://www.wc.cc.va.us/services/news/today.asp">which is an issue with my use of RSS files</a> (the channels designated by numbers have problems), but any entity is an issue.  The alternative is to change the encoding, but RSS providers frequently make the mistake of using HTML character entities with a standard encoding (and they think RDF will be easy?).<p>
