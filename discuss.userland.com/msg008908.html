I have now released the first version of "MacTidy", a standalone version of Tidy for Mac OS with a graphical user interface, which replaces earlier command-line interface versions, and is less buggy than current "TidyHTML" filter versions.<p>

This is a beta release. It has proved quite stable in my testing, but is feature incomplete - I have various enhancements in mind, but I welcome your feedback.<p>

You can obtain the software from my web site :<p>
