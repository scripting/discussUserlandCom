Dave, <i>of course</i> other markets have disappeared for other reasons. I certainly never said that every time a market segment was devastated it was due to the GPL. But in the case of compilers, it was -- and the compiler vendors will tell you so.

P.S. -- By the way, I hate to beat on the same drum again, but it's important -- the GPL isn't open source. It does not conform to the Open Source Definition, and plainly isn't open to developers. Licenses which do conform to that definition are not as harmful.
