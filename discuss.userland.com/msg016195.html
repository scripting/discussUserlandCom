That's what you call holding back? In short, you mail bombed their CEO, criticized their service loudly in a public forum, and made a lame threat to cut their own lines with scissors. And as best as I can figure, you did all of that due to a problem with PacBell's service!<p>

Would they do this to Dan Gilmore? Of course not. Not because he's Dan, but because he wouldn't have pulled the kind of shit that you did.<p>

Act like a businessman. Or a journalist. Stop whining like a spoiled child.
