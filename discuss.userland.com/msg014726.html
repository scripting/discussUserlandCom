I have been following your site for a several years.  I tried "Clay Basket" and "MacBird" and Frontier 5.  <p>

Manila has great potential for schools. I have been trying to get teachers to create and maintain web sites since early 1995.  A few of our teachers regularly maintain their sites, but for the majority it is still too much hassle or they don't understand the file structure.<p>

Thanks for allowing people to experience the editthispage technology of Manila. I immediately signed up a couple of sites, played around, and being busy trying to keep things running at school, haven't updated them since.  However, when you opened new sites up to anyone, I showed  students in one of my computer classes how to sign up, and asked them to experiment.<p>

The results have been impressive, and I now have several really good sites to show others in the district the potential of this technology.  I am getting requests for things that shout "Manila" as a solution.  One of our departments wants a discussion area, we publish a daily bulletin on the web the old fashioned way-a new page created and posted every day.<p>

We will be ordering a copy of Frontier so that we can run it locally. Nothing sells or teaches as well as a really great demo.<p>
