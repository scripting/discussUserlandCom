I've got a DG (discussion group) that has 13,000 messages in it.  I've noticed recently that as people are knocking around reading messages, Frontier chews up about 30 megs of RAM.  If I close discuss.root, the memory comes back.<p>

Dave, I'm not sure if your proposal would address this issue or not.  I'm ignorant in this area.<p>

Perhaps I need to setup a routine like the one that closes the daily log every hour?  I suspect that Userland and I are one of the few folks that have 10k+ messages in a DG.  Are there any other heavy hitters out there that want to identify themselves?<p>

Perhaps we could start a 10k plus club?  :-)
