And to end it with a grand slam single just seems appropriate.<p>

I remember thinking several times during the game, "Man, if the Mets win this, Bobby Valentine is a genius, but if they lose, he's an idiot." :^) But the game just kept going and going.<p>

Then the Braves scored in the top of the 15th. Oh well. I still thought Valentine out-managed Cox. The Braves were just better when it got down to the wire.<p>

Then the Mets exploded out of nowhere, culminating in a grand-slam, one-run single.<p>

Wow. "Amazin'" is the only word.
