It isn't their concern now, but it probably was one of their concerns
when they were first starting.  If you're in startup mode, keeping your burn rate low, not sure when the money runs out, and planning to
scale up to match user demand, low incremental costs for servers is
definitely a killer attribute.<p>

And, experience shows, once you've picked a server, you probably
will stay with it until something breaks.
