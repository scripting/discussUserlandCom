The one that comes most readily to mind is several years ago AOL installed a mail filter which blocked any e-mail containing the word breast.  It turns out several breast cancer orginizations were using AOL and now found many of their e-mail messages blocked, talk about your unintended consiquences.<p>

Now comes a <a href="http://www.ragingbull.com/mboard/boards.cgi?board=AAPL&read=37601">report that AOL is censoring stock discussion groups</a> which make any negative references to AOL or Microsoft.  I have no verification of this as I haven't used AOL in about 5 years but it sounds like their modus operendi.<p>
