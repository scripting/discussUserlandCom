There is a major difference in kind between software of the sort that runs on computers and software of the sort that exists between the covers of a book or magazine. A copy of the first sort of software must exist on your computer for you to take advantage of it (although that's changing, with the advent of more and more thoughtful web-based applications). To take advantage of books and magazines, however, it's not necessary to have them in your home for any longer than it takes to read them, and libraries are happy to lend them to you for that length of time.
