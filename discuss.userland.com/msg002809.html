I don't have time to learn how it works. However, we have an <a href="http://www.scripting.com/mostRecentNews.xml">always-current XML version</a> of the last day of Scripting News, and would be happy to support Netscape and others in writing syndicators of that content flow. No royalty necessary. It would be easy to have a search engine feed off this flow of links and comments. There are starting to be a bunch of weblogs, wouldn't it be interesting if we could agree on an XML format between us?<p><p>Netscape: <a href="http://people.netscape.com/sspitzer/channels.html">Unofficial NetCenter Channels</a>.<p><p>Tonight in Mountain View: <a href="http://www.employees.org/~ghoward/svjug/">XML and Java</a>.<p><p><a href="http://www.mailtothefuture.com/">Mail To The Future</a> is mature. Go ahead and point to it. Here's the tag-line: "Send mail to yourself or others at a specified date and time.. <i>in the future!"</i> (Note the italics. Take a deep breath. <i>In the future!</i>)<p><p>Where we're going from here.. MTTF already has XML and XML-RPC <a href="http://www.mailtothefuture.com/public/techInfo">interfaces</a>, and we're adding <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$2757">new wires</a> on a daily basis. This is potentially quite revolutionary. Cameron Barrett wants to use it to distribute a news letter to a list of readers. We need a Support-Associate to work with him (<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$2772">I'll guide</a>). Marc Canter and his team are making excellent progress on a DHTML broadband interface for MTTF. And MTTF is not Mean Time To Failure as Anita Rowland thought. (So far so good!)<p><p><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$2804">How do WebDAV</a>, the Discussion Group and DHTML design tools fit together?<p><p>PandaWave: <a href="http://www.pandawave.com/uuidlib/">UUIDLib for Mac</a>. WebDAV uses UUIDs. They're distributed source on this, so it should be possible to get this code, or equivalent, running in Frontier.<p><p>Wired IPO prospectus excerpts: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/ipo/vignette/">Vignette</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/ipo/netobjects/">NetObjects</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/ipo/razor/">RazorFish</a>.<p><p><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$2805">Jason Gerry found</a> an interesting application for MTTF.<p><p><a href="http://buzz.builder.com/cgi-bin/WebX?13@@.ee78a63">Builder Buzz on</a> Microsoft Visual Interdev 6.0.<p><p>ConservativeNet: <a href="http://congress.nw.dc.us/conservativenet/elecmail.html">Write to Congress</a>.<p><p>
