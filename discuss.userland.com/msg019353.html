I would also like it to be such that if the sender de-selects the checkbox or represses the button, the name is taken off the list.  I have figured out how to place one name in the "To" box, but when I select more names, the previous name is replaced. <p>

I am not able to use the Address Book because I need the names and titles to be visible.  Not all the names have titles, and I don't have access to update them.<p>

I am unfamiliar with VB script, and so any help will be greatly appreciated!<p>

Thanks!
Nicole
