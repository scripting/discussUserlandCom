Basicly they are correcting the laziness or inattention of the original programmer.  Often by the time they DO fix these problems, the original author has based a whole new slew of features on the old buggy code, which then have to be fixed.  :-)  This results in OpenBSD using some fairly old software, though it is rock solid software.  <p>

Typically you can get 95% of the security in OpenBSD if you just do a minimal Linux install, then ONLY install the packages you need.  <p>

I personally would use OpenBSD for Network infrastructure, firewalls, routers, dialin servers, etc.  They are also doing good things with IPv6.  I think the BSDs will have a headstart in rock solid IPv6 implimentation because of OpenBSD's headstart on work in this area.
