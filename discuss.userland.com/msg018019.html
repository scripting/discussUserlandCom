Thank you - I laughed, and laughed. Its silly I know.<p>

a Steven Wright joke -<p>

"Had to buy phone, I didn't have enought money - so I had to buy an irregular phone, ... it has no number 7<p>

A couple months go by and I run into a friend of mine on the street, he says - <p>

'How come you never call me?!'<p>

'I can't call everyone I want to, my phone has no number 7'<p>

'Wierd, how long has been like this?'<p>

'Don't know, my calender has no number elevens.'<p>
