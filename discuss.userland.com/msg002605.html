Chuck, this is the part that's unclear to me. Where are the public domain word lists?<p>

Further, who is running <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/">Dictionary.com</a>? Their dictionary has gotten quite good. Is there some way to leverage off its existence? (Probably not, their <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/terms.html">license</a> is very restrictive.)<p>

I was thinking of having an XML-RPC server where people shoot text at us and we do the kind of stuff that the MSGSPELL guy did. To get something like this bootstrapped we need a server somewhere that we can shoot words at. This sounds like a fun project. (Yeah I need another one of those!)
