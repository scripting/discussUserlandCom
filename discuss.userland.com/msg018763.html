Annual follow-on subscriptions for that kind of use would be handled online.<p>

Besides the obvious, I'm thinking that this reasonably challenges experimenting hackers-power users to give it a serious shot; may conveniently support Napster-like desktop server experiments in the Userland community and, if Manila-template stuff is packaged appropriately, enable even non-power users to run their own (single) Frontier-served Manila site on their own desktop.<p>

Expanding the use of Pike will be nice too.<p>

It isn't too hard these days to put together a retail package fairly inexpensively and most of the documentation could still be handled as an online service.<p>

Maybe raise the price of the full version since most of those users are likely to be corporations and the like who ought to know they're getting a great deal, even at, say, $1299?<p>

Just some passing thoughts for possible discussion.<p>
