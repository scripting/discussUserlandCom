Larger question is right!  Heh.<p>

If I understand correctly, there is no real formalized structure to deal with binaries other than images then?<p>

Generally I can see two kinds of binaries.  Ones that could be included in a page.  Similarly to how images can be included in pages now.  The second would be linking to binaries such as sounds and PDFs.<p>

So maybe the thing for me to do is put out for folks to peruse, my binaryLink suite.<p>

<b>NOTE</b><p>

This is a very crude suite. Mainly because I hacked this suite together based on the imageRef and related routines to solve one specific problem I needed solved.<p>

Think of it as more of a starting point for discussion of how to handle binaries in websites more generally in Frontier 6 and beyond.<p>

Please, feel free to dig in and make suggestions.  I'll do my best to coordinate things.  I'm new too making suites so I don't know if I organized the various locations of stuff properly.<p>

When you load the suite, run the init script to set up.  Isn't there some way to auto init when you load a suite for the first time?<p>

Toodle-looooooooo........
