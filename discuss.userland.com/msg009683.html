My question is this: am I going to be able to purchase Frontier for Linux in the future, or will it be a stripped down kernel w/o an interface? I would like to buy 6, but I don't want to purchase it for NT if I know I can hang on for the Linux version.  <p>

Or, as a friend of mine keeps saying: "Just buy it. You know you're gonna do it... just buy it."  As much as this probably hurts UserLand to hear it, I'd rather just buy _one_ copy, not _two_, especially since its a dual-booting machine that they'd both live on...<p>

<EM>Edit...</EM><p>

I just realized that I was talking about two different editors simultaneously... Think under Linux, and Think under DOS... oy.  <p>

Sorry.
