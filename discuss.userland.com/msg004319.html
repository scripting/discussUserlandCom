It's a server platform, not a client platform.<p>

But with OS X client, which has Carbon, it won't take long for even the biggest of apps exiting Mac apps to be ported.<p>

Hell, Photoshop (or some big adobe app) was demoed a year ago (almost) running on OS X Server with Carbon libraries, and it took what, 3 weeks to port it?  And one of the VPs was involved in the porting, if i remember correctly.<p>

A: Photoshop isn't a $100 app.<p>

B: They can easily sell 50,000 copies of it.<p>

OS X Server is a server OS.  It's not OS X, or even close.<p>

People should withhold judgement until they at least SEE the OS X client.<p>

I'm sure anyone would appreciate the same respect and courtesy when they had a product under development.
