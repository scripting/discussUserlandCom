Is there an elegant way of doing so? (maybe prefs, but just for this one root without changing it for all of frontier)
Right now we got along with a page filter , but it is hard work to get all the possible tags filtered.<p>

ps: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$14915">hearing Dave talking about beeing "european"(early up in the morning)</a> sounds funny. In fact , I as an european "Userlander" start working at "Userland-time". So if u ever decide to move to europe , dave , that would mean i have to get up much earlier.
