But in any case, the setup did go a lot more smoothly than an NT 4 Server installation.<p>

Consider the fact that bringing up an NT 4 Server for me means:
Install NT
Install SP3
Install IE 4
Install Option Pack (for IIS)
Install SP5
Install MDAC<p>

...with a reboot for each one.<p>

All that stuff just comes with NT5...er W2k.<p>

On the other hand, the new UI is rather frustrating as mentioned above. Options seem to be split up more, and the whole UI seems to be more 'in your face'. More buttons and roll-overs and bevels etc etc.
