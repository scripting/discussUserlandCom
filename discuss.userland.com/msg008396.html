I went into the calendar for one of my discussion groups and removed the entire previous months table.  I then went to the web page, reloaded, and indeed the previous month became unlinked.  Not sure what the fix is, although if I come up with anything, I'll probably post it here.  Assuming Userland doesn't come up with something first! :-)
