The manifesto's basic points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since intranets make it easy for a company's employees to communicate across departmental boundaries, a lot of internal corporate bureaucracy has become irrelevant.</li>
<li>Since the Internet makes it easy for a company's customers (and potential customers) to communicate directly with the employees who know what's going on, a lot of the standard corporate public-relations apparatus has become irrelevant.</li>
<li>Corporations that use the above irrelevant tools to stifle communication (internal and external) will lose to the competitors who know how to stand back and let the network help them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, these three points are wrapped in a lot of overwritten rhetoric, but I thought they might be valid points.</p>
<p>Then I read Dave's "too many editors" complaint, and I started wondering: how much networking is <i>too</i> much?  If the people who develop a popular software package (or some other product) are expected to read and respond to what the customers are saying, or if the people who work for a large organization are expected to keep in touch with others in diverse work groups, at a certain point, the overhead of communication would keep people from doing actual work.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
