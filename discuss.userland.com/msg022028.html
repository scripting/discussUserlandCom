I remember staring at it for a long time and really missing my mom. We did have Christmas presents that year, though. She was afraid she wasn't going to live until Christmas, so she made my dad take her out shopping in October. She didn't want to ruin Christmas for us."<br><br>Confirmation came that I am speaking at O'Reilly's P2P <a href="https://www.reg2.meetingsplus.com/oreillyp2p/main.taf">conference</a> about The Two-Way-Web on Wed, 2/14/01 at 1:15PM. Good time slot. One-half-hour. Thanks to the O'Reilly folks for letting me participate. I'm going to talk about what's hot in P2P and TTWW. I'll start a new site in a few days. It's time to get this stuff organized. <br><br><a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/myotdTeaser.gif">Teaser screen shot</a>. It'll probably be under the Christmas Tree shortly after Christmas Day. (It's a Web app that runs on your desktop. You get the source code, of course.)<br><br><a href="http://2020hindsight.editthispage.com/2000/12/22">Susan Kitchens provides</a> the kind of first-time user feedback that we need. "Radio displays the links as underscores. But I haven't yet figured out how to access the URLs." Yes, that's something we need to call out on the <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/howToUseTheOutliner">outliner page</a>. To see the HTML behind the links choose the Format Text command in the HTML menu. It toggles. <br><br>Also, Susan check out the <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/howToUseRadioWithManila#rules">Rules docs</a>, for now you have to understand them to get the text to format according to the structure of the outline. We have an enhancement planned that allows the Manila site to specify default rules. Then the question will be "How do I change the way this works?"<br><br>My seventh grade science teacher, Mrs. Lenz, used to talk about "investigation" -- that was her philosophy. What an important seed to plant in the head of a thirteen-year-old. Investigate. Good idea!<br><br><a href="http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33711-2000Dec20.html">Washington Post</a>: "The Internet is proving to be a difficult place to make a profit."<br><br><a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=saln&d=t"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/salonStockGraphDec2000.gif" height="96" width="192" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></a><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/12/21/BU157977.DTL">SF Chronicle</a>: "Salon relies on advertising for 87 percent of its revenue. Half of its advertisers are dot-com companies, and that is a shrinking market, O'Donnell said."<br><br>Salon wins awards, has record flow, while they hack themselves to bits trying to get profitable. Is there something more creative they can do with the $6 million than continue to bet on the idea that you can run a Web news magazine, even a great one, the normal print-inspired way? <br><br>
