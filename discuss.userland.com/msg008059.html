Its called <A href=http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1002>Just Wondering...</A>, I really think we're doing something really new here that will change the web again pretty soon.<p>

A few comments about my.userland and the new Weblog Editor:<p>

Today when I went to update my channel I had to erase all the content from yesterday, It would be way cool to have each day archived and in the next day only th new content showing up (or even better would be to be able to set the frequency the channel got archived in that way people could have daily, weekly or any timing on their welogs).<p>

As for my.userland I miss links on the menu to the DG and to SN.<p>

Greetings,<BR>
