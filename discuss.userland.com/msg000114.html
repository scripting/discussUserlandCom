the problem is the type is nearly the same length as the type on the previous page. People will assume they have already read it. Its a design-thing. Visual people use these clues to decide what to read. Verbal people are different, they notice the text is different, and they read it.<p>

Also the 'First Disscussion Group' is dominate over `check your mail'. Visual people will never read it.<p>

Sorry, just saw it as an obvious design-thing. Didn't mean to rant, or make refrence to yesterday (which i just realize someone might assume)<p>

Yea, I have a BS in Design & Art History.<p>
