Please do!<p>

And when you do, and my hits go up, I will send you a thank you note.<p>

However, if you take all the links off my home page, and my comments, and present them as yours, I will object.<p>

I have even objected when one of the weblogs in My.UserLand.Com was linking to all the stories I linked to, with light edits of my comments. I felt violated, like I was talking into a room with an ugly echo. What's on my home page is my creation, as Arnold says, a lot of creativity goes into it, a lot of personal expression. You can't have that, it belongs to me.<p>

Now you can churn it thru a search engine or an aggregation engine because I also produce an XMLization of it. But please don't make any changes along the way. (I have mixed feelings about the redirection that has been talked about here. On the one hand as an author I want the links to come right to my story. As a business person, I realize that the redirection is the way you make the cash register ring.)
