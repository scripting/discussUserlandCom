Look at WebDAV support in Office2000. You can read and save documents to folders on WebDAV-enabled servers. But can other apps take advantage of those capabilities? Nope. You want WebDAV support, you have to write it yourself. Something like that should be a well-documented API available to everyone.<p>

Maybe another provision should be that when MS claims to support a standard (WebDAV, XML, XSL, Kerberos, etc) that it must demonstrate 100% compliance with those standards. It can develop extensions to those standards, but only once they support the base standard fully, and then those extensions should be openly and completely documented as well.
