Even if it is http, you won't probably see it in your browser because it's served with a different mime type, but you can change you browser setting or open it with any text editor.<p>

<a href="http://wap.studioidea.it">http://wap.studioidea.it</a> only contains an image and a link. Hopefully soon we'll be serving a TOC for our sites with links to pages (been busy lately with a major update of our CMS).<p>
