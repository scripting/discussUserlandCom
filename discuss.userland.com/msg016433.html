In general terms I'm a sceptic, however for a distributed organization like ours (state community college system) it can make sense -- it's not unusual to travel 3-6 hours in a day for a 2-3 hour meeting.  With room-based systems (we've heavily invested in VTEL H.321 systems - full screen, high quality, two-way interactive video) we can also share enrollments in classes that wouldn't otherwise happen - try finding Japanese instructors in Southwest Virginia.  <p>

However, VTEL systems are expensive - $30,000+ per unit.  We're finding that the quality on the VCON room-based systems (about $8,000) is comparable with point-to-point connections (we haven't thoroughly tested multi-point connections yet), and we get T120 data-sharing as well.  We can also use it to hook into CISCO IP/TV which is full-screen, high quality video on demand.<p>

For about $800 I can get a VCON desktop product for my PCs, that with our bandwidth gives me high quality video with T120 data sharing.  We've got to watch our bandwidth and probably create VLANs with a bandwidth management solution - gatekeeper software update to our CISCO 3640 router is coming in a couple of months, but we can do that.<p>

So, I remain a sceptic, but I really think it's becoming more feasible and usable.<p>
