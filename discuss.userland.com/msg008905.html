I own a Sony Walkman TPS-L2, serial #215356.  Niether the picture nor the article in the NYT do it justice.  It is blue & natural aluminum, not plastic, and came in a nice blue leather case.  Also, contrary to the NYT article, the orange button enables a built-in microphone, sort of a karaoke feature. I purchased an extra pair of headphones and used the Walkman to replace the stereo that had recently been stolen out of my 2 seater Fiat X1/9.  I paid $200 for the Walkman and $50 for the second set of headphones at Foleys in Houston.  The sales clerk said they had just received them and I loved it at first sight/listen. It still works, but the headphones are long gone.
