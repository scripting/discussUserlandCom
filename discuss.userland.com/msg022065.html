At 1AM last night Robert Scoble called Steve Wozniak to tell him about his Manila blog. <a href="http://wozcam.woz.org/">Wozcam</a> picked up a picture of Steve using Robert's site. And of course Robert being the born-blogger that he is, put the pic on his <a href="http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/">site</a>. <br><br>Here's a new bit of data. Scoble has a <a href="http://63.192.218.207/scoble.jpg">webcam</a> too.<br><br>As we move towards Frontier 7, Brent is adding notes to the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/news/">Frontier News</a> site. <br><br><a href="http://www.scripting.com/mp3s/crazyFingers.mp3"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/sound.gif" height="11" width="10" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></a>Perhaps I should rename this site <i>Dead-Newbies.</i> I have so much to learn about the <a href="http://www.gratefuldead.com/">Grateful Dead</a>. I never had a copy of Blues for Allah, and therefore never had a copy of <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/gdead/agdl/crazy.html">Crazy Fingers</a>, which I just love. It must have gotten a little bit of radio play because it's familiar. It's tonight's song for sure. BTW, deadnewbies.com is <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$deadnewbies.com">available</a>. Did you ever see the movie <a href="http://movie.epinions.com/mvie_mu-1001944">Beetlejuice</a>? They have a book called something like Handbook for the Recently Deceased. That would be the Dead-Newbies of course.
