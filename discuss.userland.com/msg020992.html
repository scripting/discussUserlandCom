<p>It is an interesting situation that GNU's public project (Gnome) is largely LGPL, while Troll Tech's alternative is GPL.  As I understand it, the key difference between the two GNU licenses is that LGPL libraries can be linked to closed, commercial code.  GPL libraries can only be linked to open, GPL-compatible code.  I suspect that the Qt license choice was made because Troll Tech sells a commercial developer's license/library to complement their open source one.  That's fine, I'm not shooting for a value judgement.</p>
<p>I think it is interesting that the GNU libraries may appeal to commercial developers on a <b><i>pragmatic</i></b> level.</p>
