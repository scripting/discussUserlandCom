At first I was thinking a CC: box would be nice, but people would exploit that in negative ways.<p>

But if you could get an e-mail copy of a message you post, with an URL at the top to the discussion group, you could Forward it to whoever you want to send a copy to.<p>

Also, it would be very nice (especially in an editorial environment) if you got an e-mail (optionally) when someone responded to your message.  In a work environment, where editorial work is only part of my job, I wouldn't want to be glued to the BBS all day. ;-)<p>
