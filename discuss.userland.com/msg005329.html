Personally, I think that Frontier would be better served going to MacOS X than to Linux. On OS X it could plug directly into EOF and WebObjects and still retain it's value as a systemwide application scripting utility - something I don't see happening on Linux.</I><p>

Having WebObjects connect NATIVELY to Frontier (not through XML-RPC, I need a much faster connection) would be just HUGE for us.<p>

We're doing WO apps *right now*, and I miss the ODB.  An EOF adaptor for Frontier would be great!<p>

We do content sites in Frontier, and web-apps in WO.  The silence between the two is deafening.<p>

So many connections that could be made, so much synergy in the fundamental design pattern both use extensively (key paths).  They do different things, differently, but are strangely related.<p>

I guess that's why I like both so much :-)<p>
