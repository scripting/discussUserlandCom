In many ways it comes down to professionalism.

One day I read <a href='http://www.arsdigita.com/asj/professionalism'>Something by Phil Greenspun</a> that hovered around this issue, and he referred to professionalism in medicine, as Dave did in his recent piece. Living in a nest of doctors most of my life I well understood the comparison. 
<p>
During a discussion about this issue with one of these doctors I was pointed to some articles in the New England Journal of Medicine (<a href='http://www.nejm.com/content/1999/0341/0021/1612.asp'>here</a> and <a href='http://www.nejm.com/content/2000/0342/0017/1284.asp'>here</a>). I think articles like these should be required reading for software developers right now. 
<p>
I'd also like to hear what civil and aerospace engineers have to say on the topic. Can you patent a *method* of building bridges? Should you? What do you do if the company you works for wants you to?.
