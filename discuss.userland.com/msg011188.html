The topic isn't what reactions men have to these situations but what the experience of women is in these types of male dominated discourses.<br>
And frankly I think your comment goes a long way to proving Dori's points.</i><p>

Oh, I think that it was absolutely relevant. A number of people think that we've acheived the goal of gender neutrality. A comment like that one, contrasted with the reaction of both Lynn & myself, helps to show exactly how far off we really are.<p>

It's one of those cases where a man & a woman could do the exact same thing, and I strongly suspect that the perception of the audience would be dramatically different in each case.
