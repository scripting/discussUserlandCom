I like your answer very much. <p>

Actually I am not interested in any OS whatsoever. But I always have to deal with people who are! I want to get rid of those discussions.<p>

Especially when I have a image of what should be the output of my effort. So if I can, I always try to use tools, which work almost everywhere. That is not a question of religion (as you said, that this is against your religion), to me it is a question of what might define the way I have to go.<p>
