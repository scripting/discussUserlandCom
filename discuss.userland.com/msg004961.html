Almost off topic:
A very interesting website is <a href="http://webfx.eae.net/">WebFX</a>. Done by two DOM/DHTML-magicians named Emil A. Eklund and Erik Arvidsson. They have a very good understanding of how to turn your IE4/5 Browser into a user interface, which gives you an app-like user experience (you should give their <a href="http://webfx.eae.net/webboard/">WebFX Webboard</a> a try). I have never seen this before (although I knew Microsoft is turning their IE Browser into an UI-engine somehow).<p>

They have another treeview callled "Folder Navigation" explained in "X Browser Examples".<p>
