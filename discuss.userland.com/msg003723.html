Ooops! I lied. X does have regions. They're just different. X has XCreateRegion, XUnionRegion, XPointInRegion. But X can't have QuickDraw regions, which are patented.<p>

Still, I wonder if QuickDraw regions could be faked with X regions. Let me find my copy of Inside Macintosh and I'll tell you. This would be a fun hack!
