Huh? All four of these sites have excellent well-deserved substantial brand identities. They've all been around for years and years, and are pioneers in the net. Salon did a humble IPO, Herring just covers the IPOs, and Fool just took their first round of VC after many years of operating. You couldn't have picked a worse example to rant about vaccuous brands, these brands are notable for their substance.
