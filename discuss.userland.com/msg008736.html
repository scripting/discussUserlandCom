finally solidified in my own mind just what XML is all about.
Prior to this trip, I thought "yeah, but why (other than XML-RPC)".<p>

Well, since I didn't have a computer, I couldn't check my 
stocks quickly.  I thought, if I could get my portfolio in XML
format, I could reformat the data and send it to my pager.<p>

So here I am Monday morning trying to find a source of stock
quotes in XML format - Hey, I'm a newbie to XML, so maybe
I'm just completely off the mark and/or lost.<p>

How does one go about finding content in XML format?  Where do
you look?<p>

Thanks,<p>
