On a Usenet newsgroup, of course, you don't want to leave: it's the subject matter. But it's a public space that anyone can enter, from the enemy who likes exactly the opposite kinds of things you do, to the get-a-life troll, to the alt.syntax.tactical flamewar-lover.<p>

For websites, if you don't like what someone says, you just don't go there anymore.
