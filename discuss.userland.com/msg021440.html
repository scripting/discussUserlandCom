to become stronger, sometimes in a hostile way.</i><p>

Yes, either eat them or starve them.  Of the two,
eating is a better fortune for the victim.  In either
case, the marketplace context around the companies
sees a net decrease in operative memes.<p>

In business we pursue monoculturism much too strongly.
Memes get retired after preliminary sallies that show
nothing very conclusive.  It brings to mind a Monty
Python sketch about the black plague, where a victim
must say, "But I'm not dead yet!"<p>

Josh Allen: <i>Sometimes companies find symbiotic
relationships with other companies.</i><p>

Works for me.  More memes in collaboration.  Of
course this is sometimes merely oligarchy, with
companies acting as divisions of a larger organism.
This was the intended meaning of the term Wintel.<p>

Josh Allen: <i>Often the rotting of a dead company
provides nutrition (in the form of talent) to
other growing companies.</i><p>

Rotting and dead are usually forced metaphors here.
And this metaphor is a bit chancy, since we don't
eat our dead. :-)  We might find humor here.  When
your uncle Ralph is dying, is it okay if I claim
dibs on his spare parts when he's done with them?<p>

The whole view of companies as potential spare parts
is a mindset motivating the Borg metaphor, which
is exceptionally unpopular.  The images showing Bill
Gates as a Borg operative are not complimentary.<p>

Companies exist to make things, not just to give
folks a living salary.  When everyone works for the
same monoculture, less is created and we are deprived
of useful variety.  Though folks as spare parts
are not killed, a larger creative pattern still
dies when a company folds.<p>

When a rabbit eats a carrot, the carrot becomes a
rabbit and not the other way around.  This is what
I tell young folks who tell me they are considering
a job at Microsoft.  The US Army doesn't change when
you sign up, no matter how bright you are.<p>

A great many Stephen King stories are about eating
and being consumed, and one of his short stories
even explicitly discusses this theme.   It's strange
to see this staple of the horror genre used as a
justification for good company hostile practice. :-)<p>

Josh Allen: <i>Of the fortune 500 companies on the list
in 1970, 20% no longer exist in any form. All the same can
be said of animals. All of these we tolerate.</i><p>

Companies are not animals, and pursuing that metaphor
can hinder you as much as help you.  That we tolerate
things does not mean they are desirable.  In fact, much
progress occurs when we selectively stop tolerating
some things in our environments. <p>

I'm not talking about green earth stuff, about which I
don't care.  This is about something I care about much
more than that.  I'm concerned about human culture in
patterns (among others) of corporate structure.
