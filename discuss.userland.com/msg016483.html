It only handles MIME parts that are 1 level deep. If that's all it's supposed to do, then I guess it's ok.</i><p>

Yes, it does not handle nested parts, by design. Crawl, then walk.<p>

<i>Are you deliberately leaving in the first line with the number of octets returned? If so, I was wondering what functionality this served?</i><p>

Yes and none. I think you're right: since it's part of the client/host conversation, and not part of the message, it can be removed without compromising any data.
