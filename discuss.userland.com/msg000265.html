That actually becomes an advantage in this situation, it gives us a very nice screen to project HTML on, it's in back of all other Frontier windows. I bet this'll be a very nice effect. And you're also right that much the same effect can be had on the Mac thru the Apple Event interface, but I bet it would be even nicer if the HTML displayer, with hooks, were available to us inside the Frontier kernel.
