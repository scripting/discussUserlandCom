To improve performance, default preferences may be set to "Once per session" (IMO, an archaic setting that appears to depend on regular browser-crashes!).<p>

In addition to the critical browser preference, correct cache-control (HTTP 1.1 or later) and/or "Pragma: no-cache" directives, even though they don't guarantee fresh data, are even more important now that data frequently passes thru multiple levels of cacheing proxies on its way to your browser. Since every external document (script, etc) is generally loaded via http, each relies on accurate cache settings on the server end, the browser end, and every point in-between.<p>

This barely scratches the surface of cache-issues. A good basic cacheing tutorial can be found at <a href="http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/">http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/</a><p>
