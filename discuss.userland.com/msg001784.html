I thought of accessing Frontier through ODBC like MS SQL Server, Oracle, Jet Datasources, MS Access. That would open a whole suite of (legacy) office and workflow apps.<p>

Possible uses I can imagine:<br>
- Having a huge selection of clients (Word, Excel, VB, PowerBuilder made clients, MapInfo, etc.)
- Being able to represent the data as relational DB, Frontier ODB, XML
- XQL as future development<p>

Implementation would need:
- ODBC Driver
- Communication through TCP/IP
- Building at least ODBC Core or Level 1 compatibility (ODBC daemon in Frontier, parsing SQL-Queries, see: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1782">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1782</a>)<p>

This will be a major task. Maybe it would be better to go straight into XQL parsing.<p>
