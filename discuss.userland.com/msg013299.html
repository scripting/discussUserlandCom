To get an idea of the kinds of things we are saying, check out the slide show:<p>

Usually when I read a company press release I spot something the company missed about their own product. I'd like to write a substantial  press release, backed up by an informative website, so I'm interested in knowing what you think Manila is, and esp what it will be. <p>

What do you plan to do with Manila? What are its greatest strengths? Opportunities for improvement? <p>

Do you see Manila as groupware? A place to develop your personal ideas? A reason to launch a business? <p>

Is it a home product, education product, business product?<p>

If you're not a Manila user, but have been getting hit with hype about it, what's the single most confusing thing about Manila?<p>

To those who were perplexed and now are not, what fact did you learn that made the lightbulb go on?<p>

Send responses publicly or privately. I'll assume it's OK to quote you unless you say otherwise. If possible include a URL to your website. Title and organization.<p>

Thanks very much..<p>
