Is this really what happens? This seems like it would work with either Netscape or IE, thus not requiring a local proxy for Netscape.<p>

Perhaps what happens is:<p>

a) User fetches a page, which is intercepted by the plug in or proxy.<p>

b) A plug-in or local proxy server submits the fetched URL to ThirdVoice, which returns *just* the associated comment data. The TV user's machine simply asks 'what are the comments for this URL?'.<p>

c) The plug-in or local proxy concatenates the original HTML with the ThirdVoice data.<p>

d) The web browser receives the concatenated HTML, and displays it.<p>

In this scenario, ThirdVoice would *not* be modifying the web page. The modification would happen entirely on the user's machine.
