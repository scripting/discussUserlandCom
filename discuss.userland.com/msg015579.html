They also outline the process for challenging a patent by proving the existence of prior art (without going to court).  Sounds like a lot of the perceived "flaws" in the patent process are just ignorance of the patent process. I.E. there is a method to register an invention without claiming any rights to it: there fore it can be used by the public, and is proved "prior art."  As the authors point out, stuff like XML-RPC, which is supposed to be public domain, is thus assured of that status.
