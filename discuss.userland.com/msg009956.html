1.The ones out of stock<P>
2. university or small run books<P>
3. and maybe, for what is books about technology/software, books that continuesly evolve and change, so that there will be the 
"xx/xx/xxxx 19.40 GMT" edition printed on demand, and next day a new book with new or different contents, with internet as an ideal place where offer and request meet.<p>
