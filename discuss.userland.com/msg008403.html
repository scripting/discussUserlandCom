I use multiple computers, and I would like to synch my bookmarks between them. VBScript will let me access the filesystem (with a security warning through the FileSystem object), so it should be possible to get the bookmarks, upload them to the server, process them (i.e. sync with a previous copy in Frontier) and then download them again.<p>

Does anyone know a site that does this? I'd like to get some example code to start with.<p>

A related question: where can I find the spec for the ".url" fileformat that IE/Win uses? I found the Netscape file format <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/browser/external/overview/bookmark_file_format.asp">here</a>.
