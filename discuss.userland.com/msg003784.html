Why doesn't Microsoft release their own distribution of Linux?  It's
open source, of course, and they could just package it and put the MS logo on it.<p>

I think Microsoft is now like IBM was (i.e., nobody ever got fired for buying from them).  And so now the perception of Linux as a very 
stable server platform is the big buzz.  So, if there's a Microsoft
distribution of Linux, I think it would sell tons.<p>

I guess the price couldn't be anywhere near NT's - and that it would free customers to switch to another distribution whenever they felt like it (no lock-in to a proprietary OS).  Maybe those are good enough reasons for MS not to do it... But it would be interesting!  Talk about a zig!<p>
