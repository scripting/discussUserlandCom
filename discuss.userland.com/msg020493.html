This has bugged me for a while, and it really bugged me when I saw ZopeFish going down the road to trying to clone Manila.  I didn't want to just clone something.<p>

And I saw it again with Gnome.  When I saw them talk about their "Outlook Killer," I was excited to see what new idea they'd come up with.  And the first screenshots... ...looked just like Outlook.<p>

Argh.<p>

I wanna see some thing TRULY new.<p>
