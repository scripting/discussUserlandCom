Precisely. The main difficulty with WINE's development, from what I can see, is that it has to reverse-engineer the undocumented API calls in Win32. Which raises an interesting hypothetical. If, say, one of the consequences of the anti-trust case is that MS have to release full docs to their API, then they might as well channel resources into WINE's implementation. It's a classic opportunity for "embrace and extend".<p>

And why not? The libwine GUI could, with the right support, be the fancied outsider in the race to standardise the Linux desktop.
