I don't dispute that survey, but I'll add my own data to the mix, from the <a href="http://www.robojob.com/lang.html">Robojob</a> job crawler.<p>

My engine watches the USENET job.offered feeds and counts keywords, like Java, and tries to guage the relative interest level for each.  FWIW, my numbers show Java as still a frequently asked-for skill, though I can't tell from this kind of data how much Java is actually being deployed.  My numbers go back to July 4, 1999 and don't show a big change in Java interest during that time.<p>
