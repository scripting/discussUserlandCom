Not only does it have an interesting and eclectic range of links to other web sites and articles, it also carries the personal stamp of Dave Winer, its originator.<p>

Although I have never met Dave nor spoken to him (I live in Australia), I have a strong impression of his personality and philosophy which comes through in his commentaries on all and sundry topics.<p>

He is clearly a person with a passion for what he is doing and a sense of idealism - which is a uncommon thing nowadays, especially in the world of computers and the internet.<p>

One thing I find appealing is the singlemindedness with which Dave and his team are pursuing their vision and their willingness to collaborate rather than compete with other people’s efforts. This is surely a sign of maturity.<p>
