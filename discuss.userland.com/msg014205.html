If we think of DG stories as atomic, what DG tools can you create to let an author assemble elements into a larger picture? 
<ul>
<li>a glossary type that does a server-side include/assemble instead of creating a link? 
<li>table-of-contents for the stories assembled on the page? 
<li>creating sidebars for stories that include all the links embedded in them? A "see also" list. 
<li>compositing multiple stories into a bigger story? 
<li>breaking up a long story into a seqence of pages to manage downloads? 
<li>printable versions of longer or multipage threads
<li>AvantGo-ready versions that strip out graphics and complex table structures. 
</ul>
