We have the ability to plug into our entire translator libary (15 years worth!) to handle most files. <p>

Where does this fit in? Well, our conduit for HotSync allows the xfer of data back and forth with a database that we manage. I suppose that we could extend that to write files from the Palm to the desktop, managed with our application, or we could send the data from the Palm right to a browser or Frontier via the XML-RPC mechanism, Apple Events or COM. <p>

We have created an open API into our services that allows a third party to create viewers for file types they support (on the Palm) while enabling Documents To Go to manage the data. <p>

Our viewers will eventually support notations and other data that can be entered on the Palm and xfer'd to the desktop computer, the beginnings (humble) of two way communications.<p>
