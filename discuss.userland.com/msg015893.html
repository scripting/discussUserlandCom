If someone sits down with you and points a path through all the terminology, they're both easy. Macro itself is a difficult word. Not one in common usage, and certainly not very descriptive. <p>

A macro is something small that does something big. Let's use some a conventional macros to illustrate how they work...<p>

I write 'PS' on a letter (I don't need to know it means post scriptum and I certainly don't need to know any latin) - it just works. It tells the recipient that the next sentence or two are outside context, an afterthought, a final sign-off. I don't need to write "Oh, by the way, here's another thought I had after finishing the letter" because those two simple letters do it for me. The recipient understands the 'PS' macro and fills in the blanks.<p>

Likewise on your manila site, you let the site fill in the blanks. Write &#123;day&#125; and it fills in the day, write &#123;navigatorLinks&#125; and it sticks in the navigation bar. <p>

Watch it work, play around and you'll see. It really is as easy as putting PS on a letter.
