In the MP3.com suit, it was MP3.com that was sued, not the users. MP3.com was accused of making illegal copies of CD's that were then transmitted to users (like me) who already owned a licensed copy. They weren't licensed to make and distribute digital copies to their users. It was their responsibility when buying their "master cd" to use it for licensed purposes only, private listening.
Napster users who post their content "for their own personal" use have the responsibility to make sure their not violating their licensing terms. The moment they let someone download it from their machine (allowing more than one person to listen to the song at the same time) they put themselves in the position of potentially violating the terms of their license.
This isn't even in the same ballpark as the Rio issue.
