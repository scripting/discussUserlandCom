Okay, I'm with you now.  Something like my include channel page, but more configurable:<p>

<a href="http://www.wc.cc.va.us/dtod/includeChannel/">http://www.wc.cc.va.us/dtod/includeChannel/</a><p>

Perhaps it could get the XML version and stick the various components into Javascript variables which the page author could manipulate to their heart's content?<p>
