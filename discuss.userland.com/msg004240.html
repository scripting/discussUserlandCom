I don't think Netscape's has.  If it has, someone should point out the violations of promises to TRUSTe.  And maybe we don't trust TRUSTe either; it's not like I've researched them.  I don't know how TRUSTe can really monitor what's going on anyhow... do they have access to Alexa servers?<p>

Another note, while I'm on the subject.  Do we trust AOL not to use the logs from their cache servers?  Every URL an AOL user accesses could easily be recorded.
