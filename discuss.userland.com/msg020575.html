When I was choosing an open source license for MacBird, I read the preamble to the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.html">GPL</a> and was outraged at how it talked about commercial vendors. My takeaway was "poison pill".<p>

Then after you raised the issue, I went and took another look, thinking I would copy/paste the offensive sections to the DG to show what I meant, and I couldn't find them.<p>

I assume the GPL didn't change, clearly something about me did change.
