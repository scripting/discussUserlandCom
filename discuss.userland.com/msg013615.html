This summer I was out biking, and the guy I was cycling with was telling me about his job. He works for KPMG or AA, or one of the big consulting companies.<p>

He lived in San Fransisco.  He works in Seattle. His company pays for a $1200 a month apartment in Seattle. He flies back and forth every week. His company <i>has an office in Seattle</i>. This commuting thing was supposed to last a couple of years. <p>

He mentioned inan offhand manner, that at these consulting companies, <i>you make 60-80k, but they spend 3x that on you per year. </i>  The engineering company I worked at had a salary/billing rate of something like 3 to 1. That's including profits, office, taxes and everything.  Either the consulting companies are wasting a hell of a lot of their client's money, or they're underpaying their employees and wasting their employees' money.<p>
