I haven't been to that site since, like, 1994 or something.
Its a "classic" in the same way that the site at <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~sean.hart/seal.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~sean.hart/seal.html</a> is.<p>

(Warning, the SPCA probably doesn't approve.)<p>

I remember both of these sites as links on "The Most Useless Pages on the Web" (or something like that).
Another classic page was one with just a scan of some guy's CostCo card.<p>

I guess the Useless pages site qualified as a weblog.
