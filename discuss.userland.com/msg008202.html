Umm,<p>

Since I've been censored this is a bit tough. However, no where in my message did I say/refer-to/imply "kicking back" or "this software sucks" or "endless conversations". I asked for positive acceptance of customer input and acknowledgement that said input was considered (backlog list). It's basically what I have asked of all my software vendors for the last 20 years.<p>
