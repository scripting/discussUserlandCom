Say there are three matches for a search term. The third match, because of its title, site name, and date, is the one people go to most often.<p>

Over time, that third match will increase in relevancy for that search term. It will become the top match for that search term.<p>

Now, this is an inexact science -- even if we did extensive polling it's impossible to know exactly what an individual wants every time. But given enough people using the system, this should increase the smarts over time, and it's an inexpensive way to do so, a way that requires no special set-up or user maintenance.
