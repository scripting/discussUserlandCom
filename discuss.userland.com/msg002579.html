Excellent (feature)  I sometimes need stronger typing, especially when I have large collections (Structs).  Right now, we're doing some fairly advanced e-commerce with some a large struct, that has nested structs of course!  The strong typing allows a 1:1 mapping of the XML Struct GRAPH to the Java Collection Graph.  Wham.. It's magic.  All the data is nicely organized in one object.  Gotta love it.<p>

RE>Arrays.
For some reason, arrays seem to limit (some) peoples perception of multidimensional data.  They stop at 2 or so.  Arrays are very ANTI XML IMHO. I prefer collections of data.  Collections of collections are particiularly fun.  (That's why I liked Frontiers environment so much.)<p>


For instance-- instead of multiple RPC requests, why not an RPC request that is a struct of RPC requests?<p>

Other uses for more complex structs within a nice XML value graph:<p>

Security collection: Containing public key, method, encoded data, etc.
Compression:  Large graphs of objects could be compressed/roled up for production.
