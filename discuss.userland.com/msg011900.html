Perhaps the easiest way for me to put it is: I want to know how hard it is to replicate specific aspects of my.userland.com functionality on my own, entirely separate from Userland.<p>

These aspects would be:<p>

-the content-gathering function<p>

   -periodically downloading all the registered RSS files from various
    sites<p>

-rendering these RSS files in HTML<p>

-amalgating headlines from select RSS files based on user preferences
and sorting by date, which my.userland.com does based on hour & day.<p>

Beyond this list, the script I have in mind would also be able to understand XML fields well enough so that it could use them to update an Access database. When I say "understand," I mean that it would realize that the item tag signals a collection of related information, and so on...
