The server which received the updates from Userland is written in Java and compiled down to a native Linux binary. Although this is a very powerful combination (and worked well with our own local XML-RPC calls), the technology is not super mature, and it requires all Java classes (that other JVMs may load dynamically) to be compiled and linked in advance. <p>

The problem was somewhere in the handling of TCP connections of our XML-RPC server. We haven't pinned it down yet, but sometimes when receiving an update from Userland, the server seems to have gone into something like black-hole mode, sucking in all connections, but never reading or writing back anything. <p>

One question that could help us find the problem: Did the XML-RPC calls use HTTP/1.0 or 1.1, and were there any keep-alive headers in the requests?
