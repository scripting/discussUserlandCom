It would be easy enough for someone (e.g. not Dave) to build
a "differ" which grabs the <a href="http://my.userland.com/xml/serviceList.xml">http://my.userland.com/xml/serviceList.xml</a>
file at daily intervals and creates a "what's new" list.<p>

When Dave told us to "let a thousand flowers bloom" I suspect
that this is exactly what he was talking about.<p>

Not to rain on anyone's parade, but a lot of these new hosted
weblogs are nothing to tell your mother about. Perhaps Dave
has made it <I>too</I> easy to create one. <p>

Hey Dave, perhaps you should move channels off of the archive 
list if they are dead and/or empty for a while (you could
let people commit to some update interval (day/week/month) when 
they sign up and if they don't bother to honor it then toss 
'em). Either that or force renewals every so often. Otherwise
the service list is going to get pretty full of junk.<p>
