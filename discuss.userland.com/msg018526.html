It's not for me to say what Dave's motivation is, but maybe the apparent contradiction you see has something to do with this: When people buy CDs, the artists get little to nothing. When people buy Frontier, presumably the people at UserLand actually get paid.<p>

IMO, copyright is still important, but I can still be pro-copyright and anti-RIAA. The RIAA is trying to divert attention from the real problems by waving accusations of piracy. Copyright is a technicality; it's not the big picture. When your rules don't agree with reality you should change the rules, not the reality.
