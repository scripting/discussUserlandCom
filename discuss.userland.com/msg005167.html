I think there needs to be another free trial copy of Frontier 6 - that only works with a 2.5M ODB - which is plenty of room for someone to evaluate or play with Frontier.  Lots of out-of-box experiences - which can be played with, and tutorials that lead you around - and then say "Gee if you've gotten this far - maybe it's time to pony up some bucks...."
