Personally, I'd rather see him resign than go through this impeachment ordeal, but hey, Clinton's not listening to anybody, especially me. <p>

First, if you see such a poll, please please post a pointer here. I believe that the only opinion polls that matter are ones that are restricted to people who vote.<p>

Re your other point about Clinton not listening, I believe that too. He has had a chance to become a truly great leader, any time in 1998. He had everyone's attention. If he had made a generous gesture to the Republicans, he would have undermined their zealots, and would have gotten the mandate he needs to create a historic presidency, and would have avoided impeachment. Just my opinion.<p>
