All the files that make up an operating system must be in very particular places. Same with apps and web servers. So we, collectively, decided to try to hide these things from users. A line was drawn between easy and hard to use that left the newbies lost in a world where they can't find anything they wrote more than eight hours ago, and fragile poorly understood file system structures that even a commited expert couldn't always figure out. Windows had the philosophy that it was necessary for users to see the file system. Mac users had a superior attitude, but I don't know how deserved it was. Now I hear that Windows XP is going to put the filesystem out of the users' view. And Apple is bringing Unix to Mac users, saying "Here's this strange file system, figure it out." <br><br>Moral of the story, if you sit on the bank of a river long enough eventually you'll see all operating system philosophies floating by.<br><br>That said, what does the Windows XP file system browser look like? <br><br>In my programming work I'm doing a lot of bootstraps, building things that form layers, some of which will eventually be hollow, gone, replaced by more general functionality in the next-layer-up. It's confusing at times, but very interesting work.<br><br>I've got another outage here, software-related, it's keeping me out of the news loop. It's related to last week's disk crash, that I still haven't fully recovered from. If experience is any guide, I never will fully recover from it. You just move on, the bits come and go. <br><br>There's been some discussion on the Syndication mail list as to how many RSS 0.90 feeds there are. So I wrote a script to see how many of the My.UserLand <a href="http://static.userland.com/myUserLandServices/serviceList4.xml">sources</a> were in 0.90 vs <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss091">0.91</a>. I ran it this morning. Of the sources that had updated in the last day, 23 were 0.90 and 164 were 0.91. I'll re-run the script tomorrow morning, the numbers should go up, not so many sources update over the weekend. <br><br>So many people asked about the public service message that appeared here on Sunday. "Where did it come from?" and "What's it about?" they ask, apparently puzzled. Let me answer. It came from the world we live in. And what's it about? Abuse of children. It's not about anyone in particular. There's no doubt the message evokes a strong reaction in almost everyone who reads it. But read the words carefully. It's not about you. Your name is not in the message. So whatever <i>personal</i> response it evokes is happening inside you. Nothing wrong with that. Go deeper. Listen to the voice. What is it saying?<br><br>
