Every server OS (with the possible exception of OpenBSD) will have
potentially insecure default settings. For example, properly securing
an NT server is a lot of work (remember all the things that PC week
did for their NT vs. Linux hacking contest). It's not just default
settings that are a problem. Poorly written cgi scripts can open up
gaping security holes in any OS/webserver setup.
