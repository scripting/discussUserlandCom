The Nokia toolkit has lots more simple examples. However, when testing services with the freely available toolkit, be wary - it's not 100% compatible with any of the actual Nokia phones and services that aren't tested with the actual phones will most certainly crash the phone's browser. If you sign an NDA with Nokia, you can access a much better quality toolkit.<p>

Honestly, I think WAP is one hell of a chance to UserLand since Frontier has all the functionality needed to create WAP services and more since it's apparently excellent at handling XML. However, since there's going to be multiple diffent WAP->HTTP gateways, to become a serious player in this field you would need to implement a server capable of native WAP protocols. For example, you can't find out anything about the client when you're serving WML through HTT which makes it harder to develop services that require user identification.<p>

(I'm a little disappointed with the "WAP is not HTTP" newsletter. You wouldn't have needed to dig almost at all to know better.)<p>

If you need any specs, you can dig them all from <a href="http://www.wapforum.org/">http://www.wapforum.org/</a>. <p>
