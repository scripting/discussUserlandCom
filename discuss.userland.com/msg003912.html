My last name is pronounced Tie-gee with a hard g, sounds like tiger. Here is a recent photo:	<img src="http://discuss.userland.com/raw/messages/0003912/enclosureBits" alt="Dave Theige">	I am a physician-educator and Director of Clinical Education at the <a href="http://www.med.und.nodak.edu/">University of North Dakota School of Medicine</a>.	I have a web site called <a href="http://osler.med.und.nodak.edu/">MedEd News</a> that I'm managing with Frontier 6.	I'm current president of an organization called <a href="http://www.im.org/cdim/">Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine</a>.	I've been married for 12 years to a wonderful woman. We have three children ages 9,6, and 2. For some reason, we have a puppy also.	I think that Frontier is brilliant. Learning about it has been life-changing for me. I think the next concept to change my life might be <a href="http://technography.userland.com/">technography</a>.	I'm a huge fan of the <a href="http://www.siouxhockey.com">Fighting Sioux hockey</a> and the <a href="http://www.netaxs.com/~rzepelaa/undercover/">Rolling Stones</a>.<p><p>
