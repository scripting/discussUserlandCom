(remember the adage, "be carefule what you ask for?")<p>

Artists and the industry would change focus to create only the songs that "sold". Everyone would only work on potential "hits". I think we would lose alot in the process.<p>

Television has gone through this I think. They've got it down to a science. Now the only thing that is on the tube is stuff that the majority will watch. I think everyone will agree that the quality of TV has gone down the gutter. The Network "News" is a joke. The filming of the truck that blew up, which was in fact staged by the network, is a prime example of how low they have gone in pursuit of eyeballs.
