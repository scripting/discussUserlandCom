Left to right:<p>

Guy #1. Looks the most normal in terms of dress and pose, although gripping his knee. He's taking up his space,
crossing one leg over the other. But the crossed leg is pointing away from Gates. Has a beard and mustache, but 
both are groomed. Guessing he's either a veteran of being on stage or has not much at stake in this particular 
dog-and-pony show. Looks like he's listening, but maybe forming his own opinions.<p>

Guy #2. Overdressed insecure geek? But those loafers certainly look expensive. He's taking up his space,
spreading his knees apart - but his hands are clenched and his head is down and he looks like he's in church,
feeling repentent. He's wearing a jacket that looks like it's not his usual attire 
and is so carefully groomed. Collar buttoned up. Looks like he knows his place. A "no comment"
kind of guy.<p>

Guy #3 (OK, I know this is Ballmer). Another suit, but it looks like part of him, as does the rest of his
outfit. Kind of wrinkly, shirt not buttoned up tight. Looks like a frustrated cop. The first two I might
strike up a conversation with - but not this guy. He looks angry. He too is leaning away from Gates and is 
kind of hunched over. I can imagine him knocking back a few scotches later, trying to relax. I think he spends 
much of his time thinking about himself. He's looking away from Gates. But he is sitting in front of everyone else.
His entire body language is completely contrary
to what women are taught to do in a "respect" situation. <p>

Guy #4 (Gates). If I didn't know he was Bill Gates, this person would not intimidate me
in the least. I'd listen to him gamely, and not expect much. Shirt is too big, body is too small,
and he looks like a fish. He's gesticulating madly, which is what I do when I'm 
at a loss for words. Next???<p>

Guy #5. Looks normal, engaged. Finger arrangement a bit odd. Looks like a gun or a limp
you-know...whatever, it's pointed at the floor. He face looks a bit scared or concerned
but at least it's focused on Gates. Because of this he looks like he's analyzing more than
just what Gates is saying -he's analyzing the way Bill is saying it.<p>

Maybe #1 and #2 aren't looking at Gates because Ballmer's body is blocking? <p>

At any rate, I'd pick guy #5 if I were in a conversational mood, guy #2 if I wanted to 
be totally left alone.<p>
