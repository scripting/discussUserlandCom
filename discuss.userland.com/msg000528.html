In any event, I'm thankful that I've finally met the woman of my dreams. (You can catch a glimpse of her <A HREF="http://www.ymmv.com/aboutus.html">here</A>.<p>

I also remember when, about this time in 1984, Dave had me write interrupt-driven serial port code so that he could port LBBS to the PC. The first time I tested it on Dave's Compaq luggable, there was a bad I/O port address in the DX register and the code hit the video display instead of the serial port. The screen went nuts; the refresh rate had somehow been set way too high. I rebooted the machine quickly to avoid damage. But Dave said, "Ooooh. That's cool. Let's see that again."<p>

He ran it again, and this time the internal monitor died with a "Pop!" and a faint whiff of ozone.<p>

Notwithstanding my wild experiences and butting heads with Dave, I have a lot to thank <i>him</i> for, too.<p>

Had I not gone to work for him, I would have gone over to the dark side. I'd been offered a job by Steve Ballmer... of Microsoft.<p>
