RDF was the result of many people's hard work. Ora Lassila,
Ralph Swick, Dan Connolly, Andrew Layman, Dan Brickley,
Eric Miller, Tim BL, and many others.<p>

I do not and have not claimed credit for RDF. Some of 
the ideas in MCF provided input into RDF. Even the MCF
ideas were simply concepts borrowed from Knowledge 
Representation.<p>

As for the other statements (such as the one insinuating that I
am "using" the folks at DMOZ), I am not going to dignify Dave Winer
by responding to them.<p>
