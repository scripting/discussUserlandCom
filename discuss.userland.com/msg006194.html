We only want to allow  users who have been approved for access to site A to use the discussion group.<p>

Can we add a #security script that only queries the FMPro database if the  the user is submitting the discussion group sign up form? This would keep her from having to hack mainresponder scripts.<p>

If you think that would work, what parameters would identify that the user is submitting the signup form? Is the pageTable available at the time the #security script is run? I remember reading something about it but have a little trouble finding it again.
