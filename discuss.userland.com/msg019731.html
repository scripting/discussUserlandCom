Simplistic summary: Consider two alternatives--either humanity dies in the next century, or goes on to colonize the galaxy reaching a total population of trillions. If the second option occurs, chances are overwhelming that you will be born during the colonizing-the-galaxy phase. If the first option occurs, chances are large (50% by your figures) that you will be born during the near-end-of-species phase. Since we do not observe a population of trillions, we are probably nearing the end of our species. In which case, your argument about taking new users into consideration is irrelevant...<p>Just a little something to brighten everyone's day!
