I saw The Green Mile this afternoon. The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/reviews/movies/GREENMILE.DTL&type=printable">SF Chronicle says</a> "Three hours of overstatement and schmaltz." Exactly. Skip this one. Yuck. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/reviews/movies/TOYSTORY2.DTL&type=printable">Toy Story 2</a> was better. Tom Hanks stars in both. <p>

<a href="http://brdbrain.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$80">Kate Adams' Dad</a> makes Christmas bread. "Spices from whatever part of the world may contain radioactive residues."<p>

<a href="http://nolondon.editthispage.com/People">NoLondon</a> is Robert Brook's tour of London in digital images.<p>

I signed up for LinkExchange on <a href="http://dave.editthispage.com/">dave.editthispage.com</a>.<p>

I added a <a href="http://www.editthispage.com/randomSite">Random</a> link on www.editthispage.com<p>

David Thiege's <a href="http://carpediem.editthispage.com/">Carpe Diem</a> is a news log from north of Fargo, North Dakota. That's pretty far north! <i>Oh <a href="http://www.scripting.com/wavs/fargo2.wav">yah</a>!</i><p>

<a href="http://javastuff.editthispage.com/">JavaStuff</a> has lots of Java stuff.<p>

Here's how <a href="http://keola.editthispage.com/">Keola Donaghy</a> plans to spend Christmas Eve. "Working on my site on EditThisPage.com, of course." <i>I like the "of course" part!</i><p>

Keola just <a href="http://keola.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$12">graduated</a> from the University of Hawaii, and was the commencement speaker! Mazel tov Keola. (That's Yiddish for Mahalo.)<p>

<a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/">Scott Hanson</a> is spending his German Christmas with neighbors and at church and at his <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/picture$32">farmhouse</a> with his wife. <p>

<a href="http://communalsound.editthispage.com/">Noah Glass</a> is one of the artists that works for Marc Canter in San Francisco. He's a great guy, with a lovely wife, Sonja (she's German too!) and I'm glad he's using Manila.<p>

<a href="http://wws.editthispage.com/">End the War on Freedom</a> is a well-updated weblog.<p>

<a href="http://buxus.editthispage.com/">I dig this site</a> but I don't know what they're saying. Is it Dutch? What is it about the Netherlands? So many web people there!<p>

If you're doing something special for Christmas on your EditThisPage.Com site, please send me a pointer.<p>

BTW, a request from me -- please no complaints for the next few days. They won't be heard by anyone who can do anything about it. We're going to keep an eye on the servers to make sure your work doesn't come to a halt, but we're slowing down, a lot, for the holiday. As Keola would say, Mahalo! (Did I spell it right?)
