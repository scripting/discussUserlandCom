I fell into it instantly after getting a rather late start with computers. I had a copy of ResEdit that I played with on and old Classic and then on my Quadra605. I was intrigued by what was beneath the icon.<p>

It's safe to say I spend a good percentage of my free time with computers. Frontier, TCL/TK, and reinstalling Linux (hehehe...) take up a good deal of my time. I code because I like to, I code because I think programming and computers are beautiful and have intrinsic value. They aren't just productivity tools.<p>

I see the same kind of beauty in theoretical physics (my great passion). The same things that have drawn me to the universe all my life draw me into computers.<p>

Do what you love! Do what makes you smile and gives you a feeling of accomplishment! These ideas might change as I age but often beauty and passion can defy age, wisdom, and talent. I guess I'll find out how right I am in a few decades.
