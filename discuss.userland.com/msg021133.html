If it takes you fifteen minutes to edit your message, than you shouldn't be surprised if other people take a look at it.<p>

I've shut the service down for now, but I would like to bring it back up.<p>

I'm not trying to change the culture of the DG, and I apologize for not asking in advance. It's just that where I come from, when you put something on the Web, it's on the Web, and you must deal with robots, spiders and aggregators. I guess it's a cultural difference. My apologies for not understanding.<p>

I don't think my service changes the culture that much. If you'd like, I can add an even longer delay, so that it is extremely unlikely that any unedited messages will go out. Or, I can have it wait a specified "grace period" since the message was posted.<p>

I'd like to find a way we can work together to have this resolved.<p>

Many thanks for your help, and apologies for my misunderstanding,
