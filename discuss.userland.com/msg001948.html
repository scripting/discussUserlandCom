I have a test group going at this address:<p>

<a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/htmlinterfaces/nirvanaServerDiscuss/">http://nirvana.userland.com/htmlinterfaces/nirvanaServerDiscuss/</a><p>

It's sure to have a very short life, so don't post anything there that you care about. Even so, I'm sure I'll get flame mail from some jerks who think their postings are precious, even though I've, in advance, called them jerks. <p>

Anyway, it's important that we be able to do this. I'm going for a walk now, it was harrrrd coding!
