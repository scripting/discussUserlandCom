It's a big win because my laptop has a USB port right in the side, so I can just plug in and go, instead of having to shut down and attach the dongle that provides serial and parallel ports.  It's an even bigger win because I was able to transfer an 8MB file (Apple's HAL ad) in 15 seconds!<p>

p.s.  Maybe I'm just clueless, but I can't seem to find a way to post a new top level discussion topic.  Any hints?
