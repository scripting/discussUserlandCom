That's the advantage of being in Silicon Valley, sometimes these kinds of meetings are really easy. <p>

I want to find out how Napster works on the server end. I also want to know if they want help and/or competition. I'd like to get an idea of how they plan to fight RIAA in court. Are they working with musicians? Their protocols have been reverse engineered, how do they feel about that? Would it make sense to have an XML-RPC or SOAP interface for Napster? What about syndication? Websites? Weblogs? Basically I want to breathe their air for a bit and get an idea of what that's like.<p>

Do you have any questions you'd like addressed?
