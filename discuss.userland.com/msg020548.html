I downloaded it and installed it on my Mac with no problems. Still trying to wrap my brain around just what it is/does, how to use it, what it buys me. But I'll get there.<p>

The most immediately striking thing to me, though, is that it feels an awful lot like a Frontier-based app: there's an app, a .odb database file, and the one window the app actually puts up (most of the interface is via your browser) looks/feels to me an awful lot like a MacBird card. Oh, and there's a scripts folder...<p>

I'm kinda curious about go'trieve's genesis and relationship to Frontier/Manila/Radio Userland. I'm also curious to learn how it really works for me as a user first, and as a developer second.
