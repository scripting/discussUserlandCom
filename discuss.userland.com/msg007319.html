It would be really useful to have a map or description of how Frontier handles the call from the lowest level through to sending back a response.</i><p>

I acually have <a href="http://developers.userland.com/inprogress/narrative">draft version</a> of such a document.<p>

There's really not much of a difference between case (a) and (b). Both will be handled by webserver.server, and when that script is called, not much has really happened yet.<p>

In case (b), the Frontier kernel calls inetd.supervisor whenever a client connects to the http port. This script then calls webserver.server, the daemon associated with that port.<p>

As for case (a), I am not really sure what happens before webserver.server is called (not much, obviously). Brent is our expert on this.
