XSL is currently available in several implementations on the <I>server side</I> so it's possible to do fun things with it now.  Unfortunately the XSL in IE5 is frozen in time before the XSL spec is completely finalized, so really it's "MS-XSL".<p>

For Internet use, as opposed to a one-browser environment, I don't think XSL will be useful client-side for about one to two years, as I don't think widespread adoption of it in browsers will happen until then.<p>

For me, HTML 4 (transitional) and cross-browser CSS rules for the client-side, and XML/XSL for the server/content-management side.
