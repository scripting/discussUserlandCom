my favourite story: during a critical demo, the potential
customer asks if the system has a certain feature, and the
guy doing the demo quickly draws a "screenshot" on paper and
waves it in front of the screen, while mumbling something about "optional future non-standard add-on that might look
something like this".<p>

later, when the system is delivered, the first thing that happens
is that the customer asks "hey, why did you remove that feature
from the program".  no amount of handwaving could persuade them
that it had never existed.<p>

guess some people are born with "reality distortion fields" ;-)
