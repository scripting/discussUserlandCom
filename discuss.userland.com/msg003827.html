I really don't care that they're using a Perl CGI. If Frontier can support non-ugly URLs, you'd think the huge sites could do it.<p>

But that's not nearly as bad as many sites where the URL is all numbers. I know one of those numbers is my personal tracking number (which I would like to trim off when I link to the page), but which one? StoryServer rates really low too, with URLs that are all numbers and commas; who ever heard of commas in a URL?
