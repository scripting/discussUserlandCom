They included a "Kill System" command that would do just that.<p>

Occasionally some newbie would discover the command, try it out, and it would do exactly what it said.  And so the system would go down.  After a while, because it wasn't a challenge, and because the system was a lot more fun when it was up, nobody bother trying to crash the system any more.<p>

Of course, that assumes a certain level of maturity on the part of the participants, but it's still a good stroy, and it probably qualifies as a parable.<p>
