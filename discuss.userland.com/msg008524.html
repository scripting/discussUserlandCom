Previously, Frontier's built-in webserver was implemented in UserTalk. Only the low-level TCP code was implemented in C.<p>

"Kernelizing" the webserver means converting the UserTalk scripts to C code, so they can be moved into the Frontier kernel. Generally, kernelizing a UserTalk script results in significant speed improvements, though this depends a lot on what the script does.
