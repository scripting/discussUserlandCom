I was a little put off by the description of firewalls on the Pike page. It seems to me that it is telling users that firewalls are there to monitor their actions.

Wow, I was wanting to be very respectful of network sysadmins. I think it's totally reasonable that they want to know what people are doing with the networks they're responsible for. <p>

How could I have said it so that it wouldn't have been insulting to you?<p>

Also, as Ken said, we're on the borderline of flaming out here, I'd appreciate it if everyone bent over backwards to avoid that. Thanks.
