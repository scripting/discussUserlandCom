However, I cleared the index, because I had a bogus url in #ftpsite (so none of the searchengine links worked) and I wanted to start over.<p>

Well, I tried the "initIndex" script that Dave posted <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tree$3.2.7.5">here</a>, and for the life of me, I can't figure out what's happening (or not happening, as the case may be). I run the script (located in the #tools table of one of my discussion groups) and it works for a while, but when done, there's nothing in config.mainresponder.data.searchEngine, and nothing is added to the index. If I edit or create messages in the discussion group, they are faithfully added to the index.<p>

Anyone have any ideas what's going on?<p>
