Is there any kind of companion spec for servers? Like xml-rpd? (Remote procedure Definition).  Meaning  is there any kind of spec for folks who want to wire up / enable rpc on their servers, but want to use a standards-based way of doing it?<p>

Say I wanted to implement a calendar on the server which talked xml-rpc.  I want to be able to create this "something" which say used perl.  I want then to be able to send this code to say a python person, who all they have to do is rip out the little perl components and replace them with python, and have essentially the same exact component.
