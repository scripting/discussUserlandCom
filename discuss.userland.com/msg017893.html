I think the honest brutal truth is that our money people are as slimy as the ones in Hollywood.<p>

It's not just economics. These are artists, they are vulnerable on a personal level. They have been screwed bigtime. We can't just send A&R people to meet them, we have to send their counterparts from the software world.<p>

I have a few friends, but I don't know how the other artists view them. I know Todd Rundgren and Adam Curry. I'm going to try to navigate in there through pop.com (see note on Scripting News).<p>

I know other people, who are probably on the other side of this one, and I'm not sure I should go to them for advice.
