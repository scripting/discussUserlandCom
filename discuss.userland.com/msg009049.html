Say what you want about Microsoft, but I think they done a very good job, if not a perfect one, of maintaining Win32 API binary and behavioral compatibility over three major releases. And the Win32 API is massive, with much more functionality than, say, the Linux kernel and the various X Windows-based toolkits put together. And Apple has pulled off something comparable with MacOS -- I've got ten-year old share applications that work just fine under MacOS 8.6.<p>

It will be interesting to see how Linux evolves once there is a significant non-geek/server installed base.
