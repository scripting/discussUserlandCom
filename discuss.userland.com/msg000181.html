I'm told the group works on projects around the $1 billion dollar mark and handling system integration for 20,000 to 30,000 computers.<p>

I will be working with internal IBM folks, IBM's clients, and other client consulting resources such as Arthur Anderson, etc.<p>

It is quite an opportunity and very challenging.
