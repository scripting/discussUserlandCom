<b>General Comments:</b><p>

<ul>
<li>Frontier could easily be scripted to keep versions of  the outline as it changes.  This would preserve the 'history', or  'process' of the decisions made in the meeting, as represented by the final outline.<p>

<li>As far as the ancillary documents (spreadsheets, reports, etc.) prepared for the meeting, they could be made available and linked from the main outline.<p>

<li>How to handle notes made between meetings? (discussion group interaction)  In a live meeting, this is trickier, because we need a way to import data into Frontier (from Palm Pilots, scribbles, etc.)  However, in a virtual meeting, this is relatively easy--use Frontier 6's discussion groups.
</ul><p>

<b><i>So, here's the question. How can we use the power of Frontier to manage all those documents?</i></b><p>

<ul>
I think Frontier running on as a server will provide the flexiblity you'll need to record all your notes, documents, and decisions.  The Frontier server will run an interactive website, which will be the main interface for displaying and accessing the documents.<p>

Here's a list of features you'll probably need for this interactive project website, and if they already exist or need to be coded:<p>

<ol>
<li>News Page - A  page that participants can read to find the latest updates, documents, schedules, etc. I believe Dave has something for news that will be in Frontier 6.<p>

<li>Discussion Group - available in Frontier 6.  This is a forum where meeting participants can voice their own opinions and come to consensus.  Important threads can be linked to from the news page. Consensus summaries can be part of the Discussion group and become part of the formal meeting documents. <p>

<li>Documents Archive -  Basically an asset management system--in this case, your assets are your meeting documents (excel files, outlines, text, pdfs, Project files).  Meeting members need a simple ways to submit documents to the Archive--they should be able to submit via the web, email, ftp, or directly from their own copy of Frontier . -- Userland has something called ContentServer that could be modified for this; I imagine you'll need some custom coding here. ( I'd code the Doc Archive as a special type of discussion group)<p>

<li>Search Engine -  enables meeting members to find information quickly. There's a good search engine in F6.<p>

<li>Outline Historian - a special module that allows you to 'register' the main meeting outline at  various times throughout the meeting.  When the outline is registered, that particular version of the outline will be named, dated, saved and stored in the Doc archive.  the main outline can link to any document in the archive, or  to any  message in the discussion group.  It can also be outputted in many formats (web, print-ready, plain-text, pdf). -- custom code needed here.<p>

<li> Integration - You'll need someone who can stitch all these parts together, and write the custom code to make it work.
</ol><p>

Lastly, a comment.  I come to Technography from a web-builder's perspective.  Echoes of your ideas are in David Siegel's book  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568303823/o/qid=920052391/sr=2-2/002-2106983-7268861">Secrets of Successful Websites: Project Management on the World-Wide Web</a>.  His ideas about a 'project site' and 'project management methodology'  are right on.  Frontier would make the ultimate 'project site' building tool. (Doing  a project for a client is basically one 6-8 month meeting...)<p>
