Actually, it is *an* answer and would help for some projects such as building a fancy new application that used IM.<p>

But many of this things people want to do should not require an army of programmers. Often, *no* programming is necessary. So the "S" in SDK would impose too large a burden on domain experts who are not programmers but simply want to add some functionality to their website. For example, a link that sends an Instant Message when clicked or one that makes the user get real-time updates about some event during the next ten hours. <p>

Such features should be implementable in plain HTML or XML by anybody who can write ASCII and have it served up from a hosting service in Pittsburgh where they can't touch anything except FTP files onto the file system.
