I've been using USWest DSL (256K) since early September and I am very happy with it.<p>

1. It took about 3 weeks to from the time I scheduled the install until I got hooked up.<p>

2. Two days after the initial install, I lost my connection and could not reestablish it.  It took 2 days of phone calls getting passes back from USWest service to USWest.net (ISP) before I finally screamed loud enough for them to send a service person out. This was on a Saturday morning and they told me it would probably be the next week before they could get someone out.  The service guy showed up about 20 minutes later. After checking the wiring, we determined it was my SpeedRunner "modem". He had a spare and replaced it and I have been up and running ever since.<p>

3. It appears to be as fast as advertised, but I don't think there are that many users sharing the pipe yet.<p>

4. Very reliable.  No downtime since early September. Also, a nice bonus, although they use DHCP (unless you spring for static ip's) my ip has not changed since I originally plugged in.  My computer is always on (except the occasional reboot between Win98 and Linux), and always gets the same ip address from the DHCP server.<p>

5. No existing LAN.<p>

6. Check your bills carefully.  There has been a number of reported overbillings mentioned on the uswest dsl newsgroup.  I was one of them.  There was a special $110 setup that they screwed up on and I ended up with a $600  phone bill. It was relatively easy to fix, but it was still a pain.<p>

BTW, the total monthly cost for 256K is around $75 (includes ISP charge).
Good luck!<p>
