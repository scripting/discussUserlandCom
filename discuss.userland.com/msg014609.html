Some Mac users think we should only use features that work on Macs. Someday the Mac will catch up and we'll want to know how to do this stuff. Enough waiting. Buy Macs as web browsing machines with your eyes open. You won't be able to use all the sites on the web, until Apple catches up.<p>

He could then create a file called Penguin. He then can, in turn, create a file called PENGUIN. All three of these, though they have the same name, are different files because of the distinction Linux makes between files with the same name but different case."<p>

The XML-RPC mail list is being <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/xml-rpc/?isDecendingSort=0&searchStart=613&isThreaded=0&fetchForward=0&start=613">bombarded</a> by a fellow named Phil Montgomery from <a href="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</a> running some kind of vacation program. It's exponential. His stupid agent is <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/xml-rpc/?isDecendingSort=0&searchStart=601&isThreaded=0&fetchForward=0&start=601">responding</a> to its own messages! Helllp. He's at a strategic conference in Atlanta. Maybe they need a new strategy? His cellphone number is included in the emails. 801-319-3537. I left him a voicemail last night. If anyone from Novell is tuned in, your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to turn the damned vacation program off. <p>
