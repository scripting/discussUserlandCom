Store (<a href="http://www.donatefood.org/">http://www.donatefood.org/</a>) directly to CyberCash for automated order processing, Yahoo! &/or CyberCash weren't ready to complete the loop.  This was 11/98, but I don't expect that the situation has changed yet.<p>

I was disappointed - I had read a marketing piece that claimed Yahoo! Store could connect with CyberCash and similar services, but I guess the key word must have been could, not does. (not a direct quotation)  Probably just a rumor that propogated, but it seems Yahoo! Store underestimated their time to market on this one.
