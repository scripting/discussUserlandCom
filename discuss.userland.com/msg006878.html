Is this available? It would be really useful. I have recently converted our corporate intranet site to Frontier 6 (from Webstar/Frontier 4) and Frontier 6 is doing a great job in many respects, but a large part of the site is static (html, pdf rather than graphics) so I want to go back to WebStar to serve this stuff and leave Frontier to handle the real dynamic stuff, and some guidance on this would be great.<p>
