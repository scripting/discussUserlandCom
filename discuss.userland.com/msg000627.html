one thing that makes using the web jarring is
the lack of smooth transitions between pages.  
how about if the following things happened when
you clicked on a link, instead of the current 
flash and draw of the new page.<p>

1. you click on a link, which hopefully
have been prefetched (using a "preload" tag)<p>

2. a logical diff is applied comparing the content
of the current page to the content of the next page.<p>

3. an animated transition is synthesized based on
the positions of paragraphs and images.<p>

4. things that are not on the new page are faded
out, new content fades in, and images changing in
size are animated to make a smooth transition.<p>


another idea is to use a multi-column page oriented
layout of the content of web pages instead of this
terrible scrolling interface provided by mcdonalds
and burger king.
