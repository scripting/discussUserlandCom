For quite some time, Helmut Dersch has been making freely available an application and source code to stitch together images that were shot with a fisheye lens. Then last April 8th, IPIX forced Helmut Dersch to
close his website, a very helpful set of internet pages with lots of
useful, free programs for the QTVR / Panoramic VR community. Why? IPIX  has a patent on stitching together two images shot with a fisheye lens. Many in the panoramic photography community have knowledge of prior art, but who has the kind of money needed to fight these patents in court? The International QTVR Association has a page on the question of IPIX at <a href="http://www.iqtvra.org/noipix.html">http://www.iqtvra.org/noipix.html</a>
