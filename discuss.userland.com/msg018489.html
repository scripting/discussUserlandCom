No surprise there. This brings to mind something Robert Heinlein wrote:<p>"There has grown up in the mind of certain groups in this country that because a man or corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged with the duty of protecting such a profit in the future, even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary to public interest. This strange doctrine is not supported by statute or common law. Neither individuals nor corporations have the right to come into court to ask that the clock of history be stopped, or turned back."<br>

That way those of us who want to support the artist can do it, without shelling out $18 that mostly goes to a record company, for a CD we don't need.
