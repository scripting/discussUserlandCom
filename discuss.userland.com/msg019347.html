Help us out on this. We did a quick look at their interface, but it doesn't do what we need it to do. We need to be able to send it a song to play and have it either wait before returning or call back to us when the song is finished playing. A simple COM interface is what's called for, near as I can tell <i>none</i> of the music playing apps on Windows do this. I would love to hear otherwise, whoever supports this kind of interface would rule our world from the music-playing side of things.<p>

I just want a couple of easy calls. Play this file and tell me when it's finished or tell me if the user clicked on Stop. That's it.
