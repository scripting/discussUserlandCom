* This IM war is playing into Microsoft's hands, now AOL is even mistreating its own clients by preventing them from communicating with people using MS IM. Every passing day the $180 million investment in Mirabilis is looking worse and worse for stock holders..<p>

* I can get free access (28.8) to all of the interesting content on the Internet, or I can pay the same amount as AOL and get DSL access.<p>

* Whenever I hit a URL that starts with members.aol.com I just give up, its useless waiting for that to load.<p>

* They just conclusively lost the browser wars and they dont have a convincing entry in the server market.<p>

* The AOL Stigma: AOL == clueless spamming newbies in most cluefull people's minds..<p>
