Next week we will release, in source code, a pilot project to begin movement in the direction of hosting of Frontier-managed sites on Linux. (Have I hedged enough??)<p>

We're using Zope, and the excellent XML-RPC package built by Fredrik Lundh. We're also partnering with Digital Creations, the developers of Zope.<p>

We read it the same way you do. NT for content management groupware, Linux for deploying sites that get millions of hits a day. We're going with the industry-standard formula. It's most important to scale, so we go with the flow.
