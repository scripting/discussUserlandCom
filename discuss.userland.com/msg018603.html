<I>"Information -- raw, unfiltered information -- is not the same as news."</I><p>

True enough... but where on earth is this "raw, unfiltered" information anyhow?  Dave <I>is</I> a filter (among other things, not to pigeonhole him "qbullet.smiley"), and so is most every weblog... that's most of what my weblog is when it gets down to it.<p>

No admission to being an "ink-stained fuddy duddy from yesteryear" in the first few sentences can do anything in my mind to defuse the blatently <B>egotistical</B> nature of implying that only <I>he</I> and his buddys are the 'right' filters.<p>

Ego trips like these are actively insulting to us readers.  <I>Yes, we can live without you filtering the news for us;</I> we can filter for ourselves, the decentralized distributed Web way.  Certainly the news needs filtering, but there's <B>nothing magical</B> about the old press way of doing it, and certainly nothing divinely ordained about it!  <p>

Deal with it.
