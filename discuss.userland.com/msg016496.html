Probably about the same. Maybe more productive because Python is easier to program. But more people use Perl, so you might find what you need is already written.<p>

<i>Also, how fast is the connection to mySQL? I heard that its not fine as what Perl as to offer.</i><p>

I've no idea. Try it and see if it's fast enough for you. <p>

<i>And last but not least, is there a fast equivalent of Python to HTML::Mason (Perl) or PHP?</i><p>

Yes. It's called <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>.<p>

No one leaves Python to use Perl for Web programming. People switch from Perl to Python. A generalisation to be sure, but generally true.
