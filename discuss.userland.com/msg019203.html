I think it's valid concept, its just that putting money into the pockets of those leaches after yesterday's, to make a point or not, just rubs me the wrong way.
By buying online through alternative distribution points we make the same point: we have the money and are willing to spend it. <p>

I also have doubts that the anticipated coverage would materialize either. Time-Warner == CNN. What other incestuous relationships are there between the RIAA and the press? Mass media hasn't gotten a lot of the facts right on many of the major issues in the Napster case, and it probably isn't simple ignorance; more like deliberate misinformation. Are they going to make a demonstration like this a headline event? Or it would read like this "An upswing in CD sales is hailed by the recording industry as proof that Napster users were reducing artist income. With their source of free music cut off, former Napster pirates are now forced to buy the music through legitimate sales channels. Film at 11..."<p>

If something like this comes together I'd probably participate because when I disagree with Dave, he tends to be right ";->"<p>
