at least that was the theory.<p>

fwiw, the same thing applies to Sweden (I'm a trained soldier,
as are most others in my generation), but we seem to be slowly
drifting away from that entire concept.  to the extent we ever
believed in it -- I don't think anyone ever thought that it was
the Swedish army in itself that kept us outside the WW2, and
during the cold war, the goal was pretty much to be strong
enough to stay alive until NATO forces arrived...<p>


wars aren't what they used to be -- today, I don't think we
would be able to cope with a massive NATO bomb campaign any
better than the serbs, for instance.<p>


in addition, a high european NATO official recently pointed
out that the US spends nearly four times more money on weapons
research than all european countries combined.  we simply
cannot keep up, and I find that a bit worrying in several
ways.<p>


(as an aside, the US defense budget is some 20% bigger than
Sweden's GNP.  you do have a lot of money to spend over
there ;-)
