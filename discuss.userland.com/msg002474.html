I like distributed computing, and think it is one of those research areas that has been underutilized by compercial OS vendors ... but I'm not sure how Jini will play.  I'd have thought that the best use of distributed techniques would be to build robust, fault-tollerent, office networks.<p>

Sun seems to be targeting small devices with Jini.  I can see some utiltiy there ... keeping your Pilot sync'd might be easier if it was all distributed objects ... we'll see.
