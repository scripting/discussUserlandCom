Now I only can access it via a URL that's not acceptable to me. I'd like to Frontier to serve the page called index in mySite.root when the URL "http://localhost/" is requested by the browser. My guess is I need to modify config.mainresponser.domains. I tried several values but can't get it to work. Any help would be appreciated. If anyone has pointers to in depth documentation on Frontier 6 I would welcome these!<p>

Kind regards,<p>
