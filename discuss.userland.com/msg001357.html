This is a interesting point: Will Frontier be scalable to multiple machines? It's one of the big selling points of a system like WebObjects--scalability and load-balancing.<p>

While trying to compete with systems like WebObjects is another subject entirely, distributed Frontier apps are definitely something to think about. Actually, the current client/server system I'm designing now is a distributed app.<p>

I think we may get to a point where a Frontier based system may span several server machines on a LAN, all doing their own tasks.  I can easily imagine one server for searches, another for user registration and profiling, another for SQL database queries, etc.<p>
