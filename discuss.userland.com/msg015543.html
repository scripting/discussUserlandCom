I bought The Brain a while ago, because it's such a fascinating concept. But it's just one attempt in an area where many people have had interesting ideas for years. If they follow through and make a great product, fine - but if they don't, they should get out of the way when someone else takes the next step. <p>

There has been no significant updates for a long time, developer support sucks and there are few serious applications in sight. Check out their discussion board - lots of users love the idea, but wonder if the product has been abandoned. <p>

I feel sick when a company brags that their patent <i>"creates a significant barrier to entry for companies considering developing similar technology"</i>. They are not even close to doing what they are doing well enough, and maybe they never will - yet they try to stop the rest of the world from competing with better technology.<p>

I am also wondering just how bad their patent is.
