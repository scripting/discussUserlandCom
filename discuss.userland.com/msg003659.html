_Linux_Application_Development_, Addison Wesley. This doesn't cover GUI programming, but provides an excellent overview of the process model and other nitty gritty things. Highly recommended.<p>

_The_Single_Unix_Specification_, The Open Group. You can order this from <<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/">http://www.opengroup.org/</a>> or browse it online. It provides the "official" reference documentation for portable Unix programs, and about 98% of it applies to Linux. The Linux Standard Base project is working on the other 2%.<p>

Anything ever published by O'Reilley. Really, you can't go wrong here. They document APIs, scripting languages, security and even Linux-specific features. A few of their manuals have problems, but the average quality is remarkably high.<p>

As for GUI development, you have three real choices. Motif is mature, so you can find oodles of books and tutorials and application-building tools. Unfortunately, Motif is somewhat cumbersome to program, and its future is uncertain thanks to reorgs at the Open Group. Lots of books have been written about Motif; just pick one.<p>

The KDE project has good documentation online; try browsing from <<a href="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</a>>. If you like programming in C++, you'll find that the APIs are nice and TrollTech provides do or die support for about $1700/seat. It's a bargain--TrollTech is the same company which wrote a new Netscape front end in 5 days and got an Opera prototype working on Linux in three weeks. Scuttlebutt says they're a class act.<p>

Gnome's documentation is still incomplete. I've been working from manuals-in-progress and sample code. (Because Gnome is an open source desktop, finding sample code is *not* a problem.) RedHat's hired a good tech writer to work on the online documentation, and no less than three books are in the pipeline. You can start by reading the material at <<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">http://www.gtk.org/</a>> and then hoping over to <<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</a>>. You can write Gnome apps in several languages. C, C++, Objective C and Python are the best supported. For people who like scripting languages, check out PyGnome--Python's a sweet little language, and the Gnome bindings are fairly mature. To be honest, only early adopters will want to write Gnome software right now.<p>

I do this stuff for a living, so don't hesitate to ask questions. I'm more than happy to answer Linux questions for the discussion group or individual developers. As a former Macintosh user, I owe some of you folks *big* favors. :-)
