I myself run Frontier on 8.6.<p>

I looked through the Frontier-Users list on this topic, and here's a summary of things to check:<p>

1) Are you running OSA Menu? If so, try disabling it.<p>

2) If you have Iomega drivers, are they up-to-date?<p>

3) Have you applied the Font Manager Update?<p>

4) How much memory is allotted to Frontier?<p>

Then there are things to try no matter what OS you're using:<p>

1) Have you done a Save a Copy on all your guest databases and Frontier.root?<p>

2) Have you tried using a completely fresh copy of Frontier to see if the problem still occurs?<p>

3) Have you set up logging so it only goes to guest databases, and not to outlines or text files?<p>

4) Have you disabled the Changes Pages feature?<p>

5) Can you isolate what Frontier's doing when it hangs? If it's in the same set of code every time, that would definitely be worth knowing.
