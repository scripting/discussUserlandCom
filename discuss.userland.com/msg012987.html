There's a C library that'll handle most of the functionality you need. It's available at <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net//graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.uu.net//graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz</a> and isn't <b>that</b> difficult to port to Mac or Windows.<p>

I'm currently writing up the vacation I took in October for the web and sorting through the pictures I took with my digital camera. I used Frontier to tell Adobe ImageReady to do all my thumbnailing (becuase I already had ImageReady, and this is a fun project that's already taken longer than I'd hoped, so I want to finish before it quits being fun), otherwise I'd consider porting the library, but I agree that having a suite that could do that would be handy.<p>
