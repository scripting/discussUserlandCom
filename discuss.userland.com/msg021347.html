Ecco into the year Y2K. That is, to create tools to allow it to interact in a world of Webtop rather than Desktop applications, and to create libraries for non-Visual Basic programming.<p>

I've posted some very preliminary Perl code for turning one's Ecco phonebook into a Web page. Next to come: Automatic FTPing of that page to a Web server. A Perl ECCO module is down the road.<p>

Raymond Yee has posted code for posting Ecco outlines to Manilla, using Python and XML.<p>

I would love to see some Frontier developers join the effort. I can imagine an Ecco-Frontier/RadioUserland package that eliminates all the messy glue of Perl, FTP and Apache that I envision in my app.<p>

I've also posted some questions about the compatability of Frontier's database with that of Ecco's. <p>

<B>P.S.</B> Why now? Because the programming creativity surrounding RadioUserland is contagious. Those "whatif"s that keep cropping up on scripting news -- whatif a playlist was an outline, whatif an outline was a website, whatif the desktop was a webtop -- turn out to be catching. So two words for Dave: Thank You!
