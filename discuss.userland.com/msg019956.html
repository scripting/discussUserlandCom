Is it open source if it's so heavily politicized or has it become something else? What if you believe in love not war? Can you be an open source developer without endorsing the death penalty for Microsoft? Why do so many agendas have to be attached to acts of simple generosity? Is it OK if your software is used in acts of war?<br><br>	BTW, thanks for all the great email. A lot of developers want to talk about this stuff for sure. I should have asked the questions a long time ago, but there are people who get angry with me for even <i>asking</i> what open source is. That's their problem, it used to be mine. I wrote a <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/08/22/squealWithCare">piece</a> yesterday saying I'm going to ask all the questions I want to. Making it personal will only double my resolve to get to the bottom of the issues. <br><br>	<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20024">Next question</a>. Did open source software exist before the term was coined?<br><br><b>Brent kicks butt<a name="brentKicksButt">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/23#brentKicksButt" title="Permanent link to 'Brent kicks butt' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I just used Radio UserLand to <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/usingRadioUserLandAsADGBrow.gif">browse a discussion group</a> for the first time. I saw a message that I wanted to respond to. I right-clicked on it and chose Reply from the popup menu. A window opens. Enter my response. Save. Edit. Save. I don't think it can get much easier than this. Voila. Two-Way-Web. <br><br>	Also, just to show we have a sense of humor, the default icon for discussion group messages is the cow skull. To the people who don't like it, you can customize it.<br><br>	The new features, and there are lots of them, will go out through updates to Radio UserLanders later this evening.<br><br><b>After many fruitless hours<a name="afterManyFruitlessHours">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/23#afterManyFruitlessHours" title="Permanent link to 'After many fruitless hours' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	I had to rewrite a tricky bit of code in the cloud to handle larger numbers of files and then forgot how everything was configured, but now I have the basic directory stuff working, and am going to start work on dressing it up visually and adding the rocket science.<br><br>	Here's the <a href="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/html/directory/userland/index.html">directory</a> for userland.com.

It's just an <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/directoryEditorEarly.gif">outline</a>, the whole site is rendered in less than a second from one document, that's usable as a bookmarks file on its own.
