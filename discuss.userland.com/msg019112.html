On my machines, quicktime refuses to recognize about half of the mp3s that I try to play. <p>

Dunno why. They seem to play fine when I go download some other player.  I'm currently trying out soundjam mp, which let me rip an lp last night. Sound quality is ok, given that it's an old lp and I'm digitizing through an iMac.<p>
