Basically it's like the Mac Chooser.<p>

The IETF has their own take on automatic resource discovery called the <a href="http://www.srvloc.org/">Service Location Protocol</a>. SLP isn't compatible with Jini, but it does pretty much the same thing as Jini's discovery protocol and doesn't require Java.<p>

I'd imagine that you could combine XML-RPC and SLP with no changes in either spec.
