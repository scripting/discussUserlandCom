Rainier one weekend, and we were looking for the marmots.  She feels connected with them somehow.<p>

We spotted one on a ridge across the way, and we were trying to line the cameras up on it, when I looked down to check my footing.<p>

About a foot away was this huge marmot, just staring up at me, wondering what I was doing.  It was one of those moments where you want to say something to get the other persons attention -- you open your mouth, but nothing comes out.  I finally got my wife's attention, and the marmot just wandered off, going to do whatever it is marmots do.<p>

Personally, I think they're plotting world domination.<p>

It was a wonderful little nature encounter.<p>
