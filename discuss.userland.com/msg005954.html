Hey Dave: I was most greatful of your Windows newbie list when I was switching to Windows as a Mac user. Wouldn't it be great to have a Linux newbie list for us Mac and Windows folk (there are a lot of us)?<p>

2. I downloaded RH6.0 and burned a CD. I installed with this, using the 'Workstation' config option. It boots with Gnome window manager. I want to use KDE, which IS supposed to be there. But I can't figure out how to switch (the Desktop Switch menu only lists Gnome). Most importantly, I can't figure out where to find the information. Redhat doesn't seem to have any specific help for their 6.0 install--and from what I understand they have a unique configuration of KDE 1.1.1 specific for Red Hat 6.0. Generic Linux How-tos, KDE FAQs haven't helped me so far. Any advice pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated from anyone.
