In the architecture of Frontier 6, Discussion Groups are central, so being an HTML interface on content stored in a DG is a good thing. It means that your content gets an Edit this Page button. That's a pretty big deal in my book. <p>

The reason why we have overrides for config.mainresponder.urls is to give you more power. If you don't want to use it you don't have to. But if you want a second or third (or fourth or fifth) DG on your server you do have to understand how to override the URLs table.
