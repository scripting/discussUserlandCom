How Python compare to Perl (Linux/Apache) for doing CGI.?<p>

With mod_pyapache, is it fast as Perl with mod_perl?<p>

Also, how fast is the connection to mySQL? I heard that its not fine as what Perl as to offer.<p>

And last but not least, is  there a fast equivalent of Python to HTML::Mason (Perl)  or PHP?<p>

I want to know if I should invest more in Python  (for which I find the syntax very elegant, and clean) to do web related work that run on Linux, or just stick to Perl (that I like a lot).<p>

Cheers<p>
