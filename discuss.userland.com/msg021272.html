but i'm guessing that, at least with respect to radio.userland, we should keep in mind that we're talking "radio", not composition. (i admit that i am changing the frame of reference here, and probably the nature of the thread).<p>

an internet radio station might well support hypertextuality. <p>

as well as the obvious (fan weblogs, ratings, polls, commentary et al), this could include some interesting pov's on music itself driven by software capabilities --<p>

provide multiple versions of a song, ranging from rehearsal to recorded to live to bootleg to ...<p>

ability for listener-users to edit music as well as playlists (and retransmit, thus looping back on the versioning described above)<p>

creation of (semi) multi-media "performances" of music that include video, animation, graphics or, for that matter, augmenting texts<p>

creation of interactive communities of "fans" that co-produce (? too strong a term) music with bands through near real-time, daily feedback loops<p>

again, i have shifted the frame. you may be right about music from the "creative" perspective unless (big unless) what i describe can fairly be considered a part of a new kind of "creative perspective" for music composition, enabled by the Web and, perhaps, by applications like Radio Userland.
