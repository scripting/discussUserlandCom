As a regular reader, I have no problem reading stuff I don't always agree with. The only thing that bothers me is that sometimes your mind is welded shut. Especially when you might be wrong.<p>

The Stuffed Dog had an opinion some of your comments (and I agree with them). You seem to have ignored the content, while deriding the style. Perhaps we are too 'immature' to see that our opinions are wrong. I hope not: it would not reflect well on your readership, for I and The Stuffed Dog are obviously regular readers.<p>

Sometimes, it is difficult to imagine alternate points of view. A second opinion is a good place to start. Here is a thought experiment for you to try: start with the assumption that your opinion is wrong.
