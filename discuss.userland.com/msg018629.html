I like it. A few comments:<p>

Note that I viewed the pages with NN 4.07 on WinNT 4.<p>

You forgot to provide a magnifying glass. The body type is very small, and the footer type is virtually illegible. (I was able to find the <b>about this site</b> link at the bottom only by squinting and by knowing that it must be there somewhere.)<p>

A typo from the <b>about this site</b> page:
HTML & JavaScrip authoring<p>

A usability problem I discovered when I tried to select and copy the above string from the page: It wasn't highlighted in any way to indicate selection. I carefully dragged the mouse over the text where it should select it, and copied, and--lo and behold--I actually got it; but I had no idea whether I'd actually managed to copy the text until I pasted it into this message. Something's not quite right, there.<p>
