The way this is usually done is you tell us what you've done and you ask if it's OK to use our servers this way.<p>

We may not be set up to handle this.<p>

You may not bring the manners you use on mail lists to this DG. I know you're a young man, but I am not your father, or brother, or even a friend of yours. This is our server, not a public resource to be used any way you want.
