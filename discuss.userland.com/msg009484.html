However, he did choose to send info to Dave's email, rather than post it on a discussion group, and Dave did read the entire message prior to posting it.  I don't want to turn this into some sort of emotional argument, but I personally enjoy receiving personal email from friends and strangers.  I personally wouldn't betray that trust by going against the stated intention of those who send me messages.<p>

Of course Dave had the "right" to post what he received;  I'm just saying it was bad form.
