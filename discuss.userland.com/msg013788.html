I think I'm taking a similar tack to Josh:<p>

I read the currentStories.xml file once an hour (like Josh, I had to read the instructions several times to realize that I wasn't meant to read it every minute).  I use the stories in that file as a cue to reload the RSS/scriptingNews files from their original sites (by cross-referencing with serviceList2.xml).<p>

The next step is to implement javascript client-side includes, which should be easy.<p>
