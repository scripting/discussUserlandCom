...with every new message we're pushing Frontier's object database into uncharted territory. I must say I am very pleased with the reliability of the odb, on the path to 10K messages there hasn't been a single database glitch.

Hello all,<p>

I have a read only DG (discussion group) that has about 12,200 messages in it right now.  Frontier's odb (object database) has done a great job of handling this number of messages.<p>

Heh.  I guess you could say I'm deeper into the uncharted territory! :-)  Come on down!  The odb is fine! He he.
