i agree here, and i really wonder if something as serious as a tax is really called for in the IM realm.<p>

what's the upside for the user in open-standards IM? is this just open standards for the sake of ... open standards?<p>

saying Open Standards Are Good, Period is one thing for a private company to do in determining what products to pursue. it is quite another in the case of a government deciding whether to extend coercive bureacracy. the government has an obligation to really think things out.<p>

as an occaisional IM user, and former occaisional IRC user, i have no problem with AOL controlling this space. the software runs on my 68k mac, which is rare these days, it is free, it is easy-to-use, it doesn't censor my speech. it is feature-rich. so what if it isn't standards-based?<p>

this isn't like the old telco monopoly. if aol stagnates or censors or gets buggy, i can switch very easily to a competitor. if the competitors disappear in a year, they will quickly rise again if aol drops the ball.<p>

a tax for open-standards IM would be a bad precedent.
