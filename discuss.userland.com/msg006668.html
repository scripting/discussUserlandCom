Ah... I see. None-the-less, this is coooool.<p>

Some of the xml-based publishing vendors (Poet comes to mind) are developing component-level editing in their systems. It's not nearly as elegant as what you're describing, but it could be an interesting addition to Manila. An interesting UI problem, to be sure; it would be a challenge as well to decide how granular the editing interface should be. I'd like to see things like editing a component, such as a list of links, or news stories, by clicking on an "edit this object" link/button. This could be implemented easily on the rendering side by swapping outline renderers mid-stream. Storing the components in the ODB should be a breeze... someone's just got to hook it together!<p>

While I'm on it, hooking this editing system into the membership system would add the ability to control who can edit which bits of the site- when logged in, the user gets links on each component which they have permission to edit.<p>

I get dizzy thinking of the possibilities!<p>
