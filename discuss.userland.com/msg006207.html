The list is just getting started, yesterday I wrote the welcome message for the mail list, and am cc'ing it here so a discussion can go on in both places. The main purpose of the mail list is to coordinate work in this area around the myUserLand.root source code release, and to foster a cooperative development environment.<p>

<b>Welcome!</b><p>

First, I'd like to officially welcome everyone to this new mail list.<p>

I chose the name "portals" to be the list for myUserLand.root because that's what I think it is. The idea is to have a distributed portal. Not just one central node that everyone hits, but to have servers that add value and services that in some way process, display, or possibly limit access to content that flows thru the network.<p>

<b>Some ideas<ul></b><p>

<li>One node could index all that content that flows thru it. It would subscribe to a set of channels that define an interest area and index all the articles in the selected channels. We've already done something like this for <scriptingNews> format, and have it running at <a href="http://newssearch.userland.com/">NewsSearch.UserLand.Com</a>.<p>

<li>Another node could offer display services, as Josh Lucas is doing. Another could provide special display services for people who use MSIE5 or Mozilla 6.0, or Flash, or whatever. Or people with visual impairment.<p>

<li>Another node could offer more customization, or could host agent scripts that watch for articles in a certain area and send the users email or a fax. Or have escalation routines, if you can't find me on email, then try calling me. Another one could be the beeper port.<p>

<li>A node on an internal network could mix public channels with channels that are private to people within the organization, and have some of its internally generated channels available to the public, and others that are only available to their suppliers. This has applications in publishing, where the suppliers are writers and columnists.
</ul><p>

<b>Study the competition</b><p>

There's lots of prior art to study. Become a member of yahoo.com, xoom.com, hotmail.com, my.netscape.com, homestead.com, learn about the field and look for ways that a decentralized network of content aggregators can do things that the single-server based ones can't. That's our opportunity space.<p>

<b>Other directions</b><p>

RSS is a limited format. <scriptingNews> is richer. Somehow we have to integrate <scriptingNews> format into myUserLand.root.<p>

<b>Where are we going?</b><p>

UserLand's current direction is to build content tools for writing and managing sites that flow out thru these channels. We're going to put some great editorial tools around this concept, and servers that generate RSS files to flow thru this network that we hope develops.<p>

<b>Who are you?</b><p>

I'd like to find out who's here, what your interests are and where you'd like to see this go. And if you want to contribute programming work to the project, even better!<p>

My invite to open source this is real. I wrote about it on discuss.userland.com. I would really like to see an independent community-based development effort gather around this. We could really go places.<p>
