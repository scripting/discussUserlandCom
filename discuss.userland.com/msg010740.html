This should attract a few CORBA advocates and maybe we can figure out how to bridge to their world. I agree with you, to me CORBA looks like one of those "bookshelf technologies," ie you need to master a whole bookshelf of docs to get started. And I keep reading reports that say that CORBA will be done next year. That reeks of breakage to me. However, there are environments (I believe) where support for CORBA is part of the culture, and if possible we want to connect to those environments.
