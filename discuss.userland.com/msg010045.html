I was back in Freshman Drawing 101, when Prof Philipe would tell us to hold our drawing board so the paper faced the model, and scketch the figure without being able to look at what we were drawing.<p>

They all about the backend of the <a href='http://www.strathmore.com/'>Strathmore Papers</a> webite, which I designed and developed. The Strathmore website was designed by myself and another designer here, Karlheinz Schempp.<p>

The log graphs may not be available to the public forever, but for right now they are... and I can't see harm in them being there.
