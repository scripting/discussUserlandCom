I think a solution would be to stick another com object inbetween the frontier iis dll and frontier.  Your dll would create an instance of the new type, and that object would talk to Frontier via COM.  It should be possible for your intermediate object to talk to Frontier while it's UI is up.<p>

It would check it Frontier is running.  If it wasn't it would launch it, rather than instancing right away, so that the UI would be visible.  If Frontier was running, it would just connect right away.<p>
