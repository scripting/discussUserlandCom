But if I had a special deal with them that they are untouchable, beyond reproach, never to be criticized for fear of being excluded, I would have to disclose that. So far I've sold out to no one, what you hear on Scripting News is really what I think. I would also ask Dan Gillmor the same question. The integrity issues are real, and Dan is an expert on this. I believe he does have a discussion group. And I got an email from David Stutz at Microsoft saying that he wants to hear what I think, he's also a regular SN reader, and came to the Seattle dinner. He's part of our community. So is Ray Ozzie, the author of Notes, who I have known for a long time. I have tremendous respect for his work, and am totally dying to know what he was doing at that meeting.
