Why would these programs be *breaking* on 9/9/99?<p>

Presumably, they would have broken when, or soon after, the date 9/9/99 was used in regular operations. Thus there would have been stories of failures for the last several weeks or months.<p>

After all, the data being processed isn't changing today. If there are any 9/9/99 values in there, they've been in there for a while.<p>

The only reason for software to break *today* would be if it was calling a date function to get the current date and for whatever reason deciding that a current date of 9/9/99 was invalid. That doesn't hardly seem likely.
