I think I'm seeing that Frontier does the object packaging if you're going to be sending around tables and such. I'm wondering, (and am I just missing something?) if there is a way to encode tables as some xml format, then only serialize binaries, i.e. images?<p>

I'm asking because it's be cool if I could send a table from frontier to a perl script, and have the Perl script turn it into a hash, and make it all available to do whatever with it.<p>

It's possible I've missed something very basic about the XML-RPC machanism, or didn't really grok Ken MacLeod's Frontier::XMLRPC documentation...<p>

Anyone have any ideas/pointers?<p>
