Also, your Gnome example is a good one.. unfortunately, it is not grounded in reality.<p>

<i>Consider Gnome, for example--the first time Miguel de Icaza sat down in front of a Windows 95 machine, he realized just how much work Microsoft had put into their desktop and component architecture. So he started the Gnome project..</i><p>

Actually, no.  Miguel actually started out as a KDE developer and was pretty enthused about working with Qt et al.  This was <i>very</i> early on (several years ago).  At about this time, though, he had talks with both RedHat and rms that convinced him that the Qt license would ruin the purity of Linux.  He then started Gnome as an alternative.  Gnome was never originally a response to Win95 -- it was an anti-KDE.<p>

Of course, Miguel has done a great job with Gnome and it is now a polished product in its own right.
