On the other hand, he staunchly defends the intent behind the GPL: that GPL'd software, once set free, stays free.  If a project chooses to use the GPL on their project, and a third party violates the terms of the GPL, people will notice.  Often what happens is Stallman and the FSF will work behind the scenes to clear both the third party and the GPL.  If someone makes a claim to be compatible with GPL, he or his team will check on it and make sure.<p><p>

This is just as much about people choosing the GPL because it comes with terms they are comfortable with, as it is anyone else choosing any other license because they are comfortable with it.<p><p>

In case it wasn't clear, Guido and the Python troupe are looking to dual-license Python, with the Python license <i>and</i> the GPL.  <i>Because</i> they believe in the license in the GPL.  The GPL makes it clear that the parts developed and contributed to under the GPL will always be open and free as long as the third party using the code still claims to distribute the code under the GPL (which people will keep an eye on).  At any time, a third part can chose to drop the GPL (as is made clear in dual-licensing), and ship without GPL.  The product will then possibly continue to be OpenSource (the Py license is certified), but clearly not be supporting the ideas behind the GPL.<p><p>

There's no bogeyman here, that's the kool-aid talking.
