In other words if you want to redirect from <a href="http://www.site1.com/Directory1">http://www.site1.com/Directory1</a> to <a href="http://www.site2.com/Directory2">http://www.site2.com/Directory2</a>, it would be nice to click on Directory1, and type "http://www.site2.com/Directory2" in the text box for the redirect, and all files in that folder would be redirected to corresponding files in Directory2. Doesn't work that way. It just directs to the URL you typed, and if it's a directory and you don't have directory browse access you get an error. So this would be useful for redirecting to a "site has moved" type page, not much else. If there's a way to make this work I'd like to see it.<p>

The quick hack would just be to put: 
response.redirect "newlocation.htm"
in place of (or at the top of) each page to send the redirect header. Just a little tedious if there are lots of files.
