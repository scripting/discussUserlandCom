The reason I say this, is that after reading Oliver's MacOSX article and several programming manuals (all of which were written by men), I find it somewhat puzzling why people are substituting he/she or s/he for she.<p>

Firstly, please note:  I am in **no way** having a go at Oliver; just using the article as an example.<p>

The most logical method of not offending anyone is to say - they.<p>

For example, a sentence in the third block of Oliver's article:(I hope you don't mind me quoting you Oliver)<p>

'Macintosh Programmers understand that the User wants to get a job done that she already knows how to do.'<p>

would be better written:<p>

'Macintosh Programmers understand that the User wants to get a job done that **they** already know how to do.'<p>

Although this is not correct grammatically, it makes no assumption as to sex.<p>

The writing of 'she' instead of 's/he' or 'he/she' is the just as incorrect as writing he for everything as the gender assumption is still present.<p>

In fact, my writing the word 'gender' is also incorrect because only nouns have gender.  Creatures have sex.  (Thankfully).<p>

Just my tuppenyworth.<p>

Regards to all,<p>
