I always encourage people to post public messages, but sometimes that doesn't work for them, so I'll post summaries of the messages on the DG when I can so others can be in the loop and comment. Today there are two ideas that I want to open up:<ul><p>

<li>Multiple requests per HTTP message. For an image processing app, a client wants to batch up 100 processing operations, ship them to the server and get back 100 responses. <p>

<li>Leaving out the type info for elements of an array. In this application, an array contains 10000 elements. The overhead of <int>89</int> when multiplied by 10000 is non-trivial. 
</ul><p>

In the first request, it's tricky, I'm not sure how to format it, but the request seems reasonable.<p>

For the second request, I'd suggest sending an array of <string>s where you can omit the type tag, values that have no type default to string. Further, I think routers and modems do enough compression to not make this an issue, however there has been some private discussion that maybe XML-RPC should suggest that only four types be commonly supported, <string>, <base64>, <struct> and <array> and that all other types be expressed as <string>. I find this very appealing, most of our apps only use these four types and the ones that don't could easily be converted to do so.<p>

Thoughts?</li></li>
