<b>Strong opinion follows...</b><p>

I'm really getting tired of NSI's antics!  I wish the government would just step in and say bzzt!  Sorry NSI you've blown it.  You're outta here!  We're taking it back because we are tired of all the jack!<p>

I've gotten some of this SPAM from NSI and I don't like it!  They have an obligation to send me vital information in regards to my domain but not marketing hype!<p>

Almost every interaction with NSI is unproductive, combative and ultimately destructive.  It's like they know they are losing and are desperately trying to maintain a hold with any nasty tactic or scurrilous ploy they can come up with.  Don't the people who run NSI realize that these very behaviors drive us further away from them?
