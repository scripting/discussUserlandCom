Since there was no year zero in our calendar, the first millenium is from AD 1 through AD 1000, and the second is form AD 1001 through AD 2000. Given this, shouldn't we aim to pick a Person of the Millenium around Thanksgiving, 2000?<p>

Not that this is likely to change our selection much, but I'm a stickler for details.<p>
