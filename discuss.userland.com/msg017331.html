OpenBSD also duplicates a lot of work to find these holes ahead of time. Basicly they are correcting the laziness or inattention of the original programmer. Often by the time they DO fix these problems, the original author has based a whole new slew of features on the old buggy code, which then have to be fixed. :-) This results in OpenBSD using some fairly old software, though it is rock solid software.</I><p>

This is inevitable when your security model is based on plugging holes after someone has found the holes. To avoid this, you'd have to be based on a very different security model.
