Today on <a href="http://radio.userland.com/upgrade.html">the Radio UserLand Upgrade page</a> I read the following:<p>

<i>An off-by-one scrollbar bug has been fixed. The scrollbar would indicate that there was one more item in a table or outline than there actually was.<p>

Another scrollbar bug fixed: sometimes scrollbars were not disabled when they should be disabled.</i><p>

Credit where credit is due, I say, so once again it's hats off to the team at UserLand. I'm assuming that this fix will be rolled into Frontier too. Excellent!
