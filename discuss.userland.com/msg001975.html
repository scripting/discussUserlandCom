He said throw away the OS, but he did not say throw away the OS API.  As developers our view of the OS is the API we use to control that OS.  <p>

Microsoft does this with Win32.  Win32 is the API to the OS, but the OS may be WinCE, Win95, or WinNT.<p>

This is the point of Carbon.  The new OS will be Mach, but the API will be (mostly) the same.  As a developer, nothing (mostly) changes, but the user experience will (hopefully be) faster and more stable.<p>

So, buy all means throw away the OS!<p>
