              Perhaps you could relocate to New Zealand, where you could try to chat up the hordes of Hollywood types.

Unfortunately VCs don't live here either.<p>

I don't think the lack of VCs in Australia is because of capital gains tax.  NZ has no cap gains tax but doesn't have venture capital.  The us does have capital gains tax but has venture capital.<p>

It's more likely to be a simple population thing.  NZ and Aussie together are pretty small.  The Bay Area isn't that much bigger in population than NZ but it's like a filter for the entire US population -- if not the entire world population.
