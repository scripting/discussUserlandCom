Hope they're a help and not a hindrance.<p>

1. I just noticed by going to my.userland com that my NahenaheNet channel was gone. I hadn't checked on its status in a while, so called the RSS script and got an empty document. Would it be possible to build some email notification into the my.userland.com so that that the admin would be notified of any problems? My.Netscape does this, and though I have gotten occasional notes from them when my RSS file has had problems, I have not gotten any recently.<p>

2. I found the problem with my RSS generation. I like to have my links bold, and found early on that the <B&gt;</B&gt; tags had to be placed outside the <A "http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/href"></A&gt; to work, otherwise I'd get an empty document when the RSS script was called. I checked my page HTML and did have all my <B&gt;s outside the A HREFs, however, one used a upper case B instead of a lower case b. This seemed to cause the failure of the RSS script. When I made the bold tags lower case the server generated the RSS file fine.<p>

Not a major problem, but thought others might run across the same situation, and though it strange that this would break the RSS script even though the bold tags were outside of the A HREF.<p>

Aloha, <p>

PS - Mahalo for getting the code out, and support your plans for the distribution network. What a great service.</b></a>
