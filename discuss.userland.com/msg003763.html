They always want to persuade you to invest in a homegenous enviroment on the log run. The market and the pricing politics are seperated by the OSes not by the applications! People change apps more frequently than their OS."<p>

In fact they do exist, you can bridge from NT to software running on Unix. Microsoft may not encourage it, yet, but the protocol is there. <p>

Re your other issues, as we develop Frontier I think you'll see that what we're doing makes sense, even including the experiences you've had trying to sell Frontier into an ISP environment. I wouldn't recommend it today for an ISP either. However that statement may not be true forever, but it is true right now. <p>

The thing to remember about us (and every other developer) is that we move and grow. The limits you saw in the past, and those you see today, may not be what you see in the future. <p>

The idea that you need identical software running on each platform is against our religion. We believe in open interfaces and plug-innable software. As our strengths develop, running on Mac and Windows is going to be a big win. And connecting with Unix servers, even if Frontier is running on Unix, is central to our strategy.<p>

Further, I like Unix! I grew up on Unix. It's amazing to me how little it's changed. <p>
