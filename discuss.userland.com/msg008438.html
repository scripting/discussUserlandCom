(I'm not the one who originally started this thread.  I'll leave it up to the original poster to answer whether what Dave proposed is acceptable to him.)<p>

And for those who are also lost in Amazon.com's one-million-and-one-options-front-page, here's how you can change your e-mail address.<p>

1. From Amazon.com's front page, click on the "Your Account" graphics on the top right.<p>

2. Key in your current password, after selecting Secure or Standard server.<p>

3. Under "Account Settings" section, click on "Change the e-mail address or password".<p>

You can now key in your new e-mail address and, optionally, a new password.  After this, you can log-in using the new e-mail address.  You do not have to log in using the original e-mail address.<p>

Your preferences, including any credit card numbers, are not removed just because you change your e-mail address.<p>

Userland's system is, obviously, different from Amazon.com's.  Whether the inconvience (if any) for the user is worth the additional security (if any), I don't know, and I won't comment. :-)<p>
