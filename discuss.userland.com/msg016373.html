I'm managing a website about Normandy which is hosted in Mountain View for convenient reason. If one my contributors made an false assertion on the websites, publish racism sentences, the french justice could condamn me for hosting this kind of words, even if the author is known.<p>

It's very dangerous to host some data here !<p>

This week, a french association (LICRA) which is usually involved in good fights against racism have made a silly thing this week. There have made an action in justice against Yahoo! US about the auction site which is hosting auctions for Nazi objects.<p>

The advocate said on the air, that the next fight will be against the ISP which permits access to this kind of stuff.<p>

We're trying at the european level to do a law to make the host not responsible for the content, but just the authors.<p>

We don't have the first amendment in Europe and the free speech is a very different thing from US.
