I don't know, Dave...I think this is borderline privacy invasion. It's interesting, but in a voyeuristic kind of way. Like publishing someone's bookmarks. Sure, some people put their bookmarks on the net, but most don't.<p>

I'm not offended myself (my favorites pretty much mirror my Community links) but I think some folks would be. Maybe I missed an agreement or disclaimer along the way somewhere.<p>
