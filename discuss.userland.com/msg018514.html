They're worth more than a quarter.<p>

It seems to me, however, that even a quarter is orders of magnitude more money than artists are receiving on a per-song basis now.<p>

The problem with getting into the "What are songs worth" discussion is that there's no objective measure.<p>

On of the songs that means the most to me is <a href="http://www.jonimitchell.com/WildThings82LyricsHome.html">"Love"</a> by Joni Mitchell.  It was played at my wedding.  I now own two copies of it; one on vinyl I bought years ago, and one on the CD version of the same album.  I've spent about a dollar on those two copies of that song [about $23-24 for the media, 11 tracks each time].  I don't imagine Joni's seen very much of that dollar.  If I sent her a quarter for it right now, that quarter would probably amount to nearly a quarter more than she has gotten from me personally thus far.  If I had to put a dollar value on that one song I'd probably peg it at $20 or more.<p>

However, there are lots and lots of other songs that I enjoy that aren't worth very much in monetary terms to me personally.  "Mambo #5", for instance.  If I had to pay Lou Begas $3.00 to have a "licensed copy" of that song, I won't do it.  No offense intended to Lou, who is a talented and hard-working musician, I'm sure, with a catchy song.  It's just not worth that much to me.  I'd gladly give him up to a buck for an MP3 of it, though.  A buck would be pretty close to the ceiling for me for an arbitrary song of no particular personal meaning.<p>

So, before we get bogged down in a "what are songs worth?" argument over some specific number, how about if the model is a button that says "Send some money to the artist", with a minimal floor of <i>n</i> [$.25?  $.50? $1.00?] and no ceiling in $.25 increments.  Fill in whatever the song is worth to you.
