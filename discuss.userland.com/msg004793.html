It is:
tell application "Claris Emailer"
	set sigtext to contents of signature 1
end tell<p>

I've been pounding on this all morning trying to translate it into UserTalk, but can't seem to build the object in such a way that Emailer likes the apple event. I know I could have a script in AppleScript that would return that, but I'm embedding it in a bunch of other UserTalk, and it seems like the kind of thing that should be pretty strightforward if only I can get my brain wrapped around it.<p>

(I have a ton of quotations in Emailer as signatures. I'm trying to pull them all out and massage them into a web-page)<p>

Help?<p>

p.s. The version that's built using the AppleScript is at <a href="http://www.best.com/~davep/quotes.html">http://www.best.com/~davep/quotes.html</a>
