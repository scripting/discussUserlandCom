The first templating system I did was <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1994/11/07/davesautomatedwebster">in 1994</a>. In early 1995 <a href="http://www.scripting.com/autoWebDocs/whatisautoweb_119.html">AutoWeb</a> did <i>not</i> do templates. Now I'm going to check Clay Basket (also in 1995, I think).<br><br><a href="http://www.scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html">Clay Basket</a>: "Templates for page layout give the designer total control over the appearance of each page. Text editing is easy for writers." That was October 1995. In spring 1996 we started on Frontier's website framework, which is still supported. (It's at the core of Manila.)<br><br><a href="http://www.scripting.com/mp3s/weatherReportSuite.mp3"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/sound.gif" height="11" width="10" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></a>Tonight's song: <a href="http://www.getlyrics.com/lyrics/grateful-dead/wake-of-the-flood/07.htm">Weather Report Suite</a>.

Last night I installed RedHat 7. This morning, while mucking about the config files, I came across the one for RedHat's new auto-update tool. It queries a server at RedHat for a list of new updates available for your box, and you choose whether or not to install the updates. Anyway, it looks like that new service relies upon XMLRPC."<br><br>Dave Warner: "Re Red Hat's implementation, I checked it out as part of the research for my last article. The client portion looks fine, in line with your spec. The only enhancement I saw was the addition of SSL capabilities." <i>Fan-tas-tic!</i><br><br><a href="http://newsfeeds.manilasites.com/">Jeff Barr started</a> a Manila site to highlight XML newsfeeds he discovers. Good idea. Discovery can be overwhelming. Too many channels, it can be hard to find the good ones. We need curators and critics, people who appreciate a good channel. Let's also learn what makes a channel good. What's your favorite and why? As the tools get better we'll be asking these kinds of questions.<br><br>AP: <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20010122/sp/bbn_obit_agee_3.html">Tommy Agee dead at 58</a>. <i>Ouch.</i><br><br>NY Times: <a href="http://partners.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Prison-Escape.html?Partner=UserLand&RefId=ly_WLmY_WEFnnunuFF">Texas escapees arrested in Colorado</a>.<br><br><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/p/ap/20010120/us/inaugural_balls_1do.html">Katherine Harris</a> <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/p/ap/20010120/us/inaugural_balls_bsz.html">attended</a> the Florida inauguration ball on Saturday night. <br><br>ZDNet: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0,4164,2676785,00.html">IBM Touts Napster-proof Music Locks</a>.<br><br><b>P2P2P2P2P..<a name="p2p2p2p2p">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/xxx#p2p2p2p2p" title="Permanent link to 'P2P2P2P2P..' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0" alt="Permanent link to 'P2P2P2P2P..' in archives."></a></b><br><br>	It's official.

He's also proposing a tax cut. So why can't we take the money we'll get in the tax cut and spend it on family planning overseas? Just curious where the leverage is in having the government spend the money for us. <br><br>	BTW, in case I haven't said it before clearly enough I am strongly pro-choice. I think there are far too many people on the planet already, and if people want to have fewer children I totally support that. However, the moral issue is real. I hate the idea of killing unborn children. I don't see where the line is though. But I also think that fewer children is much better than more children. Not that I don't like children. Oy see the circle?<br><br>
