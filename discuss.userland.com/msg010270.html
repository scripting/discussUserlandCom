Okay.. two points here:<p>

o The L2 cache is indeed bigger in the PII/PIII than Celeron (128 to 512, I think).  When does this actually matter, though?  In most comparisons I've seen, the cache has had <i>no</i> effect on the outcome?  The fact that the higher-end processors have more seem to indicate that there is some use somewhere.  Well.. where?<p>

o Upgrading Celerons to PII/PIII is indeed more difficult as they are Slot 1 and Celerons are (now) Socket370.  Will this ever matter, though?  First, if Celerons are so much better value, why would you <i>want</i> to upgrade?  Secondly, the cost of a motherboard isn't very much compared to the cost of a processor.  If I'm going to upgrade to a PIII, an extra $100 for a motherboard isn't going to sway me...
