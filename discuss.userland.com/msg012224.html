You might want to try taking string.nthword(req, 2) instead. This gives you the requested path, which is usually what one is interested in.<p>

The danger is that by looking at the *whole* request, one may get a false positive. For instance, if the referrer page contains ".html" (which is extremely likely), the preprocessor will reject the request on that basis, which is not the desired behavior.
