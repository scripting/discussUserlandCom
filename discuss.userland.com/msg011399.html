Why <b>don't</b> more sites have publicised APIs?<p>

xmlTree has a XML interface to the complete directory - see <a href="http://www.xmltree.com/export/container.cfm">http://www.xmltree.com/export/container.cfm</a>.  We're using this to allow other sites, like MyWebNews, to offer a channel directory to their users.<p>

We'll also be building a specific directory of SOAP interfaces, using the same XML api, called soapi.com :-)<p>

You can look for more sites that have XML APIs in xmlTree, by filtering for applications or static content (i.e. not news, weblogs or forums).<p>

Try <a href="http://www.xmltree.com/Index.cfm?L=0&Cat=A&SeeThru=1">http://www.xmltree.com/Index.cfm?L=0&Cat=A&SeeThru=1</a> for applications or <a href="http://www.xmltree.com/Index.cfm?L=0&Cat=S&SeeThru=1">http://www.xmltree.com/Index.cfm?L=0&Cat=S&SeeThru=1</a> for static content.<p>

Do you have any more details of the Pyra api?  And when you talk about the XML api of Weavelet.com, do you mean the 'XML view'?  To be honest, I don't think that Weavelet.com offers anything more than MyWebNews or StartsHere at the moment.<p>
