In the transition period, it's tough to know what to keep, what to throw away.  I'm 6 months back in the US now, and I wonder if my fascination with Japan is holding me back from exploring new things here.

Frankly, I'd like to hang on to my Japan experiences as much as I can--4 years is a long time to work on understanding something, and I'd like to do it better than I can now.  I think I'm gonna call for that Japanese class right now...
