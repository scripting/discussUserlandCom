It builds on Active Scripting, which is sort of like OSA for Windows -- it allows for multiple languages.<p>

It builds on COM -- COM is sort of like Apple events, but more object-oriented. Scripts communicate with other applications and components by instantiating COM objects. Since Frontier is a COM server, you can write a VBScript script that calls into Frontier, for instance.<p>

It's also like the Scriptable Finder -- it adds new COM objects for scripting the Windows shell and file system.<p>

Here's how to work with WSH in Frontier:<p>

You can call VBScript, JScript, and PerlScript scripts from within Frontier.
