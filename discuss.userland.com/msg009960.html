Ever wonder why no one else uses Perl's regex engine, instead always writing a brand-new engine with the same syntax?  (For example, there's a Perl-like regex engine inside Mozilla, there's a C library called PCRE, and Tcl 8.x uses  a new regex engine from Henry Spencer.)  A while back I pored over at the code in Perl's regexec.c and regcomp.c, and while it's presumably comprehensible to someone, comments are rare and not very helpful; much easier just to write a new engine...<p>

This property even made it into the Jargon File's definition of
"joe code": <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/joe-code.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/joe-code.html</a>
Recent versions of Perl don't seem to be improving matters.
