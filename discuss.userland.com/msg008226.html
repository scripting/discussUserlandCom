Has anyone considered expanding the XML-RPC spec to support 
multipart mime?<p>

Motivation:<p>

Sometimes it is necessary to send or receive something large
and sufficiently XML-ish that it won't fit inline into XML.
Base64 encoding is an option.  However, it is an extra step
on both the client and the server that is not required by the underlying protocol.  In addition, XML-RPC is based on HTTP 
POST and POSTing multi-part mime files is a widely accepted
practise.<p>

It occurs to me that an extension to XML-RPC would save
implementors from having to base64 large objects (like, say,
a MPEG movie).  Instead one could allow multi-part mime with
the first part being XML-RPC and the parameters or response
containing an XLink to the subsequent mime parts.<p>

Any thoughts?
