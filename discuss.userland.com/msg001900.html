These are not the typical Mac crashes--couldn't even get a debugging window afterwards. One of my co-workers soon had the same problem.<p>

After some collective speculation, we think it may be related to Frontier's menu-sharing, as the crashes only occur when we have Frontier running (but that's almost all the time!).<p>

Anyone else experiencing the same problem? Similar ones?<p>

(We're running MacOS System 8.1 and Frontier 5.1.5.)
