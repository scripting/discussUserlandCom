Hey, that's what we're doing.  We even shipped two versions
on the same day! (CNRI 1.6 and BeOpen 2.0b1)<p>

Oh, we can ignore them.  What annoys me is people who don't
understand that if someone cries over something, it doesn't
necessarily mean he's the good guy, and that everyone else
should stop doing what they're doing just to make him happy.<p>

Things just don't work that way in real life.
