I don&#180;t. I think his brilliance makes him even more dangerous. I can only measure him by what I know about his company which is probably quite unfair, but if you are brilliant, it is easy to exploit people who are not as clever and don&#180;t see it coming.<p>

The fact is, few people are actually able to see how bad Word and Excel really are, because few people know how much better it could be. Of course, a lot of people don&#180;t need better software because they are managed by Dilbert&#180;s boss and do stupid things all day anyways.<p>

I am using Manila to author web pages because it is much smarter than Frontpage although it has much less features.<p>

I don&#180;t believe that technology solves all problems, but at least it should not cause new ones. I think this should be top priority when developing software.<p>

Cheers,<p>
