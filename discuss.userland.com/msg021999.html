The Florida election was a tie. I want this michegas to be over, there's nothing left to learn. I'm tired of the disrespect the politicians of both parties show for our intelligence. I hold Lieberman in esp low regard because he's a Jew and should know better (I'm Jewish myself) and because he was supposed to bring honor to the Democrat ticket. Lieberman says he wants all votes to count. His actions indicate otherwise. Shame on him, shame on every adult who lies at a time like this. Lieberman should have a talk with his rabbi.<br><br><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/mets.gif" height="93" width="94" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">I remind you all that I accept defeat. <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/10/26">I rode the 7 train</a> with Yankees fans who gloated while Mets fans were in tears.

Having a logo of course is not the same thing as having the site ready to roll out. We're doing this site to put a friendly face on the directory structures created "behind the scenes" by Scripting News people. Others can build directory portals in any other scripting environment running on the Web, or even in a P2P way, in software running on the user's desktop machine. All you have to do is figure out OPML and inclusion. It's interesting computer science, not super-hard programming, a good two-weekend project for a scripter who knows PHP or Zope or Cold Fusion, or whatever you like. I like Frontier, so that's why I wrote it there, first.<br><br>Doc's friend Craig Burton talks about the Internet as a donut. It's got stuff at the edges and is hollow in the middle. I know we're writing ourselves out of exclusivity in OPML's future by evangelizing it to tools developers and server people. I'm betting that our authoring tools and server stuff will do well with competition. A rising tide raises all ships. Ask not what the Internet can do for you, etc.<br><br>Other new stuff in the pipe. We're starting a site for "Python" scripts that do interesting things with "SOAP" and "XML-RPC". The next-generation EditThisPage.Com should come online next week, probably tomorrow. "Piking Behind Firewalls," with new code for both Manila and Radio, is almost ready to go. It allows the Radio outliner to write stories, do weblogs and directories for Manila sites, even if they're behind one of those nasty dreaded firewalls.<br><br><a href="http://inessential.com/2000/11/25.html">Brent</a> found sample code for a <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-1997/jw-01-step.html">Java outline displayer</a>.
