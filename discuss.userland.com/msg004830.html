If my phone company is true to their word, I'll be running a server on my G3 powermac over ADSL within the next month.  I'm hoping to try out most of the new Nirvana features.  When I scrounge up the cash I'll buy another powermac, but in the mean time the server will also be used to run Photoshop, QuickTime VR Authoring Studio, and possibly GoLive.<p>

I will try to reboot once a week, and only run the additional apps I need, when I need them.  I'll do backups daily.  I'll trim down the extensions too.  I'll stop playing Myth (this will be tough, given the potential speed of the ADSL connection).<p>

Does anyone have any experience with this?  Is it a <I>Bad Idea</I>, or can I get by this way?  Any tips, or amendments to the advice in the page cited above?<p>

PS: I was going to abbreviate it to 'hp/x server' in the subject line, but that's too close to another computer acronym I've seen somewhere.</i>  This is such a great phrase that it just cries out for a jargony name.
