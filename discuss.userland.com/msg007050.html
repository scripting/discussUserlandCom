<li>More frequent updating of channels. Now it will attempt to read each channel once every hour. If any characters changed in the file, it will show up in the <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewUpdatedChannels">Recently Updated Channels</a> list, which rolls over every night at midnight.<p>

This creates a new way to follow channels. I want to know when there's new stuff. This helps me get familiar with the channels in a new way. I hope other people tune into this view, consider bookmarking the page and visiting it for a week, just to see how it flows. I think this is esp important if you're running one of the sites. <p>

<li>Did a lot of work on error reporting. You can now quickly see the XML text for each of the sites as they were loaded. If it's a well-formedness error, the location is highlighted with <a href="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/xmlerrormessage.gif">three red asterisks</a>. If there's a semantic error, the message is displayed along with a pretty-printed version. Often this creates the bizarre effect of wrapping XML tags around an HTML error page. If it's obvious that a site has moved, I'll just delete the service from the service list.<p>

<li>Channel ID collisions. There were two sets of duplicates in the services table, one of them involved <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$8">Scripting News</a> and the other involved <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$18">Motley Fool</a>. In cleaning this up, I couldn't figure out which was the real Fool file. So if Mark Kennedy could take a look and if it's not, let me know.<p>

<li>We now show the date and time of last update for all channels. It will take a while for this to percolate, the HTML is re-generated only when it changes. (I may write a script that forces all channels to be reloaded, once.)<p>

<li>The <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$40">viewChannel</a> page now shows more information about the channel.
</ul></li></li></li></li><p>

<b>Goal</b><p>

The goal for this round of changes was to get a handle on what's going on here, and develop tools to learn more about what's going on. It's exciting to see the sites flow. It's becoming more realtime. Yeah!<p>
