Window-dressing an interface *does* attact people and encourage them to use it. It also helps attract VCs. It's more important than it should be.</i><p>

I think its overlooked more often than it should be. The way data is displayed can really enhance its impact. (Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392126/o/qid=937593850/sr=8-1/002-2875092-7837048">Visual Explanations</a> by Edward Tufte)<p>

Edgar is visually stunning, but the interface is also overly complex. The toy / play factor is getting in the way of its function, and thats bad.<p>

Kudos to Danny Goodman for pushing the technical envelope though.
