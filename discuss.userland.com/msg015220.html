Imagine posting a story, then allowing via xsl-t for it to automatically be converted into rss, svg, and plaintext.
Yes, I know you could create specific scripts for each one, but why not instead create a script that does xsl-t which would enable infinite translations of tagged languages?<p>

Egad, and what if that xsl-t support were available via xml-rpc? My mind boggles at the thought of sending an xml file to an xsl-t service, via xml-rpc and getting the translated document back via xml-rpc!  Ack!
