However, the neatest ones <<a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tree$3.2.12">http://frontier.userland.com/tree$3.2.12</a>> and things like discussion groups seem to require running Frontier as a full-time web server or that you have a stand-alone server running Frontier in the background. If someone wanted to build a website using these features, they would have to get their own server or find an ISP who will run Frontier for them (does any ISP do this now?).<p>

Is Userland planning to develop features in Frontier to help ISPs support Frontier users? Or can ISPs have multiple people running Frontier apps on a single server? This is just a friendly question, but one that has been on my mind for a while.<p>
