I hadn't considered getting a Mac, although that's where I took off in computing.  We're a Windows shop, but our network admin seems open to the idea.  The question is whether I want to keep track of updates etc on another OS.  Tempting as it is, I'm not sure I have the energy...<p>

It's hard to justify Digital Video production, because in theory we have someone to do that (in theory because it's one of those departments which are a black hole of information and support).<p>

I'd love to get a chair, but it's not allowed - state regulations.<p>

A <i>really</i> nice monitor is something I hadn't considered, but is definitely attractive -- I spend a ton of time in front of mine.<p>

No software suggestions?  Server-side? Little stuff that makes your life easier?<p>

One idea I hadn't thought of (but that came to me last night) was a digital certificate for our server.  Not sure when I'll need it, but definitely might.  Any recommendations on where to get one?<p>

Thanks<p>
