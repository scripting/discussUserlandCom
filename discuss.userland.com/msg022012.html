Unfortunately the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/Talks/1206-xml2k-tbl/slide16-0.html">slide</a> on the killer app isn't there. Is that ironic?<br><br>I finally met Zeldman tonight, he doesn't look anything like his pictures. He says the same thing about me. He thought I had gray hair. (I don't, not yet.) I'll try to take some pictures tomorrow.<br><br>Oh geez. Look <a href="http://www.urbanev.com/jakob/">what they're doing</a> to Jakob Nielsen.<br><br><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/technology/archive/2000/12/07/p2p.dtl&type=printable">SF Gate</a>: "Expect the year 2000's version of the P2P revolution to go down the same way the 'push' revolution did: a victim of its own hype."<br><br>Newsweek reporter Deborah Branscum has a started a <a href="http://buzz.weblogs.com/">weblog</a>. The gloves are off. "Earth to execs: Your quotes are bullshit. You know it. We know it." <i>Welcome!</i><br><br>BTW, Deborah hit the Flip Home Page user interface wall in Manila. We have a <a href="http://manila.userland.com/stories/storyReader$102">Howto</a> that explains this, but it isn't getting in front of people at the right time. Gotta do some work here.<br><br>I went to a session on privacy by Simson Garfinkle. I wanted to hear him speak after admiring his writing for many years. He said something that rang a bell. People who use Yahoo feel like customers, but they're not customers. They're the product. The customers are the people who buy ads. He said this is a disconnect that's going to cause a lot of problems in the future. I agree. Also there's a general sense here that the party is over, now we have to run businesses and decide who our customers are and what our products are.<br><br>BusinessWeek: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf2000127_947.htm">Will Google's Purity Pay Off?</a> "Brin says Google makes about a penny per search in revenue. 'We do more than 20 million searches a day, so it works out to $80 million dollars a year,' he claims."<br><br>The conference is well-attended. The opening session with Jeremy Allaire was packed. Tomorrow I speak to both conferences simultaneously, Builder.Com and eDevCon, about SOAP and XML-RPC.<br><br>
