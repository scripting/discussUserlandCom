Now hold on there.  Why <i>isn't</i> it cheaper?  Even if you think that the cost of hiring UNIX experts is greater than the cost of NT licenses + NT experts (which IMO is debatable), it's certainly cheaper to put Linux on 500 boxes than, say, Solaris or another UNIX.<p>

If you disagree, please explain.
