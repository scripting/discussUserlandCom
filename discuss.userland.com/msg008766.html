I don't know much about IIS and I don't have the time to dig in. I have a technique that works independent of the server, but it's becoming clear that IIS doesn't have a way to just serve up the raw contents of a file. Either that, or people just don't know how to do it. If there are any Microsoft people here, this is a really convenient way to do redirection on a multi-OS LAN.
