But there are two things that make me not quite understand how it would work in Frontier.<p>

I've thought about it too, but didn't want to say anything until I had a sense of UserLand's feelings on the general idea.<p>

Since Frontier was not built from the ground up to do it, the solutions seem like kludges.<p>

The coder needs a way to tell Frontier that the given outline element is a "here document", maybe something similar to the way we convert an element to a comment. Then variable names will get substituted as is. The printf() function in C does this -- no special characters are needed to denote a variable name. This seems better than requiring a special syntax for variables. WinBatch uses that strategy -- you enclose your variable name in a pair of percent signs to signify substitution within a string. Messy. Most people use distinctive variable names anyway. When needed, a backslash or single quotes could be used to protect a token against substitution. <p>

Since the primary reason for doing this is to ease generation of HTML within script, any metacharacters that you actually want displayed could be entered in HTML entity format. <p>

I don't know what sort of performance hit this would entail. What about odb references? The script parser would have to evaluate these.<p>

You would want to be able to enter a line break that didn't produce a new outline entry (as the Return key does). Since shift-return is already taken (creates a comment), it would have to be a more complex. Ctrl-Shift-Return on Windows, is option-Return available on Mac?<p>

I admit, it all seems rather inelegant. Probably the source of Doug's reluctance!
