Go to the <a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$9">Changes Notes</a> page. Scroll to the bottom. See the cow skull? <p>

Basically I snookered all of you! You were critiquing it as if it were a website. Of course it looks like it is a website. But it's actually a DG.<p>

Now you can imagine that a bunch of the pages can be rendered statically. Voila! Scaling.
