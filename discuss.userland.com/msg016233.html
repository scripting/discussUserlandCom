This is not Dave's private matter. Userland is trying to launch an innovative ground breaking Internet product, Pike.<p>

It simply does not work -- dead in the water kind of "does not work" -- if there are downtimes when people try to use it.<p>

Dave, if you intend Pike to be used as a really remote writing tool, I do think you have to account for connectivity going away, in the tool itself. Instead of a POST NOW mechanism, have you considered a SCHEDULE CHANGES FOR POSTING kind of approach that keeps trying, and when the post happened successfully a confirmation box pops up?<p>

BTW, a spell checker would have caught "wreckless" here. Did you mean "reckless"? :)
