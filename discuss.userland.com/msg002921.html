The first thing the editor/submit script does is to check the hidden field last-modified date against the file last-modified date, and if the file is later, it returns an error to the user asking them to refresh their edit form.  If your home page edit form included this, it would prevent the errors you're talking about, although setting the Expires header is important, too.
