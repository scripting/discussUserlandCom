Many of them seem to be motivated by an urge for REFINEMENT and SIMPLIFICATION instead of endless addition of dubious features (which is driven by the competitive need to "stay in front"). So the first requirement of such an enterprise would be an underlying motivation which values refinement and simplification. This would preclude most commercial organisations, especially Microsoft, from being able to deliver such a browser.





I recently read a new book by Edward DeBono, titled "Simplicity", in which he says that simplicity will be something which is valued more and more in the future, as a requirement for dealing with an overly complex technological world. The current browsers are an example of something which has become too complicated in various ways (some examples are given in the responses on this list to this topic).















































But if the well-funded commercial players can't or won't create such a browser, then who can? And how would such a project be organised?
