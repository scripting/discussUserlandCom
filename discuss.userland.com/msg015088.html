If I want to point Express at my own Manila site/server... do those passwords get stored at Userland? Are they on my machine? Are they somehow associated with the cookie at my end?<p>

In short: how far can I trust this app? Can I run my own Express server on my Manila server?<p>

Lots of questions...<p>

Thanks,
