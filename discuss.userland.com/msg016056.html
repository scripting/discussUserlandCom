We have HTTP, HTML and XML under control in our environment. The next protocol to embrace is email. Then we need to get instant messaging. Why? Because we need all those elements to make our web writing system really hum. Groups of people working on websites need to send instant messages that get sorted into different bins. Sometimes you receive something via email that belongs on your website. Sounds complex perhaps, but consider this. We have a new tool in our kit. An easy to use outliner. It supports all the protocols that Frontier does. (In case you haven't figured it out, despite its writer-friendly interface, Pike has the Frontier engine embedded.)<br><br><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16061">I've asked</a> Microsoft to support XML-RPC in their implementation of SOAP, and they've given it a qualified thumbs up.

"If Microsoft is the only large vendor who supports SOAP, well I guess you will have lock-in. But that won't be Microsoft's fault, that will be Sun, IBM, Apple, Oracle, Red Hat, etc's doing. If they don't like Microsoft, they can support XML-RPC, which doesn't have their name on it. But both specs are open, I wouldn't allow my name to be on SOAP, as it is, if it weren't open." <i>Updated 8:06AM.</i><br><br>Lots of great links today on <a href="http://patents.editthispage.com/2000/04/10">patents.editthispage.com</a>.<br><br><a href="http://www.suck.com/daily/2000/04/10/daily.html">Suck</a>: "For Nagivator users, skins have become more than amusing little graphical diversions: They've become the death of the standard interface.
