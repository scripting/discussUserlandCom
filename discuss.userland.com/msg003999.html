After this trial run, Mac OS X will take over. Predicting Mac OS X Server will be off the price list in 2 years is a given; so will Mac OS 8.5.</blockquote><p>

FWIW, Apple has said that there <i>will</i> be future versions of MacOS X Server. Specifically, they seem to be planning that for every version of MacOS X (consumer) there will also be a server version. Claiming that all the features of MacOS X Server will be rolled into the regular MacOS X makes no sense to me; not every user needs AppleShare, WebObjects, etc. Furthermore, Apple can make lots of money on a separate Server OS (just like MS does on NT).<p>

Of course, since the base infrastructure will be the same, Apple will probably have a hard time selling MacOS X Server to people who just want to run Apache; they can just download it and it will give the same performance on MacOS X as on Server.
