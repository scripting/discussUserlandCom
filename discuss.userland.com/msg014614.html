Can we get a feature for doing the includes on the server instead of the client? Macro? &#123;includeAfile "http://domain.com/filename.htm"&#125;. <p>

A surprisingly large number of browsers have JavaScript turned off or are too old to support a current version. Moving content-includes to the server-side renderer speeds client side delivery (fewer http calls from the browser over slow connections). So we would have a faster, more available service. <p>

Downside: more traffic through your server. Upside: network caching should address much of that and you also get more accurate and complete service usage statistics.
