Is there a reason that an ITEM can't be arbitrary HTML?<p>

If there is a good reason, I'd like to see something like <a href="http://www.prefab.com/ssl/notagsmarkup.html">no-tags markup</a> supported instead, so that I can offer _italics_, *bold*, etc and the aggregator can convert these as desired.<p>

The other big controversy, I think, is whether aggregators who want headlines-only should get special support for this, and how.  In my <a href=http://www.robotwisdom.com/#main"">main</a> section I usually offer a short comment plus at least one pullquote, and if the pullquote is self-explanatory I don't worry about making the short comment self-explanatory too-- so in this case it's no good as a short headline.<p>

In theory, though, I could script things so I could write a second, self-explanatory headline too.  But I really don't want to have to maintain two files, and I don't want that auxilliary headline to be visible...?<p>

What I really want is to put ITEM tags around each item in my HTML file, and be done with it.
