Try upgrading Win98 to WinNT. That is what I set our to do last week. You can't if you have FAT32 installed. WinNT 4 doesn't recognise the format. <p>

It gets better. If you try to reformat the hard disk with Win98's format.exe, it automatically formats in FAT32 format. There is no command-line switch to format in FAT16. <p>

So we had to hunt for a Win95 bootup floppy with a Win95 format.exe before we could create the FAT16 partition.<p>

Surely M'soft can afford with their gazillions to spend some money making it easy for users to upgrade when using FAT32. <p>
