I use table.visit to walk though this structure and build my links
but it walks through the tables in "name" order. That is how they are sorted in the database. <p>

How can I get control of this order?
I can't change the order of the tables in the ODB
(its only name, value, kind). The only way i have found to manage 
the order in the database is to place a space infront of names that
i want to bubble to the top. This works ut looks awful.<p>

I don't think I can use an outline instead, because need to dynamically add more urls through a cgi to this table structure.<p>

If there are other sources for this kind of information I would really like to see it. I checked archives and the docs but am unable to make any progress.<p>

Thanks
Kevin
