I assume that their ASP-compatible runtime doesn't do the BSOD thing. Is that true? Luke?</i><p>

I don't know. <p>

I've been running NT systems for a few years now. They're very stable, but that depends on the software you run on the box. The only NT server which hangs with any regularity is the Domino box.<p>

My other NT boxes tend to be more or less as stable as my Linux boxen.<p>

I've never read anything bad about Chili!Soft. I'm in the process of putting together an NT box to run IIS, SQL Server 7, and ASP to do stress tests.
