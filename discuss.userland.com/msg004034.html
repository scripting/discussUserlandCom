I added a tiny feature to the imageRef macro to handle the state of a button (on or off) and renamed it buttonRef.  Here is the additional script (placed right under the DW/PBS comments):<p>

if defined (pagetable^.["#sectionid"]) &#123;<p>

	local (sectionid = pagetable^.["#sectionid"]);<p>

	if (imagespec == sectionid) &#123;<p>

		imagespec = "b_" + imagespec + "_on";<p>

		glossRef = ""}<p>

	else &#123;<p>

		imagespec = "b_" + imagespec + "_off"}}<p>

So if the page you are rendering has a #sectionid that is equal to the imagespec then it changes it to b_imagespec_on.  Otherwise it's b_imagespec_off.<p>

So within your template (or where ever) you make calls to the buttonRef and if the image you are calling has the same name as the sectionid it uses the _on version, otherwise it uses the _off version.  It also "shuts off" the glossRef (actually that's a bad idea).<p>

PS  I just switched jobs (yea!) from Tech Support to Graphic/Web Design (double yea!) and am now I on a Mac (uhm, yea...).  I remember when Dave first got on Windows people gave him a bunch of tips/pointers/links.  I'm looking for the same thing.<p>

PPS Macs are cool too.
