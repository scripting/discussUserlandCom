I didn't use the redirects when we were having connectivity problems.<p>

I don't want to degrade service, but I <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/report">learn</a> a lot from those redirects, it helps me know who's reading my site and what they're interested in.<p>

It's one of the most useful tools I have, so unless there are big problems, I'm going to keep using it.
