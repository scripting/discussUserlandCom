Also, I'd like to suggest a more robust password generator which always uses a mix of upper and lower case, and at least one number, and a length of at least N, where N is 8 or 12 or whatever. Also storing the password in the cookie encoded in some fashion. A lot of corporate security standards mandate this. Of course, if you want to convey that it is not a heavy duty security environment, maybe it would be better to drop the password altogether and use a memnonic phrase.
