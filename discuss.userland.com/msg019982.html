What the heck is their business plan? Okay, forgetting for the moment about that lawsuit--they have garnered lots of eyeballs, what are they going to do to "monetize" them? It seems to me, at the moment, that they are operating out of the Netscape playbook (atually, Netscape's playbook was better)--we have captured a huge audience by giving stuff away (other people's stuff in Napster's case, of course), now there has got to be economic value to us *somewhere* in there!<p>

<a href="http://www.mp3opinions.com/may26.htm">Hummer Winblad has invested $15 MM in them</a> and sits on the board, so there is probably something I'm missing, but I'd sure love for someone to spell it out for me.
