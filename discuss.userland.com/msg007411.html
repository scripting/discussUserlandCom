opinions nonetheless.<p>

I think what the latest "virus" shows us is that the most vulnerable
aspect of any system is the user who uses it.  We know that the best
password systems in use today fall apart when users give their passwords away over the phone when someone asks them for it.  <p>

We also know that people will execute any email attachment that is
sent to them if the email tells them to execute it and the sender 
is someone who is trusted.  This is one of the most insidious aspects 
of the latest type of email virus.  It appears that a trusted 
individual is asking you to execute this program.  Sure, we are wary
of such things, but is the average individual?  <p>

I remember long ago, before there were windows users with email
systems, an email virus of sorts was rampant on the internet.  Do you
remember Craig Shergold and his postcard writing campaign?  It's not
the same as today's email virus, but it's not a lot different either.<p>
