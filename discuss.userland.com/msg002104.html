No, I don't have a specific #fileExtension preference. Only the one in user.html.prefs, which is set to ".html".<p>

I just put a #fileExtension in the website and it still changed the glossary entry.<p>

I requested a wsf page and grabbed a copy of the pageTable passed to html.addPageToTable. There's a fileExtension of ".wsf".<p>

I did find a call to html.addPageToGlossary in the site's pageFilter. I don't really remember why I put that there. Am I "doubling up" on these calls?
