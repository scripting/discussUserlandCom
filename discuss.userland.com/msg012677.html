Cool. I just read the policy page. I understand the separation between the two discussion groups now. Thanks for showing me.<p>

I think the main reason why I confused both DG's as one is because when I perform a search for previous tech support postings at search.userland.com, the postings show up in the form of:
discuss.userland.com/msgReader$xx<p>


Since all of the past tech support answers (which have been very
good so far) are displayed in the discuss.userland.com domain, I 
thought that current tech support can be reached through the same
place.<p>

Maybe you can direct the new Frontier user to the proper place by
placing a message on the Search page:
"For current tech support, please post your questions to frontier.userland.com/discuss/"<p>
