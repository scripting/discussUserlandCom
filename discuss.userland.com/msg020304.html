I just did, and I think Miguel at
least recognises the usability problems with Unix.<p>


Further, the ease of installing an OS from scratch is not really an
issue.  How many W95 or Mac boxes have you bought that required you to
partition the disk, format it, etc.?  Probably none.  In the same way,
when <a href="http://www.penguincomputing.com/">Penguin Computing</a>
sends us a machine, they don't require us to have to install the OS.
Or consider the <a href
="http://www.scripting.com/weLoveOurQube.html">Qube</a> or <a href
="http://www.tivo.com/">TiVO</a>.  Both use Linux as the OS, but are
simple enough for the average user to use.<p>

I point this out
because I think it shows that Linux is not the issue.  It can be made
so that it is easy to use.  The company bundling the computer just has
to do it.<p>


That said, very few people are under the illusion that Linux is on par with W95 or the Mac when it comes to ease of use.  <a href=

sees the problems, as does esr:<p>
