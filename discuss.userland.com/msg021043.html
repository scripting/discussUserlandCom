Is it like COM on windows? COM allows use
of components in perl from python, or vbscript, etc. DOTNET allows
even inheriting a VB class from python. Its not scriting only
though..is OSA like that?<p>

But these are windows only.<p>

The mozilla project has written a cross platform COM like thingy
called XPCOM( cross platform COM). There are c++ and javascript
bindings presently. Sun is writing java bindings, and activestate
perl and python(first server, then client).<p>

At <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/decentralization/237"><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/decentralization/237">http://www.egroups.com/message/decentralization/237</a></a> I proposed using XPCOM in
a p2p system. But this discussion makes me want to ask, isnt this
a nice cross platform scripting solution, available on linux, mac
, windows, all other unix, beos, etc...<p>

The GPL is silent on dll's btw. Thats why the linux kernel allows
you to load in proprietary modules for drivers, though Linus discourages it for compatibility reasons...
