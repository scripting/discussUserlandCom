Will they be assisting work in creating free formats better then MP3?<p>

MP3 is a good format and there's a lot to like about it, but it's not the be-all end-all format.  MP3 sucks the life out of classical music, and a lot of other genres of music get hit pretty hard (jazz comes to mind) as well.  I'm not just talking "production values" here, something I agree is overrated, but the actual life of the music.  Is Napster, like the industry before it, only going to really <I>focus</I> on pop music, which, while often quite good, is <I>not</I> the totality of 'music'?<p>

The root problem is that an artist limited to the abilities of MP3 is going to be unnecessarily constained in expressive power.  I'm not a complete stranger to this, my hobby is composing, and my own music is hurt badly by converting it to MP3.  I suspect that will become a larger stumbling block if Napster tries to branch out beyond pop music into areas where MP3 becomes a much weaker format.<p>

(added later: Let me emphasize, MP3 is a good start, and I like it, and I vastly prefer it to nothing.  It just can't carry the whole revolution, that's all.)
