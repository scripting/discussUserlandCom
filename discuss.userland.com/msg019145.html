For better image enhancement/manipulation than GraphicConverter will give you, you can also pick up ColorIt! for next to nothing (c. $29?), or its big brother Enhance! for not too much more (c. $65?).<p>

I actually use Illustrator, Enhance!, and GraphicConverter for all my web graphics. I guess I'm in that (supposed) minority that has no version of PhotoShop at all.<p>
