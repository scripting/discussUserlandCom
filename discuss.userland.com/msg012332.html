Why do all frontier managed blogs look the same?  From a developer standpoint, this is interesting to me because it shows that even the average power user (someone who'd run their blog on their own server) is still mostly interested in the 'service' and not the 'API'.<p>

what's more, it shows that there is a need for more 'service' centric applications on the web. after all, why install frontier on a local machine if you are not going to customize it?<p>
