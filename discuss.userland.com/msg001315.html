High Crime was a term describing crime committed by a person in high office, not a "serious crime" which is how it is being taken today. And a misdemeanor is even lower than that.

By this argument, we should throw out a President for the high misdemeanors of jaywalking or spitting on the sidewalk. <p>

If impeachment were the only legal remedy for all trespasses by a high office holder, then these office holders wouldn't be subject to prosecution in federal, state, and local civil and criminal courts. <p>

I'm telling this second or third hand; I understand the Federalist papers and other documents the scholars use to interpret the founders' intent re the constitution specifically considered this. They reserve the most serious abuses of the office for impeachment/removal and all other abuses for remedy at election time or through the courts. <p>

Can I get a lawyer to chime in on this?
