Is it wrong to be proud of one's accomplishments within reason? How often do you see a software developer talk, sometimes positively, about competator's products?<p>

Sure. But he also let's others post their views (think Zope).<p>

>to promote frontiers power via this website and it's features. <BR>
Well, it is Dave's Web site after all.<p>

>selling software. <BR>
Hmm, I haven't heard too many sales pitches that were worthless and annoying.<p>

>money.<BR>
Ha. You're funny. Ignorant too it seems. You see, all of Daves big competators that I can think of start at around $30k.<p>

A wise man once taught me that you should not think more highly of yourself that you ought. To some, Dave's ideas are insightful and honest; to others, his comments might seem arrogant and egotistical. <p>

The fact that Dave makes an effort to share a part of his time and his ideas proves to me that he is motivated by something other than his own personal gain. You can argue that it's all just a part of his goal to become the SuperDave of the universe; but hey, that's fine with me because the benefits for the community are the same.<p>
