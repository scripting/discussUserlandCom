"Every NYer knows that when it begins to rain, it becomes easier to buy an umbrella and harder to hail a cab. As soon as the first few drops fall, people appear on the street selling cheap umbrellas, while a lucky few pedestrians jump in the few available cabs."<br><br><a href="http://www.internetworldnews.com/120100/12.01.00underdev.asp">Nate Zelnick</a>: "It makes far more sense to have a system in which sites—or resources of any kind—can report their own existence, along with changes that have been made since they were created." <br><br><a href="http://www.starterfluid.com/index.html">Starter Fluid</a> is an early-stage VC firm specializing in micro-investments. I'm going to find out more. To do <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/11/30/bootstrapping">bootstrapping</a> we need VC firms who are ready to make smallish bets on technology. <br><br><a href="http://www.trl.ibm.co.jp/projects/xml/soap/trlsoap/">IBM Japan shipped</a> a beta of a new SOAP implementation for Apache.<br><br><a href="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~cpbrown/savewrld.wav">Come Pinky</a>, we have work to do.<br><br><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/p/nm/20001202/pl/mdf136622.html"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/lottCowboyHatWithFeather.gif" height="35" width="50" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></a> Not to be outdone, <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/p/nm/20001202/pl/mdf136622.html">Bush met today</a> with congressional leaders Hastert and Lott, who's wearing a cowboy hat, imitating the style pioneered by Dubya himself. Lott's hat appears to have a feather. Interesting. I wonder what it means?<br><br>SJ Merc: <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/indepth/docs/layoff120200.htm">Dot-com layoff parties</a>.<br><br>Today is a Total Writing Day. My job is to write the top-level of Radio, to explain what it is and how it works. <br><br>1. <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/whyIsItCalledRadio">Why is it called Radio?</a><br><br>2. <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/itCommunicates">It communicates</a>.<br><br>3. <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/itsAnOutliner">It's an outliner</a>. <br><br>4. <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/howToUseTheOutliner">How to use the outliner</a>.<br><br>They'll also be in the <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/directory/3541/whatIsRadio">directory</a> for Radio, so when they scroll off the bottom of this page, people will still be able to find the articles. (To <a href="http://kishore.editthispage.com/2000/12/02">Kishore</a>, who wants Timeless Weblogs, this is how they work. Surely we can automate some or all of the work, but first, before doing that, I have to do it by hand, to understand the problem, and see where the opportunities to automate really help rather than hinder the process.)<br><br>BTW, if you're a Radio user and want to get your point of view on the record, please <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$3766">post a story</a> on the Radio site. I can use help, many perspectives are useful in pulling this together. <br><br><a href="http://design.weblogger.com/2000/12/01">Bryan Bell</a> did a tutorial for navigation structures in Manila without XML. For some designers XML is too over-the-top. <br><br><a href="http://soap.weblogs.com/stories/storyReader$159">Jake Savin</a> did a summary of the SOAP interface for Manila. If you've been waiting for a real SOAP-aware Web app, the wait is over. <br><br><a href="http://www.zeldman.com/glamorous/glamorous22.html">Zeldman</a> has a Glamorous Life.
