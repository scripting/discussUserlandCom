Actually, my thinking is that I'll probably end up maintaining a separate set of pages mostly manually. Since most of the links categorize well, but won't categorize well automagically (unless I add the category when I add the link, hmm... there's another way to attack the problem), I'll probably develop scripts so that when I add something to Dave's Picks, it gets added to a holding-area outline (along with the add date) and then I'll manually move things from that outline to the correct category (or categories).<p>

The big problem is that I'm still statically generating all my pages and ftping 'em up to the server, so putting in a search engine isn't really something I can do today.<p>
