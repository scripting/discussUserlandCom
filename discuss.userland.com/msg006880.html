Manilla sounds intriguing, a natural outgrowth of the web as a medium. I'm familiar with Terry Morse's Myrmidon which adds an HTML renderer to the Chooser in the MacOS, which sounds like part of what Manilla is expected to offer. Choose "Print" and you get an HTML file. Will Manilla offer transparent uploads to the server as well? Overcoming that barrier will really open the web up to a lot of folks who are intimidated by ftp and that sort of thing.<p>
