Dave,  Thank you for saying that so well!  I am certain you are right on this one.  However, I think Microsoft profits from the confusion.  I have tried to explain this to people for 4-5 years and they just look at me and say, "but, what choice do we have".  More than anything I can think of, I want to be part of a solution to this mess, a recovery from the Monopoly Decades.  We can do better, but I can't figure out how to get people thinking that WE DO HAVE CHOICES.  You tha Man Dave!  dws.
