It's fine by me for them to retain the copyright so that they can protect their dead tree business model. But for me the key issue is access, free access for the virtual format via the web. Your comments strengthen my gut intuition that the pie grows bigger for everyone if they put up the content for free access on the web. And if you make it possible for people to add to the knowledge expressed in the original text, poof! Unimaginable possibilities open up.
