SIF is a framework for sharing of school-related data among administrative applications.  Under the hood, it's XML, with its own DTD. It defines Student, Contact, Teacher, and School objects, a bunch of messages and events (eg ENROLLMENT CHANGE, STUDENT UPDATE) and two "application interaction modes": QUERY/RESPONSE, PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE.<p>

It's all there in the spec:  <a href="http://www.schoolsInterop.org/docs/sifdraft.zip">http://www.schoolsInterop.org/docs/sifdraft.zip</a>
