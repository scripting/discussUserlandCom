All that's required is a mail list and a will to collaborate? <p>

seth>In utopia, no fee would be required. However, in the world I live in, funded projects and organizations *tend* to be more successful than non-funded ones. Also, members *tend* to take their memberships more seriously when they've had to pay something to join. <p>


Here's a thought... take those fees, add 'em together, and use it to buy *one* W3C membership.<p>

It's a way for us small fry to get a seat at the table.<p>
