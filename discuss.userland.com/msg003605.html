They agreed to disagree, and went their separate ways. Because of the recent changes in the Qt license (Qt is the toolkit used to write KDE), there's no longer any philosphical disagreement between the two groups.<p>

Gnome and KDE already co-exist fairly well. KDE includes a Gnome-compliant Window Manager. Both environments support the same drag and drop protocol. About the only work remaining is reconciling the "look and feel" of individual applications and getting OpenParts to talk to Baboon. None of this is especially difficult, but it will all take time.<p>

Please don't flame. The Gnome developers and the KDE developers get along OK, so why can't all the users respect each other?<p>

Good luck with 2.0!<p>

(And for the Windows and Macintosh developers out there--the Linux desktop will be a bit inconsistent for the next year or two. You can write one application and have it work anywhere, but there won't be a standard menu layout, for example.<p>

The server applications market will forgive this. Just make your look and feel match your Windows product, and nobody will complain. I don't know how end users would react, though, to such minor inconsistencies.)
