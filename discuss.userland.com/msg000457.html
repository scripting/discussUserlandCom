I'm thinking about how they preserved Compuserve; it still exists as an AOL division/subsidiary and has its own community and style. <p>

The underlying problem with Netcenter today is that it has no soul, no face, no real personality, voice, or identity. If the underlying services were available elsewhere and I had confidence they would persist, would I miss Netcenter? No. Your experience may have been different. <p>

Now ask people who frequent the Well or Compuserve or the Yahoo stock message boards or Bianca's Shack or GeoCities. These portals have a real sense of place and character and purpose. <p>

Q. Is Netcenter different enough in identity from AOL's web portal to justify sustaining it as a separate place?
