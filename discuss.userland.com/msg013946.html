The difficulty I have here is that I can't see "behind the curtain". All I can tell you is that even though my XML seems to be totally okay, the error keeps coming up. It's *very* frustrating, I wish I could be more helpful, but I don't know what else I can add.<p>

Perhaps you could submit my URL and see what happens? Maybe you already have, there's no way for me to know, but it might help.<p>

Just to be on the safe side, I'll resubmit now, coz I've just flipped my home page. Stand by...<p>

... Nope, same error. IPNetMonitor tells me that 206.204.24.21 just grabbed the file, if that helps. It sure looks like Frontier's interpreter (at your end) is throwing the error.<p>

Sorry about this, but I'm stumped.
