When you think about it, with 4 different corporate hardware architectures (OS/390, AS/400, RS/6000 and Wintel), IBM is one of the few companies for whom Java is a complete no-brainer.<p>

One of the best-kept secrets in the Java community is that IBM has the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/118/index.html">best Java VM for Windows</a>, (and, possibly, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/118/linux/index.html">Linux</a> as well, but I can't vouch personally for that).<p>

And this week, as I dive into XML for <a href="http://www.jera.com/jeraworks/">JeraWorks</a>, I've started playing with IBM's <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4j">XML Parser for Java</a>.  I haven't delved deeply into it, but it seems like a world-class implementation.  And you can't beat the price.
