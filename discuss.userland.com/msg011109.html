I can certainly imagine what Third Voice is like, and I've seen the screen shots.<p>

I'm not sure how it is terribly different from a website which puts scripting news in one frame, and scripting news-related Usenet postings in another frame. (This doesn't work so well with Scripting News; imagine instead Red Hat, Apple or Microsoft.) Third Voice is simply more efficient and more directly linked to website content.<p>

IMHO, the best response is to ignore Third Voice, and their users, because it's not likely to be terribly significant in the grand scheme of things. I mean, is there *any* utility to it? Is the signal/noise ratio high enough to provide any useful content?<p>

Getting annoyed about the things posted on TV makes as much sense as Metallica getting upset that someone wrote Metallica SuCKS! on some junior high desk somewhere.
