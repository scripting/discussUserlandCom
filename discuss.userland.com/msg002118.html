Can't say about SBC, but for GTE in California, the initial demand meant that the line check happened in 5 days instead of originally mentioned 2, and the install happen two weeks later.<p>

I have not needed to contact support at all. Works as Advertised. Feel like I am on the net at work, except that I don't get 800k/sec for local ftp transfers. I only get 20k/sec. I wish that we had cable modems to drive down the prices of the basic service, with ISP it comes to $65 a month (35 to GTE and 30 to the ISP).
