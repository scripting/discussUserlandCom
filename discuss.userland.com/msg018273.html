First, the new Themes feature is GREAT! Love it! But it's available to a site's master editor only. Next consider that a while ago someone clever worked out a scheme to let individual site users define their own colours in the prefs area.<p>

What if this were taken to the next level, so that a site editor could offer a set (sub-set?) of available themes, which any user could select from? Wouldn't that be an interesting level of interface personalisation? Individaul interfaces generated on the fly.<p>

Hairy to program I assume, but I think it would be very cool (if it could be done), and 'cool' is what gets people's attention.<p>

What do you think? It's just an idea.<p>

(FWIW, every time Frontier does something cool, it gets easier for me to convince clients to adopt it. It's frustrating when a technically superior solution is ignored due to ignorance, but then you demo something cool about it, and suddenly non-technical people are interested. Call it human nature. PS. the 60 day demo policy is a big help with this)
