and I discovered a great feature which would be really nice here as well.  xmltree.com will allow (looks like it's not working yet) you to configure channels such that you could recieve emails whenever that channel updates.  Perhaps this could be implmented here as well. Or perhaps something like a rule that says: "check the channel every hour, if it's updated email me the channel listing (or just sent the changed listings)"<p>

This would be really great! I could have it set up to send channel messages to my pager so I could read short newsbytes that I chose.
