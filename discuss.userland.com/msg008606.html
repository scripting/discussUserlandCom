I've noticed that tends to happen when one is inside a BLOCKQUOTE and then makes a TABLE that would ordinarily be as wide as the window (that is, width=100%). <p>

Even the most 'advanced' browsers seem to render such a sequence by first creating the window-wide table and <b>then</b> indenting it, pushing it past the right edge of your window no matter how wide it is.<p>

So I guess the answer is, don't blockquote your tables OR make your blockquoted tables' widths something less, like 95%, so they don't get pushed past the edge.
