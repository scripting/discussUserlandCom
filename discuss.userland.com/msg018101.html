I was hoping, when I first saw reports of this, that C|Net's reporter had conflated new features of Visual Studio 7 with the old COOL rumors, and that the other reports were just cribbing off of C|Net. Unfortunately, that's not true.<p>

It seems like they could have acheived 90% of the benefits of C# v. C++ by writing a good standard garbage collector for VC++, fully supporting the C++ standard, and getting a good STL implementation. Since STL and a good garbage collector also take care of most of the advantages of Java over C++, except for the much-vaunted platform independence, without requiring a language switch, I don't see why Microsoft didn't go this way. It's not likely that C# (or any new language Microsoft invents) will ever exist on non-Windows platforms.<p>

Note to Microsoft's tools group: Windows developers use Visual C++ and Visual Basic to develop desktop applications and COM/COM+ components. Borland couldn't change that with Delphi (in many ways better than VB) or C++Builder (in many ways better than VC++). Sun couldn't change this with Java. And Microsoft won't change it with C#. It's difficult to get developers to change tools even in the same language and on the same platform. Changing languages for no good reason just isn't going to fly.<p>

Besides, with the new features that are supposed to be added to Visual Basic in version 7, Microsoft has a powerful, easy to use, OO language that does garbage collection <em>and the millions of VB, VBA, and VBScript/ASP developers out there, like me, already understand it.</em>
