The thing I like about the web is that it's a LAN, and the protocols of the web don't know anything about operating systems, or where they do, they tend to be Unixy things. So in a sense when Mac/Windows became web-aware, they basically were being integrated into Unix networks. I suggest that from here-on we all invest in ways of communicating that work everywhere. Except in places where you can't. Honestly some of Mac/Windows should make it over to Unix. Like the proliferation of GUI APIs and UIs is crippling Unix on the desktop. Dave
