<li>Cobalt Qube (see <a href="http://cobalt.com">http://cobalt.com</a>)<p>

They build wonderful, Linux based Internet appliances. I recall you have a lot of experience w/ ASP coding: Cobalt recently aquired Chili!Soft, the leading non-MS ASP runtime evironment.<p>

Disclaimer: I have no connection to Cobalt, but I have and love my Qube.<p>
