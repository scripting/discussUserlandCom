I'm going to propose an agreement. No recitals, no politics, and no restrictions.<p>

If this is unfair to somebody, please tell me who, and why. Thank you!<p>

For what it's worth, this agreement is "legally compatible" with the GPL. You could, for example, contribute code to the Linux kernel using this agreement.<p>

Does this license cause outages for anybody?<p>
