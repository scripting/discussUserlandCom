"Looks more and more like <a href=http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/index.html>Cocoon</a> is reinventing the wheel. Why don't they use Zope??"<p>

I can think of several reasons that I perceive as valid--YMMV.<p>

<ol>
<li>Cocoon's primary focus is to be a publishing system based on emerging W3C standards, particularly XSLT. <a href="http://www.zope.org">Zope</a>, if only because it predates several of these emerging standards, seems not to rely on/support their use, having its own document object model, template language, etc.
<li>Despite some of the verbiage on the Cocoon site, there's no indication in reality that Cocoon has content management as a goal in the same sense/to the same extent that Zope, Frontier, Spectra, StoryServer... do. For example, there's no discussion of WebDAV support. This also puts Cocoon in contrast with, e.g. <a href="http://www.caucho.com/products/resin1.0">Resin</a>, whose "Future" section observes: "Quercus 1.0 will be a collection of useful Java libraries, XSL stylesheets and scripts. It may turn into a full-fledged content management system like Zope."
<li>Cocoon came from the Java Apache project, so not surprisingly, it's Java-based. The investment and momentum behind Java on the server is staggering. Even more staggering, it's paying off. Thanks largely to IBM, there are very-good-to-excellent JVMs for every credible server platform I can think of. While Python is, in fact, my favorite of the broad-based (UNIX, Windows, Mac) "scripting" languages, it still doesn't enjoy anything like the breadth and depth of support that Java does.

Zope's a fantastic system, and for folks who are already Python fans or who are literally starting from scratch and don't mind being effectively self-contained within the Zope community (meaning, finding resources--e.g. hiring people who already have Zope experience--will be difficult), I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.<p>

Otherwise, though, it seems wisest to look at system based on the W3C standards, whether they're commercial systems (<a href="http://www.evergreen.com">ECential&trade;</a>, <a href="http://www.bluestone.com">Total-e-Business&trade;</a>) or open source (<a href="http://www.caucho.com/products/resin1.0">Resin</a>, <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon">Cocoon</a>).<p>

And being Java-based is helpful both in terms of the quality of the available technology and in terms of the availability of resources, human and otherwise.
