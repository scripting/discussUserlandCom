Nope.  There a tons of GM (genetically modified) foods on the market, but no indiction or labelling that they are so.  They mix GM cereals with regular cereals without telling anyone.  Basically it seems to have happened without popping up on consumer radar screens.  Agro-business here very much has Congress in its pockets.<p>
