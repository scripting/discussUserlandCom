The technology that makes building an IE-based custom browser easy runs on the same operating systems (Win9x, WinNT, Win2K) that, according to most surveys, about 90% of web users are using right now.<p>

A Mozilla/XUL based custom browser might reach 98% of users instead of 90%. But when you consider that since IE3.0 first made custom browsers easy to build, very few companies have picked up the custom-browser-on-Windows ball and run with it, I just can't see how a small increase in the base of potential users will change things.<p>

If an approach isn't popular on Windows, then the same approach delivered in a cross-platform way will likely still be unpopular.
