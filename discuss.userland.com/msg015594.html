I'm sorry but did I read the firedrop site wrong?
A firedrop zaplet sends javascript in an email message? <p>

Just sent one to myself, and damn, unlike news there is no simple way to turn off friggin scripting languages in my mail program. I selected restricted sites, but that the default still allows scripting in HIGH security. Microsoft security, Millitary intelligence, same thing.<p>

I don't mind HTML mail, but I do mind that I can't turn off scripting.  Spamming sex sites add javascript to news messages so that they pop up new browser windows that will not close without visiting a site. I reall don't need my mail program allowing for spammers to do the same thing.
