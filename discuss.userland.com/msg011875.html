How do you mean "should"? Because it would be good for them, or good for the community? What if they WANT to control the look-and-feel of an auction on eBay? <p>

For example, what if a meta-auction site re-packaged the reputation information from eBay--gave a rating of "Trusted" to a seller with only one or two bad comments. Maybe eBay wouldn't like this. And think what a malicious site could do.<p>

I think this relates to the Third Voice debate, although it might be more of a TicketMaster thing. Sites want to spread information around, but still control it. But how much control is desirable, technically possible and/or morally acceptable?<p>

I agree that they "should" (I want them to) syndicate, but I think you'll agree that they "should" be able to do what they want with their information.
