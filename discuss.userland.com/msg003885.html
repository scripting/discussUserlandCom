I think the strategy discussion is neither an expression of satisfaction nor mistrust. It is the symptom of a identification of the users with the (possible) product values. It's OK to keep trust by not promoting values which aren't really there. Everybody knows that and I think everybody likes that (and that's why so many people do not like some corporations or persuasive campaigns).<p>

Frontier has an appealing understatement - no fancy high-end glossy product description, no funky packaging - but nevertheless a own definition of good quality, which demands some sort of respect from the user. I think you got that from the Frontier users, because I think all those who do not have the right attitude will delete Frontier from their drives after 10 minutes of exploring anyway.<p>

Frontier is different from other applications: You won't be just throwing it away and then simply do it with something else (like substituting MS Office with StarOffice). So people (hopefully) have a long term view upon their investment into Frontier. So they discuss long term issues.<p>

You shouldn't be pissed off by this. (I remeber your statement when you closed the mailing-list last year here.) But just: If people do not seem to follow the discussion on a subject very well, maybe you do not have the perfect interface for your DG yet? ;-)<p>
