It has come to my attention that Userland, with only a little bit of effort, could be raking in the dough for years and years to come, safe from the volatility of the Internet.<p>

Using the experiences gained from the creation of www.EditThisPage.com, I believe that Userland should turn to the creation of www.EditThis<A HREF="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?pate">Pate</A>.com.  Forget Hair Club for Men, forget Rogaine, the company that brought you "Powerful easy web publishing, in your web browser" will now bring you "Powerful easy hair populating, in your web browser".  <p>

The best part is that Userland is already 95% of the way there (19/20 chars).  If Userland would only take the small step of one character, the opportunity for profit would be boundless.
