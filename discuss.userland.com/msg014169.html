I want to access and use my files from anywhere - I want to remotely call programs on my mac from some PC (using rpc, I guess :) ). I want to fire up an FTP program and access my files.

OS X is just around the corner. Since it is UNIX based, there is no reason to think you won't have everything your asking for... FTP, WWW, you will even be able to telnet in and do just about anything you like from the command line. Plus it will still be a Mac, a machine that is as easy and pleasant to use as they have always been. Maybe even more so.
