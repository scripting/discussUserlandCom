To build in features that make it work well with services that the company offers. Of course it would do so in the Internet way, openly, so that others like Yahoo and eBay could benefit too. That's monetizable, at least the way the stock market currently values Internet companies, even after the "correction".<p>

The thing that a lot of people overlook is that sooner or later Microsoft is going to make that work if left unchecked. The opportunities to sneak features into the browser that favor their own sites is one that so far they haven't done or haven't done visibly or effectively. But the opportunity is there.<p>

Further, I think it's good for the Internet if it should happen, because the browsers are stagnating and are not being driven by Web developers and their applications.
