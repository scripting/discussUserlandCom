Thanks, that's very close to what I was trying to express.<p>

As far as your retort, sorry, musicians are product. At least the current machinery put in place by the big labels makes them that. What we're arguing about here IMHO is how to get the artist back into music, how to give the musician freedom to be an artist and not a packaged product.<p>

A point not often raised is that bits are bits, you're paying for the bits on the CD, not the plastic and aluminum layers of stuff. MP3 is bits too, in a purer (;-) form. Once an artist makes bits they're no longer in control (practically speaking now, not legalistically) of the distribution.<p>

So what I was trying to say is that this (the new breed of bits that is MP3 and the new distribution mechanism that is Napster and whatever comes after that) are a huge opportunity, and people should not waste time being worried about "control".
