day's items are organized with newer
items added at the bottom of the block.<p>

Doesn't this cause a problem in the
"My Netscape" channel, which only lists
the top 3-4 items? Or am I wrong about
either the way the channel gets put together
(it does look like it lists the top 3-4 items)
or how Scripting News items are added?<p>

While I've added the channel to My Netscape,
I rarely look at it, since scripting news
is probably my most frequently visited page.
I do use the channels to track slower-moving
sites like mozilla.org and mozillazine,
though.
