1) are available over the Internet
2) have a published interface<p>

I am not having much luck.  I cannot find such a list AND the two servers that I do know about, I cannot find the interface for.<p>

Specifically, the two servers I know of are the 'betty' server and the Mail to the Future server.  Are the interfaces for those servers defined somewhere?  I know of the examples.getStateName method on betty and the mailToTheFuture.addMessage method... but I found out about them almost by accident.<p>

So is there such a resource?
