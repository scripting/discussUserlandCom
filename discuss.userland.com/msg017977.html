While Adobe doesn't exactly go out-of-the-way to let users know, Illustrator 9 is now scriptable via a plug-in. The scripting plug-in isn't even an option on the Illustrator 9 installer, you have to manually put it in Illustrator's plug-ins folder. Actually, I was just peeking around the upgrade CD-ROM when I stumbled across the scripting folder which can be located with the following path: Adobe&#174; Illustrator&#174;:Adobe Solutions Network:Illustrator 9.0 SDK:Scripting.<p>

The folder includes the plug-in, several example applescripts and a 434 page PDF file documenting Illustrator 9 scripting via Applescript on MacOS & Visual Basic on Windows.<p>

I browsed the documentation and ran a few of the sample scripts and I was pretty impressed at the level of integration. This is great news for all scripters, and it's only a matter of time before we can tie in frontier an XML-RPC.
