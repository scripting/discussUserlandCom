It has a lot of explanatory text, it's not just a pure XML DTD.<p>

Some interesting highlights:<p>

<UL><LI><A HREF="http://www.iptc.org/NewsML/vocabularies/iptc-confidence.xml">Confidence levels</A> assigned to metadata.</LI><p>

<LI>A news item can contain instructions to delete a previous news item; used to update old news with new reports.  (Interesting, if you think about the potential uses.)</LI></UL><p>

As specced, the format is quite complicated and I'd be surprised to see anyone outside of the full-fledged news services to use it to its fullest.  There's a lot of meta-data they're preparing to keep track of, too, such as seperate listings of countries and people reference in the news, making easy For More Information links possible (for instance).
