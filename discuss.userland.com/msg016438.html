So true. And interestingly, it's possible to tap a lot of its potential client-side, through the excellent support for XML that you now have in Mozilla.<p>

(Evangelism jets turning the other way for a moment.)<p>

<b>XML XML XML XML XML</b><p>

The entire story flow is available through XML. <p>

Theoretically with locally-running JavaScript, you should be able to provide anything a user might want. If not, maybe the stuff you can access through JS should be expanded.<p>

<b>If you'd rather just have a web app..</b><p>

If someone who knows Frontier teams up with Andrew and a few others perhaps, I will contribute a free Frontier subscription for a project to provide alternate user interfaces for the My.UserLand story flow. <p>

We ship <a href="http://samples.userland.com/stories/storyReader$62">code</a> for a My.UserLand affiliate, it works, it's how My.UserLand works. The app you use is just an HTML interface on affiliate2.root, nothing more.<p>

<b>Round and round we go</b><p>

Andrew I think it would be really cool if Netscape operated a Frontier server for this stuff.<p>

my.mozilla.netscape.com??<p>

What a trip round the loop that would be!!<p>

Think Killer App&trade;
