No one responded to my query.  I looked up a service center of the manufacturer of the drive mechanism. After talking with the service center, I decided to replace/upgrade my unit.  I was in desperate need of a drive fast and it would have taken some time for the service center to turn the drive around, and there was no guarantee it could be repaired.  I purchased a new raw drive from buy.com and put it into the old case.  I'm a happy camper again.
