We actually own a 64 MB RAM upgrade that lays on my desk because no one wants to take the time in add it to the iMac.<p>

With VM on, 32 MB will be plenty of RAM for almost all homes and Mac OS 8.6 at 300 Mhz is VERY FAST.  Personally I hope they offer a family pack of 3 for $4499 with a free AirDock.<p>

Sure I wish the price was $300 lower, but I predict the iBook will be the best selling Mac ever.  Assuming they can deliver this product on time, I bet they sell 1.2M iBooks buy the end of March 2000 and another 1.2M by September 2000.<p>
