I tend to think of Ballmer as generally 'not great' .<p>

Ballmer's body language (and overall presentation) is the most distracting to me of anyone in the industry aside from Jobs. Jobs' body language distracts positively. For most people, if you don't like the words, he'll make you like them by his presence. Its a rare gift which he posesses and is aware of. JFK was like that. Ballmer is the opposite. He seems clumsy and uncomfortable. Like Amelio was. Like Carter was. <p>

Now, these people aren't dumb, aren't lacking in talent, and I'm saying nothing about their ability to lead. But the game of being the actor on the stage isn't for Ballmer, IMO. Look at his attire. A mix of geek casual and business. Blue shirt like Gates, open collar, and a jacket. Why? Either be casual or don't be casual. He seems indecisive. Clumsy. <p>

He's slouching a bit. You can't <i>just</i> sit for any period of time without slouching. Make them stand. Sitting, exposed, just looks bad. Jobs always walks. You can't slouch, or look lazy, or uninterested if you walk. No big podium or table. It looks like you are hiding.<p>

The picture above a bit distracting in that Ballmer seems to be sitting 6-12 inches in front of everyone else. That's okay if he's speaking, but he's not. So it appears that he wants you to see him, even though Gates is speaking. But I think it's just this shot...<p>

Gates is not slouching - he shuffles, though. Jobs uses his bottle of water as a fidget mechanism. It works very well - try it. People will excuse you getting something to drink when speaking, but not fidgeting. Gates uses his hands very well. He <i>appears</i> in charge almost at all times. He almost always smiles (something Jobs doesn't do enough) even when he's being a bully. He's better at this game, though he wasn't always. He's gotten better at the presentation...
