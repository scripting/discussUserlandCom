mozilla's been going through a lot to get ready for a 6.0 release of netscape, and I'm finally at a point where I'm not putting out fires on a daily basis, so I revamped the lute files and re-posted them on the link above. Using the files I refer to (they are in a zip file) you can view OPML files "natively" in mozilla.<p>

This is the first step (of mine) to getting an OPML editor, and eventually a playlist editor, outliner, etc. etc. for mozilla.<p>

you need a very recent (past few days) build of mozilla to have this work.  I'll  post a screen shot tomorrow of it working...
