Sure, webEdit is great because it's so simple - and so powerful. And I'm sure I'll have added soon all what I need too (I already began, in fact). <p>

But everyone doesn't have the time or the feeling to do so. That's why I thought these remarks could be of some use to UserLand.<p>

Maybe I should have titled it "features ideas" rather than "feature requests", though.
