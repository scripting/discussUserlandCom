<br>You could have applied for patents on the improvements you
made to the 2nd and 3rd generations, then your (ex-)friend couldn't
use them.  He could still prevent you from distributing the original.
But perhaps your lawyers could work out something amicable to
break the stalemate.<p>

Of course, if your refinements were just put out there in the
poolic domain, he gets those for free.<p>

<i>...it should be unethical to file for a patent without making a public disclosure.</i>
<br>A patent <i>is</i> a public disclosure, and an eventual surrender
of the idea to the public.  The requirements for disclosure of an
application vary, and are changing.<p>

<i>...if it turns out you were patenting the things we were co-inventing...</i>
<br>that would be fraudulent, and/or grounds for invalidating the
patent.  A US patent (at least) has to have
the inventors (and <i>only</i> the inventors) listed in the application.<p>

(These are legal, um, <i>suggestions</i>, of course, not "legal
advice."  YMMV.)<p>
