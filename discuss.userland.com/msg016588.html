<p>I may be reading that wrong, but it seems to me that this is about as draconian than the ISP user agreements we've been looking at for the last few days. I don't think Dave would actually use that clause due to content, but by the same token I don't think Above Net would use their similar clause due to content. Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
