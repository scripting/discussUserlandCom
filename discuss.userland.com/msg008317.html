All of the information in an OCS document *should* be in config.root so hopefully not much extra work would be required.<p>

I have some concerns regarding some of the syntax which I've put in another DG message(a reply to Ian's previous post), but other than that, the only question I have is whether the size of the file will matter.  It seems that with the number of channels at My.UserLand.Com, the 'new' serviceList file would be quite large.<p>

I guess it wouldn't be that big of a deal since an app wouldn't be loading that file very often.<p>
