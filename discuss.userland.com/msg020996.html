I realize that I was too quick to respond in some messages in the past few days, and slipped up and let sloppy arguments and thinking get in the way of reasonable responses.  It's an easy trap to fall into.  In many cases I was, in fact, unable to respond to the majority of points because so many messages were mixing in valid points with pejoratives, repeated misstatements, etc.<p>

I would enjoy hearing any criticism, good or bad, of my thinking process.  I pride myself on keeping a clear thought process, and feel bad when I slip out of it.
