Peter Orvetti summarized the current election news in 250 words or less two times a day in the weeks before the election, three times a day in the final week, and continuously on election night. His site was even-handed in its treatment of the candidates and parties, even giving coverage to all of the third-party presidential candidates with ballot access. The interface was extremely simple, but in terms of content I must have loaded the site 500 times in the past month alone.
