Just out of curiosity, I looked to see how the
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/patft/index.html">USPTO</a> is doing
these days.<p>

They issued 3442 utility patents on August 1st (the most recent
batch on their website; they come out on a two week cycle?).  I
looked at the statistics for the filing date of the last 50
of those.<p>

Average = 3.1 years
<br>Minimum = 1.4 years
<br>Maximum = 15.0 years  (filed in 1985?!  Next highest was 6.7)
<br>Std. Dev. = 1.9 years  (0.9 without the flier)<p>

It's probably a little understated; I noticed one filed mid-1999 that was a continuation of an earlier filing.  I used the original filing date, but might have missed others like that.<p>

Since we
<a href="http://pobox.com/~tva/usp6M.html">passed 6,000,000</a>
last December, that's right around 100,000 in 8 months.  We should pass 7 million well before the mid-oughts.<p>
