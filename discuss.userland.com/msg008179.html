I assumed that I was the only person confused (or at least that it wasn't important to anyone else).  Would it be possible to control something like this from the user preferences? I know that I can change this from my browser's settings (using IE5 at the moment) but I don't think that I can specify it according to site and I don't want to change the colours for every site.
