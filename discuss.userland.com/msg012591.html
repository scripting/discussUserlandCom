It's both invitation-only and opt-in.  You create a forum that has a long random URL, and you forward that URL to your invitee list.  Invitees can read/respond via browser or receive email for new replies.<p>

It's short of being a full-fledged community, however, because it's designed to be single-topic and extremely simple to use.  As such, it currently lacks some features that a longer-lived community would want, such as message threading and personalization.<p>

A single-topic forum has one advantage in this context:  you can adjust your community's scope every time you start a new topic, since you announce each new topic via email.
