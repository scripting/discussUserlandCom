Make it something general, something that gets across the mood you want to convey, something that makes you feel good when you hear it.<p>

That probably makes it harder, but it's still possible. Let me see if I can come up with a few...<p>

SoundGather<br>
AudiWeb (pronounced Awd-eh-web)<br>
AcousticMass<br>
HarmonyShare<br>
BandedTogether<br><p>

hmm... I like soundgather, the rest are garbage.
