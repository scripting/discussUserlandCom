Then it sounds like your question is how to make a site work like this one does, with the discussion group at the top level. I don't have a step-by-step tutorial handy, but it's fairly simple. Create the site. In Frontier, promote everything in the discuss table. Then edit the #urls table -- anything with /discuss/ should have the discuss part removed. That's it.
