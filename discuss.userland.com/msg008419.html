It links to a <a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$134">story</a> I wrote, and can easily add to, that explains what a Weblog is, and how the editor works on My.UserLand.Com.<p>

<blockquote>"A weblog is a new kind of website that's becoming popular and is easy to create and update. A weblog links to other websites, it's a collection of links, updated frequently, often several times a day, that represent the interests of a single web person. It's a neat way to share what you learn with other people who like to use the web."</blockquote><p>

Then it occurred to me that I should ask the question here. <i>What is a weblog?</i> When people ask, what should we tell them?</img>
