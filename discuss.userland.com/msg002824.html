Dave, I've seen you write something like this many times and every time I wonder where you've got the idea that CORBA is a Unix only thing?  The whole point of CORBA is language independent interface specification (and IIOP gives you a wire protocol).  There's no OS dependency at all.  One area where CORBA shines is tying together apps written on different platforms (hardware & OS) & with different APIs.<p>

Where CORBA is ugly is in its language bindings to older languages such as C (and, to a lesser extent, C++) since they are much more low-level than, say, Java & python, both of which are a dream to do CORBA stuff with.<p>

Anyway, in a week or so, after my current work-crunch, I'll put together a simple XML-RPC to CORBA bridge using DII.  BTW, if type tags go away, then this type of thing becomes <i>much</i> more difficult.
