I was present on openbsd-tech when he posted that message.  I do not recall him posting anything to the list after the initial message.  Let's check the <a href="msg020179.html">archives</a>.  Hmm... There are two additional poats additional posts by rms:<p>

<blockquote><i>[Forbes] said that I sabotaged the programs of Symbolics. That 
is not true. I did not do anything to their programs. I just 
improved MIT's programs.</i></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><i>
To accuse a person of sabotage, a crime, is a serious matter. If the 
accusation comes from Brett Glass, it can be ignored, but when other 
people do say it I'm entitled to refute it. I am sorry that the 
accusation was made on your mailing list.</i></blockquote><p>

Neither of these appears to be flames at least to me.  The reference to you, Brett, may offend, but I do not see why you should offended that rms feels he can ignore you.<p>

Mark.
