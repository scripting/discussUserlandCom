Something to consider when you're looking at messaging systems is <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</A>. It's an interesting Open Source project that's started to come along recently. Interoperates with other IM systems (ICQ, AIM, etc.) Even if you decide to hook up with one of the "big boys", they've put some thought into what they're doing. Might be helpful...<p>

Good luck!<p>
