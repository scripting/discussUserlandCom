Break your posting up into sections and you'll like the way it looks. The reasoning is that if you're editing it in Frontier you must be writing something that's more like a document. Also, the renderer, as you might suspect, is totally replaceable. It's specified by the #renderDiscussOutlinesWith server attribute. It works exactly like #renderOutlineWith, which you're probably already familiar with.
