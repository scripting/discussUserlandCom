You can buy GPLed software and you can sell it.  That is certainly commercial.  What it does prohibit is taking GPLed software and making it proprietary.  If you don't like that, then you *should* avoid the GPL.  But don't avoid it because you like commercial software.  Cygnus does very well and has been using mostly GPLed software for over a decade.<p>

Second, it sounds like what you want is a BSD license (<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html</a>)
or Apache license (<a href="http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt">http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt</a>).<p>

Another good page that I just found is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/</a> -- they even have fill-in-the-blank templates for some licenses.
