But that's not the comparison I would be interested in. How about the fastest Web server under $5000, period? That seems like a more relevant benchmark to me.<p>

Some people have investments in Apache's API or in the knowledge it takes to configure it, but I don't. So I don't really care what Web server a system comes with as long as it's fast and reliable.
