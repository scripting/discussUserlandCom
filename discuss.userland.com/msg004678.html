<i>Anyway, with the half-done editorial suite, it's relatively easy to get script bits attached to a DG message.</i><p>

You may also want to provide a way for people to attach a pointer to where the object lives, or a page that describes the object.  Some people will want to maintain the script/suite/object on their own servers; for ease of maintenance.<p>

I actually see this as a hybrid of the user's pref page (where you can enter attributes about the object) and the discussion group (where you can enter text info, it's searchable, etc.).
