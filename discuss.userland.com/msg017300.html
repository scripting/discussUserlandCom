That's not quite accurate.<p>

The hack came due to a combination of world writable ftp directories that were in the web server tree and a not secure installation of Bugzilla (a set of perl scripts for tracking bugs that interface with MySql). Bugzilla is apparently difficult to install securely, and as a consequence, MySql was running as root. <p>

The hack vector was (roughly) ftp -> web directory -> php file -> mysql (running as root) -> hacked.<p>

In default red hat installations, there are no world writable ftp directories, and bugzilla and mysql aren't even installed.<p>
