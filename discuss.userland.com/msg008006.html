being able to edit one's DG message after it's been posted.  While
on a number of occasions I've used this feature to fix typos and
better formulate my thoughts, it seems as though it could be used
maliciously to change the appearance and context of a message thread.<p>

Does anyone else out there share these concerns?  One possible
feature to deal with this might be message versioning, and possibly,
only allowing a message to be added to and of course timestamping the
changes.<p>

Comments?<p>
