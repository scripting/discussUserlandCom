Cool!  Now i've got this "MySite.root "file, and i've converted the type and creator tags.  I was even able to open the file in RadioUserland, so i can now see this three-column table with attributes "name", "value", and "kind".  Only problem is, drilling down thru the rows of this table, i'm still not able to get at the values for attributes i expect to see associated with each record - like member profile, preferences (excepting password, of course), messages posted, useage stats.  I also tried opening it in Excel, but of course it can't read the file without knowing some stuff about data definition (i.e. column delimiters, etc.).<p>

If it seems that i'm trying to hack a proprietary file format, i'm certainly not.  I really never expected to enjoy such access without buying a Frontier licence - but still, i'm left wondering:  is that what i need to do now in order to get at this data in useable form?  And if i do that, will i not find myself way in over my head?  As i've said, i am no programmer, and have no desire to become one at this point in my life.<p>

If these questions are too dumb for this forum, maybe someone could e-mail me, or give a number to call for support.  Thanks again!  |/|/  (<a href="mailto:wludwick@mail.walmar.com">wludwick@mail.walmar.com</a>)
