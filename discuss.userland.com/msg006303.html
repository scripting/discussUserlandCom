But it certainly isn't "significant".  BSD has a leaner and meaner TCP stack.  The Linux TCP stack isn't quite as lean, it has hooks and interfaces for misc stuff that BSD stack doesn't have.  It is a little slower, but by stretch of the imagination is it significant.<p>

People always sighted the lack of a Command Line as a weakness of the MacOS.  The MacOS people always thought of their lack of a commandline as a strength for the type of work they wanted to do.  When it comes right down to it, BSD came from UNIX, which was a server OS first.  Linux started as a Workstation OS and evolved(through striving for UNIX compatibility) into a good Server OS.  Differences in the OS are more due to differences in approach, not any inherent weakness in the code.
