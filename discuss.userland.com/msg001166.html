This solution allows Frontier's UI to be visible when running behind IIS using the iisFrontier.dll. (Untested with .asp pages, but should work the same.)<p>

I'd like to hear any comments from IIS and COM experts about my solution: if there are potential problems with it, I'd like to know.<p>

If you're willing to try a not thoroughly tested solution, here's what you do. After making sure IIS and Frontier are not currently running:<p>

1) From the Start Menu, click Run.<p>

2) Type dcomcnfg and click OK.<p>

3) The Distributed COM Configuration Properties dialog box appears. Scroll to the bottom of the Applications tab window.<p>

4) Select the line that reads: UserLand, Frontier, Server<p>

5) Click Properties.<p>

6) Click the Identity tab.<p>

7) To the question:<p>

"Which user account do you want to use to run this application?"<p>

Click the radio button labelled:<p>

"The interactive user."<p>

This means that when Frontier is launched by IIS, it will be launched in the currently logged-in user's space, not in the invisible IIS desktop.<p>

This also probably means that you'll always have to log into a machine running Frontier, unless you switch back to:<p>

"The launching user."<p>

8) Click OK.<p>

9) Click OK again.
