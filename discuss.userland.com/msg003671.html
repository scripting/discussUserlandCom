My pre-disposition was to consider this nothing more than an overgrown, clunky Palm-wannabe. After using it for a weekend, I am a convert. I want one! This is not a replacement for my Palm III, but definitely is a replacement for my laptop. Instant on is a key feature for me. I loved being able to flip it open and immediately start <i>writing</i> a note to myself. Hand writing recognition makes this a viable note-taking device in my work as a physician. It's got a built-in modem and the pocket IE and mail apps. If we get "webwide applications" this may be enough...<p>

Oh, another thing. The model I had came with an IR port. I didn't get to try it out though.
