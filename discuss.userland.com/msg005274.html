While this is true, I don't think that it is the *real* problem. I think that the default page in the second console site grabs the wrong news text not from the cache, but rather from the first console site's discussion group. Take another look at consoleSuite.getMsgTable. Here's the first line:<p>

<pre>try &#123;delete (@consoleData.cache.msgtable)} <a href="//">//</a> disabled caching; Wed, 07 Apr 1999 23:45:05 GMT by AR</pre><p>

(This raises the question: Does consoleData.cache need to exist on disk at all?)<p>

I think that the main reason that creating a copy of consoleSite causes the two sites to step on each other's data is (as I previously pointed out <<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5248">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$5248</a>>)that consoleSuite.getMsgTable was specifically referring to the original <b>consoleSite</b> with this line:<p>

<pre>with consoleData.servers.[consoleSite.["#newsServer"]] &#123;</pre><p>

I am able to preview and edit the news in both my console sites with this change. (Yes, I've made a few more minor changes).
