You could have more file-space, some tools for local/network transparency for gems (imagine being able to have a gem that you work on commonly actually stored on your machine, and the EditThisPage actually only has a 'reference' to your locally stored gem which is accessed through a micro-http server), a native Windows/Mac/Linux user-interface that accesses the XML-RPC methods exposed from EditThisPage for a more fluid UI experience, etc.  Quick, I want to send you money! :) By the way, make sure to <a href="http://www.jibjab.com/cartoons/raps/rp_movie02.htm">see this</a>.  What the heck does that have to do with EditThisPage? Absolutely nothing!<p>

Thanks,
  Brad GNUberg<br>
