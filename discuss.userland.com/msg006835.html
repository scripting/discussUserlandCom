Privacy is a big topic on the Internet today. In September 1997, in DaveNet, <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/09/BillGatesonPrivacy">Bill Gates said</a>: "For some reason the public isn't hearing about this issue at all. I can't believe there isn't more of an outcry." Finally people are tuning in. They are recording everything you say. It can and will be used against you. "A new cyberdictator could ask his MIS department to do a query against the email database. Find me six million people to kill, and give me a reason to kill them."<p>

Drew Ivan: 'Back in 1945, Vannevar Bush's <a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/elab/hfl0051.html">landmark essay</a> "As We May Think" described a device called Memex that sounds a lot like today's Worldwide Web. He envisioned a class of people called Trailblazers who were adept at wading their way through hypertexts and leaving a trail of links for others to follow. Weblogs are to the WWW what Trailblazers were to Memex, except not hypothetical.'<p>
