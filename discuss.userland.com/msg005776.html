See:  <a href="http://www.schoolsInterop.org/">http://www.schoolsInterop.org/</a><p>

This IS going to be a big deal for almost every school district because currently so many software packages can't talk to one another and for some apps it is a real bugger just to export/import data. (I like the expression "data tombs.") On the brighter side, many of the existing packages can be tied together with Frontier. :-)<p>

If anybody has more information on what this standard will be, I would like to know.<p>
