Dan Quayle is smart the way an artificial intelligence program is smart. Stay within the bounds of what it has been programmed to deal with and the AI is indistinguishable from a human being. Step outside those bounds and it quickly becomes apparent what you are dealing with.<p>

Dan Quayle is -not- a very bright person. His handlers, however, are. They are very good at coaching him and giving him the right answers to the questions he is likely to be asked.<p>

But, catch him off guard with a question he "thinks" he knows to answer to (but has not been coached on) and things start to fall apart. <p>
