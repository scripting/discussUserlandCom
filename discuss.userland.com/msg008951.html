And this is a problem: Today's my last day in town before leaving the country for a month, and I need to unsubscribe from the Frontier-Users and Frontier-Servers mailing lists... but I can't get email through to <a href="mailto:requests@userland.com">requests@userland.com</a>.<p>

UserLand, please help... I'd rather not have my mailbox overflow or my "vacation" automated response get blasted to everyone on the lists every time a message goes out!<p>

Thanks...<p>

Addendum: I just discovered the earlier thread about DNS problems at UserLand. Since I'm still having problems, I guess it's my university's cache that's to blame. Unfortunately, our postmaster seems to be taking the Friday off. Argh...<p>
