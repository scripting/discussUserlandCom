Secondly, if Frontier is not to process the page, how do I send it back to IIS ?</i><p>

In theory, it's a solvable problem.<p>

You'd need an ISAPI Filter DLL that decides whether or not Frontier handles the request. This DLL would actually make a COM call to Frontier, Frontier would run a script, and return true or false. If true -- meaning Frontier wants the page -- then the Filter DLL would re-write the URL so that it would be handled by the iisfrontier DLL that we make available.<p>

The tricky part is you've got to actually write an ISAPI Filter DLL. This means you're in C++ land, working in Visual Studio, actually writing this code.<p>

On the plus side, you can get source code from us that has all the basic elements you'd need -- our source has examples of ISAPI Filters, and it shows how to connect to Frontier via COM from IIS.<p>

Another approach would be to devise a set of rules and stick with them. The nice thing about having Frontier pre-process requests is that it would be easy to change the rules. However, you lose some efficiency that way, having to send that COM request and run a script for every single request. It might be better to formalize your rules and code them in C++ to begin with. Also, in some ways you'd have an *easier* to maintain system, since the rules would be less dynamic.
