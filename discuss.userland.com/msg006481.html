Yes, that's supposed to be the case. If you have suggestions for improvement, please let me know.<p>

<i>Specifically, the console stuff doesn't seem to be able to get discussion messages posted...</i><p>

What exactly are you trying to do? Editing the daily news page? Or posting a story? Or something else?<p>

Do you get error messages? If so what exactly do the error messages say?<p>

Did you try posting discussion group messages thru the regular web interface? Does it work?<p>

Some general things to check:<p>

The console relies on XML-RPC to communicate with the server. Please make sure that user.webserver.responders.RPC2.enabled is set to true on the server.<p>

Also, user.betty.rpcHandlers should contain address objects named nirvanaServer and mainResponder pointing to the mainResponder.rpchandlers table in mainResponder.root.<p>

<i>...and static news pages don't render when new news items appear.</i><p>

To clarify, when you update the news page, the static page isn't rendered immediately. Rather it is added to a queue of pages. Once every minute, a script renders all pages in that queue.<p>

The script that does this is mainResponder.background.everyMinute. The queue is kept at system.temp.mainresponder.backgroundPagesToBuild.<p>

This requires at least two things to work: config.mainresponder.prefs.flBuildPagesInBackground must be set to true, and user.scheduler.everyMinute must contain an address object pointing to the mainResponder.background.everyMinute script.<p>

If this doesn't help, the next thing to do is to check the scheduler log for error messages. It's either at user.scheduler.log or in the schedulerMonitor sub-table of your daily log GDB.<p>

<i>I've reinstalled Frontier 3 times now, along with the news and console roots and the result is the same each time.</i><p>

I am pretty sure this is some sort of configuration problem, so you shouldn't bother to reinstall a fourth time. If you can give me some more information, I should be able to point you in the right direction.
