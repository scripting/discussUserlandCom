I don't have any idea. ;-)<p>

As far as I can understand it, it is a problem of transport between the server (holding the content) and the client (displaying it). A "expand everything" can result in a quite huge download -- making the outline clumsy and sluggish. It could work well on a LAN maybe.<p>

I did some experimtens with a hidden frame, through which I pulled contents from the server and then I used the "innerHTML" object to replace partial content in the visible frame ("innerHTML" is IE4-only I think).<p>

Most of the examples I found require you to have out the complete structure in the page and the scripts just provide ways to hide and reveal specific parts of the whole structure.<p>

Every expand action would have to be checked against structure on the server. Every click-to-edit in the text would have to automatically check out the object. That's a lot of traffic. I am not aware of what "persistent connections" could do here, but if the messaging between client and server could be solved in a "streaming" way (without permanent http requests which cause additional delay each time) I think there could be a lot of performance gain then.<p>
