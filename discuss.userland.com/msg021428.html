Microsoft was also stupid to focus their attention on Netscape when there was something much bigger on the table that Microsoft <i>and</i> Netscape ignored -- the HTML developers who were caught in the crossfire.<p>

I wonder if this point has ever penetrated the Microsoft defensive system. You guys broke your cardinal rule, developers come first. First with the HTML developers, then when Sun/Netscape made the mistake of trying to convert HTML developers to Java, the Java developers.<p>

You guys *created* the "open source movement". What else could they do but organize in their hatred of Microsoft. I understand it. You guys did us a disservice, the commercial developers, and you did a bigger disservice to your own mission, imho.
