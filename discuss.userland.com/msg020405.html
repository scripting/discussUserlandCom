Fundamentally, he's a pragmatist and in his day 
job he arguably <i>is</i> one of those "hard-working
commercial developers." Also, AFAIK, he's the one who 
was behind the two GPL exceptions that make Linux
a reasonable commercial platform:
<br><br>
1) using Linux syscalls is not derivation according to the Linux GPL
<br><br>
2) binary, closed-source modules can be linked to the kernel (though he has no patience for those vendors who want Linux kernel developers to spend time and effort making their lives easier instead of improving Linux).
<br><br>
He's also universally respected and has an open mind. For example, he recently admitted that however distorted the Mindcraft tests may have been they had a valid point and they helped the Linux community find and remove important kernel bottlenecks.
<br><br>
The downside is that he certainly will be difficult to get through to and he will likely be a hard sell. But nothing ventured, nothing gained.
