I spent two hours today trying to debug a problem with my page, and it turned out to be that when I had "margin-left: 20px" in one of my styles, Netscape refused to render another table on the page; <i>note that this table was not using this style, and was in fact nowhere near the object that <b>was</b> using this style.</i>  Putting "margin-left: 10px" solved the problem.  STRANGE.<p>

(To see these effects, look at the home page of <a href="http://queso.editthispage.com/">my editthispage site</a> -- it is using a style sheet without the offending line, and there are links in the first two paragraphs to versions with 10px and 20px lines in the style sheets.)
