I've gotten a bunch of flamemail today, and I decided it just isn't worth it. There are lots of places where you can go for free-for-all discussions, let's switch the discussion around to pointers to the best ones, and then move the discussion over there.<p>

I don't want be a cop, I don't want the flames, I'm busy, I like what I do, I don't want you to change me, and I'm just plain tired of the immaturity of some people, and yes I have to deal with them all (you don't).<p>

OK, so that's it. Any more messages about Clinton and Republicans or new amendments to the Constitution will be deleted, so please don't bother posting them.<p>
