Eric Kidd: <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$4124">Zope and Frontier Compared</a>. This becomes more interesting as we move towards Unix. We want to deploy apps that scale up to millions of users. We will use Frontier as a content management and rapid development environment. Until we have Frontier running on Linux, we will deploy in some other environment. If we can build a bridge to Zope, and if its applications scale well on Intel hardware, we'll go with Zope.<p>

Key point: We made a decision last month that we should not wait for Frontier to get to Unix. We can't really, because we can't turn away users. <a href="http://www.mailtothefuture.com/">Mail To The Future</a>, for example, is growing, there's more press coming, following the Yahoo <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/05/thanksYahoo">endorsement</a>. And eventually I think <a href="http://my.userland.com/">My.UserLand.Com</a> is going to develop into a major Internet portal. We won't hold the apps back waiting for Frontier to get to Linux. Some people may be surprised at this flexibility, but many of our customers need this kind of bridge too. The Web is growing at a feverish pace, you can't be in a position where you have to turn away growth.<p>

Bottom-line: This is why it's good that Zope is getting XML-RPC.<p>
