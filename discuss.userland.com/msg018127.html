I disagree.  Or rather, I'd say that Napster facilitates copying which in turn facilitates the *sale* of music.<p>

I spoke with my sister the other day, and she told me what she has been listening to lately.<p>

I downloaded most of the music that night via Napster, liked it, and the next day, ordered 5 CD's from Amazon.
