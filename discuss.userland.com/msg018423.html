Yes, though I'd offer the suggestion of some sort of moderation. By committee, by "chosen" individuals, I don't know. I just wouldn't want to see things degenerate into another Usenet (I love usenet, but the signal-to-nose ratio due to anonymity all but kills it for me).<p>

I'm against censorship.  I'm for <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/flameResistancePolicy">flame-resistant communities</a>.  I don't know that they can happen where complete anonymity and chaos are allowed.  And yes, that does make me sad.<p>
