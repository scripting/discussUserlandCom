Some thoughts:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Running Frontier under WINE: I have had little success.  Because Wine is 3.11 compliant (I think), it doesn't really handle the non-8.3 filenames that Frontier can handle.  As such, it chokes when trying to find frontier.root.<p>

<LI>Running Frontier under VMWare: This should work fine. VMWare is an abstraction layer, or virtual machine. You can 'install' other operating systems on the virtual machine (a directory on the Linux FS), and actually run Windows 95,98,NT, x86 Solaris, and other Linux distributions in a window.  If it crashes - well, it was just a UNIX thread anyway, so restart the process! However, it is pokey unless you're running a 400 MHz box with 128 MB of RAM.  More is better when running an OS in an OS...<p>

<LI>Citrix Client to an NT server, or something similar: You could run a client to an NT server on the Linux box, and have all of the machines on the same UNIX FS.  This way, you could code on Frontier on the NT machine, 'publish' to the UNIX FS, and then compile on the Linux machine.  This is more expensive than suggestion two, however, as it requires an NT server, plus the Citrix server and client software.
</UL><p>

(These are just a few possibilities that come to mind... you probably have already thought of them)<p>

If you just want an outliner to edit in, check out the GTK and QT toolkits; they might have widgets like the 'flipping triangles' in Frontier.  It might make a good class project - write an outlining editor using the widgets from one of these toolkits for Linux.  The class might get into it, and it would provide a nice little editor for people who want to jot down outlines under Linux.<p>

Whew. If any of that is useful, I'm happy.  If not, well - how expensive is drive space these days?<p>

Later,
Matt</li></li></li>
