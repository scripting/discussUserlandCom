Why give a review to Apple when Epinions is there? Why send a card thru Apple when Blue Mountain Arts is funkier and more fun? Why post something on Apple's website if your cousin who uses a Dell can't post a response, or even read it?"<p>

I don't think iReview is limited to Macs, actually. And I think that some people will like Blue Mountain Arts better, while some people will like Apple's iCards better. There's nothing wrong with providing people with multiple choices, after all... if nobody ever challenged the market leader, where would we be?<p>

I don't really care about the home page builder, I don't really care about the mac.com email, and I don't really care about the KidSurf thing. I do really like the iDisk, since it's the easiest "internet disk drive" implementation I've seen for the Mac. But that's just me.<p>

Maybe this'll all pan out for Apple, maybe not, but after watching a zillion people swoon over candy colored desktop iMacs I'm sure not going to attempt to out-predict Steve Jobs and the Apple marketing department.
