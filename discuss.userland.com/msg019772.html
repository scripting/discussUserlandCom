Guess what, Dave - we're all human (ok, so I know you already know that).  I think that's part of what makes weblogs <i>a good thing</i>. As for you in particular, a good part of what draws people to Scripting News, to this discussion group, and eventually to your products is the personality you do show. You are part of your own success, dude, don't sweat it.<p>
