If you can make it to DC, it will be your way to say you are against the bombing of civilians, hospitals, marketplaces, and embassies by a bunch of governments obsessed with their "credibility" (i.e. showing how tough they are).<p>

If you can't make it to DC, there will probably be a west coast protest as well, maybe in SF, and it would be great to see hundreds of silent, small, public candlelight vigils for the civilian casualties of NATO bombing, Serb troops, KLA terrorism and the whole ridiculous affair.
