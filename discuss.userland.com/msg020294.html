Creators must be supported, in a way that makes sense under the prevailing economic system.<p>

Creative product is - by the nature of how human beings are wired - 
usually at its most valuable when it's at its newest.  In the mind
of this creator, it's at its most valuable just before it's finished.  After that I've gotta release and maintain and, yes, sell the 'product'.  Which is a real drag compared to the pure joy I derive from creating it. (Which is why I'm not a millionaire yet)<p>

I just bought a new novel today. Over $20.00, hardback. It's not
available online. The author's last novel in the series, in paperback, can be had for far less than that. Novelty. That's
the beauty of charging for one's time and charging by the subscription model. Novelty is what's being supported in these models.  Subscribe to Wired or Stephen King stories and you get
new stuff from time to time or you let the subscription drop.<p>

There is still a use for the gift economy in this world-view.
Give things away once their value drops below a certain threshhold.
Or in emergencies. Or, heck, because you want to.<p>

Obviously, this doesn't work for everything. <p>

But at the same time, <i>in the current economic and social systems</i>,
giving everything away to everyone, all the time, makes no sense.  There are still relatively few people making their living from giving away software (or art) and not worrying about the economics.<p>

And restricting someone from profiting from a gift isn't right either. Say I give you a drawing I made. You sell it to a friend for $10.00. I can't come after you for one cent of that $10.00.<p>

But a totally fair system would give me a piece of that $10.00,
automatically.<p>
