They aren't about all the details of making a working version of the idea. If they were, someone with a different implementation wouldn't have a problem. If Priceline implemented their business model with Java Servlets, I could come along and build a similar business with ASP and I wouldn't have a problem. But no, Priceline takes a pretty basic idea and says it belongs to them. I don't have a problem with patents that really do take serious development and innovation. But when someone patents the kind of ideas that I come up with when I'm driving, I get kinda upset.
