When I'm writing this, it's about two weeks since I released
our XML-RPC implementation for Python.  Since that, I've received
a considerable amount of mails from people who has put it into
real work within hours from downloading the code.<p>

XML-RPC is like HTTP/1.0 -- anyone can understand it, it can be
used from all major scripting environments, and we're not even
close to seeing the true limitations of the protocol.<p>

If I were in charge, I'd suggest a moratorium: don't even
discuss changes to the protocol until a certain point in the
future, say six months from now.  What's out there now works,
so let's use it.
