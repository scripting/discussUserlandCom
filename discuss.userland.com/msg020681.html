Also I think illustrated by your furby example.  No exchange happens when both parties do not/cannot voluntarily enter into the exchange.  When I run out of furbies, and making more is something I cannot do, then I won't be able to enter into the exchange.  And of course, scarcity in this sense is the basis of negotiation.  Either party could refuse to exchange, thus making the benefit that the other person wants be "scarce".  The guy making furbies runs into a scarcity of dollar bills if he can't produce fast enough.  But you make a great point that he runs into a scarcity of dollar bills if he produces too *fast* as well.  That's what IP is about.  If I make something that everybody wants, I should get to choose if I give it to them or not.  When they pay my price and I hand over the thing that they want, we have two happy people.  When I work my butt off and get paid nothing, I go do something else and we leave that well undrilled for awhile.
