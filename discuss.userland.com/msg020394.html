We both want to write using Radio UserLand for each others' servers. I want to do a weblog on a Zope server, and Paul wants to do one on a Manila server. We call this project "Golden Spike", we've wanted to connect our worlds for a long time, now it seems closer than it's ever been.</i><p>

Gee, looks like I'm going to have to ship my code!<p>

You're going to want templating, of course, and I could build that in.  But I think the best route would be to describe how I did it, and let the DC guys figure out the best way to roll it in.<p>
