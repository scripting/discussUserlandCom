(I wonder what other Frontier users think.  "Survey says"!)<p>

Of course, MDI has it's place -- but my time with Frontier on the Mac skewed me in that direction -- I liked that mode of working better.<p>

Visual Basic (Windows) lets you choose MDI or SDI -- I always choose SDI.<p>

Anyway, I'd love it if MDI was optional.  If it was, perhaps you wouldn't need to embed the HTML control so deeply, strengthening your connection with the browser would be an option.<p>

Dave, I can send you a screen shot of what VB looks like in MDI and SDI modes if you want to see how it does it.<p>

I would also appreciate anyone who likes MDI telling me why -- real examples of how it can be useful/better... I'd like to understand how people on the other side of the fence rationalize this issue.<p>
