If you have a DG, openToPublic is set to false for the associated member group, you are already a member, and you are trying to get your password because you forgot it, you can't.  At least it didn't work for me! :-)<p>

It gives the error about there already being a member with that name.<p>

I would have expected that regardless of whether you are on a public or private DG, you'd be able to get your password via email if you forgot it.<p>

I needed to modify mainResponder.members.sendMail to work around this problem.<p>

Bug?  Or my misunderstanding of how things should work by default?<p>
