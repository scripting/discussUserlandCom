According to the <a href="http://entertainment.yahoo.com/astrology/today/aquarius.html">Yahoo Astrology</a> department:  <br>You may not know whether to zig or to zag today. Restlessness is something that won't go away until you find a way to relieve the stress. The behavior of those you love could be especially upsetting now. Be prepared to lose track of expected funds. Avoidentertainment, investments, and all gambles. Everything that could go wrong will go wrong. Murphy's Law may be superseded by Sullivan's Law, which says that Murphy was an optimist. A sense of humor helps.
