Come to think of it, perl is your friend.  Well, that and frontier.  Perl is a glue language, it bridges gaps and ties systems together. In general purpose, it's really a lot like frontier.<p>


What I'd do is have a perl script as an executable file (chmod a+x file) that took a data file as an argument (or anything really) <p>

Basically the workflow would be<p>

spectrometer -> data file<p>

spectrometer calls 'perlscript "datafile"' as it's shell command<p>

Then your perl script would massage the data and use the xml-rpc module that I think exists to call frontier and have frontier deal with the data.<p>

Use a minimal httpd implementation to pass any recieved call to a perl script for translation tell the spectrometer to do what needs to be done.<p>
