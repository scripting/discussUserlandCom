A point too often overlooked. There are others in line to wear the crown, Oracle and Sun being two obvious candidates. It wasn't long ago that IBM was the "800 pound gorilla", speading FUD, stifling innovation, that everyone loved to hate.<p>

>>PS: To women baseball fans, as with women Linux people, I send my respect. I write as a man sometimes. I don't think enough men do this. There are a lot of women writing about what it means to be a woman. There are even women who write about what it means to be a man! So from time to time I drop gender neutrality, knowing that this is exclusionary, but I have a purpose, to be an example for myself and other men. There's nothing wrong with expressing a male point of view. Thanks for listening.>><p>

Well said. Right on!<p>
