No special custom scripts that manipulate user. I diffed the two frontier.root files (backup and current) and found many differences, most of which had to do with WebEdit. Nothing stuck out as real obvious unfortunately.<p>

Not sure what went wrong, however I have reverted to the backup for the moment. I'll just work up the changes from there, and start a better backup program.<p>
