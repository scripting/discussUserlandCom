I also have to question whether his experience as a POW could possibly taint his political interactions with Asian heads of state, and Asian Americans, were he to be elected President.</i><p>

Which is why I mentioned the fact that he'd been in favor of normalizing relations with Vietnam. Particularly in an election year, I pay a lot more attention to what politicians <b>do</b> as opposed to what they say. Working to normalize relations meant, to me, that his hatred of certain people didn't cause him to be prejudiced against the country.<p>

And if he's not prejudiced against the Vietnamese, I doubt that he's going to bear animus against other Asian countries.<p>

<i>I admire his honesty. But if I interpret his statements as a reflection of his character (I'm still undecided), then he won't get my vote, regardless of his level of honesty.</i><p>

I've already said that there's no chance he'll get my vote in the fall, but his comments in this area aren't the reason why.<p>
