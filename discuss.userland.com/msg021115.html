It depends. The FreeBSD developers would be delighted, but Linus Torvals would get quite annoyed.<p>

But there are actually three separate issues here:<p>

<ul>
<li>Rebranding a software package.</li>
<li>Distributing copies of a software package for money.</li>
<li>Making a software package proprietary.</li>
</ul><p>

The GPL allows the first two, but prohibits the third. For example, RedHat can take a GPL'd window manager, add their logo in several different places, and sell the resulting code as part of RedHat Linux. There's nothing illegal about this.<p>

But here's the catch: A user of RedHat Linux is allowed to <i>remove</i> all those silly logos and to redistribute the original window manager without permission from RedHat.<p>

So there's a happy balance, and nobody gets especially upset. But if RedHat were to add a more restrictive license to the window manager (or an enhanced version thereof), that would be a no-no, and people would get annoyed.<p>

On the other hand, if the window manager used the XFree86 (or new BSD) license, then RedHat could make a proprietary version.<p>

Does this make sense?<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
