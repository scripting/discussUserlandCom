First of all, each notification message still generates email traffic.  If I post a message and a thousand people respond (each waiting long enough for the notification timeout to run and send me mail) then I'll get a thousand useless bits of mail.  Worse, the first person to respond will get 999 bits of mail and so on.<p>

I think it is important to understand that there is something very compelling about ones Inbox.  I read several web pages each day but my inbox (with its client side notification) is always open and the most fundemental tool I use.<p>

IE 4 introduced the ability to get mail notification when a particular url is updated.  However, it has no magic for inserting messages into your inbox, it just sends mail so the traffic issues are still a potential problem.<p>

There is certainly lots of room for some interesting software here.<p>
