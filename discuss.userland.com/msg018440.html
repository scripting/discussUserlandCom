That's right. It's very close to working with actual folders and files. If you want a file available at /sub1/sub2/sub3/file, you need to create folders named sub1, sub2, and sub3. Same thing here, you need to create categories.<p>

(Note to Dave: to clear up some confusion -- Christoph's problem was in using Manila's siteStructure feature, not in the the xml SiteTree feature Matt and I have been discussing.)
