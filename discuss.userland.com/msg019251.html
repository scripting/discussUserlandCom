1) How will anyone differentiate your purchases as part of a buycott from regulr sales? A cash register is not the most intuitive of instruments.<p>

2) Any increase in sales after the Napster ban will be used by the RIAA as justification for their actions. You'll simply be doing them a favour.<p>

If you want Dead tunes buy some bootlegs instead.
