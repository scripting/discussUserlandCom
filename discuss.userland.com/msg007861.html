In general, I agree. However, the market carries more weight with developers than I do. Witness the dismal sales and/or failures of Microsoft Write, OpenDoc, Nisus Compact, and a host of others. I suspect this even affects "Works" applications-- how many copies MS Works, ClarisWorks, are sold at RETAIL, e.g. NOT pre-bundled with a new PC. Which consumer will choose a "crippled" product when they can have "more power" and "industry standard" tools for a bit more $$? Which company's I.T. group or Purchasing Dept would prefer ordering multiple small apps over one monolithic app? I am sad to say that nearly all moderately sized companies will prefer a single, sluggish, bug-ridden app than deal with the idiosyncacies of Swiss Army Knives.
