I've been reading your rants for years, I enjoy your passion, and 
candor, even when I disagree with your conclusions.  I wanted to say
thanks for writing, and to include you in a little holiday tradion of
mine.  Every year I write a song for the season, (this year's is pretty Christmas specific, but I trust listeners will find "christmas" in their own experience and with thier own traditional flavors)<p>

This year's song is on line:<p>

Hope you like the song, please feel free to share with any else you
think might enjoy it.  <p>

Love, joy, and warmest regards,<p>
