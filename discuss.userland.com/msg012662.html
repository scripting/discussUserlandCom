Glad to hear it! With AOLserver now open source, perhaps we'll see greater coverage and use in the media, and hopefully the (equally open source) ACS will likewise benefit.<p>

It's understood that the discussion was about Spectra and Zope--however, when anyone asks me these days what the least costly, fastest, and most powerful way to get to blogging, content management, dynamic publishing, and XML is, I point them to Frontier. But I know you know this.<p>

And certainly no offense taken in these quarters; I just wanted to ensure that you were aware that ArsDigita does, in fact, document/support the ACS pretty aggressively!
