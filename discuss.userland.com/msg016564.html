With enough connections, almost any low end machine should be able to saturate any connection < t1.<p>

I know that changing the # of outbound connections on an EIMS server from 5 to 50 drastically changed performance on an 10k member announcement list that I deal with. There were something like a day's worth of backlog on this machine until the change.  (I'm not sure if 5 is the default. The 50 number came from increasing the # of threads till the connection saturated, then we called it good. )<p>

There is probably a setting in sendmail for the # of outbound connections. (given that there's a setting in sendmail for anything.) At a 0.1 load average and sendmail, I'd bet that you don't have many concurrent processes. <p>
