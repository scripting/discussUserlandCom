With it installed, if you right-click on a directory or other object (like the START button) which has a subsidiary structure, this is one of the choices in the top part of the menu along with "explore" and "open" and "find" and so on. A new window appears with explorer running in double-pane mode.<p>

Though it is tagged as being for Win 95, in fact it works under NT 4 and can be installed there safely.<p>

You can get it from here:<p>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/default.asp</a><p>

by downloading the power toys and then extracting just that one tool from the whole and installing it manually.
