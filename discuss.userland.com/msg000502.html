Part of the problems is getting employees to visit the site.  I must admit that when I opened my browser, the company site was about 149th on the list of my top 150 sites to visit. :-)  <p>

The way they took care of this, is they stopped ALL email announcements.  :-)  When vacation schedules, timecard, PTO tracking was all put ont he web it made people more inclined to visit.  One thing that is essential is to make the very first page a "Whats New".  This will allow people to not spend more time than they have to at the site, since most information there will be stuff they already know.  <p>
