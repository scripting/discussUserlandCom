I'd rather have a change to the reading paradigm!<p>

The combination of Frontier-as-webserver and a modern browser gives me huge power over my desktop. What I See Is What I Want (WISIWIW). Subscriptions, XML or otherwise, definitely play a part, but there's much more to it.<p>

Here's a screenshot of my personal portal:<p>

To-Do list management is one possibility. I could run Frontier as a mail server too, and put all my mail thru the browser. And FTP directory listings updated every few minutes. Anywhere I can get a feed from.<p>

But the point is that the display is at least as important as the source/format of the information. And Frontier makes that possible with bells on.<p>

Yeehaa!
