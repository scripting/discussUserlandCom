It also stands in marked contrast to many of the other things that you've written on this topic recently.<p>

I'm not going to try to render an opinion on 'who started it'. It's irrelevant. What is important is that the flaming (as I defined it earlier) stop.<p>

As to the 'ownership' of RSS, it seems to be a moot point now that you've publicly relinquished it.<p>

I have a certain fondness for end-user formats myself. Tim (somewhere upstream) suggests that there's no reason that the additional functionality couldn't simply be ignored by those that don't want to use it. Is that technically feasible?<p>

Please point to where Tim states you had nothing to do with RSS, I'm afraid I can't find it.
