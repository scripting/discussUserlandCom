It's too complex, there are too many ways of doing things, there's too much of a choice in user interfaces, and now there are arrogant idiots in Unixland. If I haven't been a long time listener, I would jump to the conclusion that you were a paid spreader of MS FUD. But that would be incorrect based on your history. Instead, I'll just say you must have been mightily flamed and annoyed.<p>

There are arrogant idiots anywhere. They should not be considered a factor. As proof, let's assume there are Windows geeks who are arrogant idiots. Have they undermined the power of Windows to become an end-user operating system? This is not a factor. I won't apologize for them. Please ignore them.<p>

The other reasons you give can be considered strengths.<p>

Regarding the spreading of viruses by email, while you question Gosling's statement on the front page of your site, the discussion thread has I think clearly pointed out that Unix is inherently more virus-resistant than Windows. So the thread turns to the ability of novice users to protect themselves when using the internet.<p>

Giving novice users Windows and putting them on the internet is similar to giving drivers with a shiny new learner's permit the keys to a car without an air bag or insurance. Chances are, nothing will go wrong. But. The extraordinary interrelatedness of Windows software that Microsoft has succeeded in delivering makes Windows-Outlook-Office-IE easier to use, easier to use without thinking, and easier to use incorrectly. Melissa is NOT as big a problem with Eudora as it is with Outlook, I believe. I wonder if cruise control has ever been linked to increased highway accidents?<p>

Your strengths are my weaknesses. Unix's complex permissions and user system comes from it's roots on the network, and it doesn't look easy-to-use on the desktop. Windows comes from the desktop and it should be clear is only trying to be a quality network-oriented OS.<p>

As you already know with your Frontier-Linux/Zope experiments.<p>

Anyway, I know you are not a spreader of MS FUD. You should update the front page of Scripting News -- the door is not wide open, Gosling was right.
