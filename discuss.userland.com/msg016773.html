MS threatened to ship Office because of Quicktime's threat to Windows. Apple supposedly trumped that threat with evidence of MS stealing intellectual property from Apple, and the resulting settlement was a cash payment to Apple (this is aside from the $150M investment) and a deal that Apple would excommunicate Netscape from the Mac family. <p>

The goal here is NOT Office for Linux as we see it. This is a LONG TERM solution - 5-10 years out is where you look. Consider Office for BeOS, or for Mac OS X/Intel, Linux/Easel, hell maybe even AmigaOS. And consider a new Office competitor in these spaces and Windows as well - one which is as tightly integrated as Office is at the time. <p>

Here's a billion dollar idea for someone (probably Adobe, but preferably Apple). Create a word processing suite that uses PDF as it's primary document format. Every file is easily catalogued and indexed with existing tools, every file is a web-native file (viewable in any browser), every file fits into existing workflow solutions and can even be the native file format for PS Level 3 printers (no driver issues!). It has built-in security features, compression, and is an open format.
