In the last week I've reviewed two books, written the foreword for one, and in both cases the books are on Amazon, but I'm supposed to keep them secret. I've played along, but it doesn't seem right that the books already have a public existence, so aren't a secret, but I have to pretend that they are. One of the books won't be published until Aug 13, according to Amazon.<br><br><a href="http://www.ecompany.com/articles/mag/0,1640,11261,00.html">eCompany</a>: "Steve Ballmer suddenly rotates his burly right shoulder, driving a meaty fist deep into the green Naugahyde couch at a point about 12 inches from his visitor's kneecap.

Create a customized super-hero out of any of the following: XML, HTTP, UDDI, WSDL, RDF, SOAP, Jabber, Jxta, XML-RPC, RSS. What logo would your super-hero wear? What kind of a shield? Maybe your super-hero would look like a <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/buddha.gif">Buddha</a>, with a big belly and a relaxed grin? Maybe your super-hero would be a beefed-up <a href="http://yahoofin.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-1923494.html">Jim Allchin</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.fortune.com/fortune/1999/02/15/bil.html+bill+joy+picture&hl=en">Bill Joy</a>?

What does all this have to do with the Web? That's a serious question. To me, the Web is about brain-dead simplicty at the expense of functionality. User interfaces of the 1980s were far richer, even in a limited environment like Hypercard, than the Web. The Web trades off all that richness for developer simplicity. The platform-specific RPC mechanisms were also much more complex. The Web cleans it all up. <br><br>Apple: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/IAC/IAC-94.html">Introduction to Apple Events</a>. <i>Macintosh.</i><br><br>Microsoft: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/DCOM.asp">Distributed Component Object Model</a>. <i>Windows.</i><br><br>OMG: <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/corbaiiop.htm">CORBA</a>. <i>Unix.</i><br><br>Just for fun: <a href="http://animutation.mixnmojo.com/anim/pika.htm">Hyakugojyuuichi</a>. <i>Flash.</i><br><br><a href="http://w3future.com/weblog/2001/04/28.html">Sjoerd Visscher</a>: "Why didn't these simple solutions become popular before the web?"

But as systems evolve they get more complex. Then a new generation comes along, forgets everything we once knew, and all of a sudden things are simple again. It's the breathwork of technology.<br><br>Look at the stuff that gets left <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macos8/Legacy/legacy.html">behind</a>. Did you bet on one of these? You have to be careful where you make your investments, or learn the hard way, that sometimes things don't turn out as many think they will.<br><br>
