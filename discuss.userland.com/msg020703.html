That's what I am saying.  I was twisting #3 a bit to say, why the hell would I create anything you could use if I know you are going to steal it?  If I have a farly good guarantee that most people will find it easier to pay me than to steal, I produce stuff that makes lots of people happy.

Once again, I say that the introduction of ever more efficient distribution mechanisms does not change things.  That's a good thing for IP, not a bad thing.
