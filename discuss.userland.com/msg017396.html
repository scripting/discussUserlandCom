Amsterdam was built on the delta where the river meets the sea. (an excellent port location) - but it's swampy - so they drive piles into the ground and build on those - so you can't have anything too tall and heavy, otherwise you'd have sinkage. If you ever need experts in water engineering - just ask the Dutch. If the icecaps keep melting, they're going to be the world class experts in saving coastline properties.
