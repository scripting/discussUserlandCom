to communicate.<p>

I need a browser that let's you view the source of the
page it displayed. <p>

For example, Netscape 3 does this but Netscape 4
does not. Suppose a CGI fails for some reason and you want to
debug the resulting html. The Netscape 4
browser tries to re-execute the CGI when you tell the
browser to "view source". Netscape 3 displays the source
that is currently in the browser window. The latter, Netscape 
3, method is much more useful. In fact, for debugging purposes
I continue to use Netscape 3 for this exact reason.<p>

Thanks.
