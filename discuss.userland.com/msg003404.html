Dynamic outlining. What if each user had a copy of Frontier 6 (Workstation?), and logged onto the Technography Server, also running Frontier.<p>

Once logged in, the server stores IP address/domain/whatever, than as Bernie works on his outline, a callback sends out an XML-RPC call to each client, and the client responds by reloading the outline from the server. If these machines are on an intranet (most logical place for Technography), updating would be pretty snappy.<p>

Could this facilitate some of your ideas, Bernie?<p>

<i>Addendum</i> : You could also (oh this is cool) send images out to the clients, via the same mechanism, causing the user's copy of Frontier to load the image in a browser. (Whiteboard pics, whatever.)
