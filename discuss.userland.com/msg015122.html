Thanks for the attention paid to the important 
South Carolina primary.<p>

Thanks also for the link to "McCain's Navy".<p>

Back when I was last standardly-politically-active,
30 years ago in college trying to stop the war, the
big problem was that the rich and powerful were the
folks who could afford to pump their messages out.
Our little ragtag crews couldn't. <p>

The web changes all that.<p>

My rule-of-thumb has been that it used to take about 10x
more $$$ to convince folks they should eat
shit-on-toast rather than gourmet health food. <p>

No more. All ideas can now flow. Tools like Manila
facilitate that flow. Homage. Abe and George and
Thomas and Tom would LOVE IT.<p>

Stan
