<b>News Sites</b><p>

I get my Linux news from the following sites. They're not exactly weblogs, but they're certainly more adult-oriented than Slashdot:<p>

<a href="http://lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a>: A good, unbiased web site with a <a href="http://lwn.net/daily/">daily news feed</a>. They don't publish very much editorial content, but their news stories are careful and fair.<p>

<a href="http://freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</a>: Software releases with the occasional editorial. I love seeing the new software scroll by. :-) Unfortunately, they've been suffering from server glitches for the last few days.<p>

You can find lots of weblogs on the Linux Weekly News site. Look in the lefthand column of their <a href="http://lwn.net/daily/">daily news page</a>.<p>

<b>Weblogs</b><p>

Some individual developers have weblogs, too. RedHat has one on the <a href="http://www.labs.redhat.com/news.shtml">RHAD site</a>. <a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/diary/">Alan Cox</a> and <a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/~telsa/Diary/diary.html">his wife</a> have matching pair of weblogs.<p>

Browsing though these weblogs, I noticed something curious. Most open source developers talk about code, not about politics. Hmm. ;-)<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
