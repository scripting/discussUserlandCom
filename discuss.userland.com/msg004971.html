You would probably have to modify console.root quite a bit. And maybe you would need to clone the mainResponder.news rpc-handlers and modify them to work with your system. If you are willing to do some digging, you should be able to create a custom system, building on what we released.<p>

If you start to work on something like this, please let me know...
