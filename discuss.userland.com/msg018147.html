What the industry needs to develop is an authentication mechanism for digital media if they wish to retain copyright control. It needs to be cheap, iron-clad, and hard as hell to crack open.

<p>While they're at it, they should come up with an air filter that just lets cool air through, leaving the faster-moving molecules on the other side of the filter.  It would make this summer so much more pleasant.</p>
<p>Let's say I get an Aretha Franklin album in some allegedly-uncrackable digital format.  Regardless of the format, at <i>some</i> point between the album and my ear, the song has to be converted into an analog audio signal.  I can run a cable from my stereo's "audio out" jack to my sound card's "audio in" jack, and with the appropriate software, I can turn that signal into an unencumbered digital audio file, in my format of choice.</p>
<p>Of course, there'll be some noise from the analog transmission, but if I just play the same song over the wire a few dozen times and then average out the results, I can reduce the damage caused by the noise.</p>
