Seasons, the position of the earth relative to the rest of the universe, our bodies change as they age, so do our emotional and intellectual bodies.</i><p>

Yeah, things change constantly, and the really big challenge is to see this as natural and grasp some inkling of what will happen next.<p>

This is why I'm often so dismayed many folks pursue some one true way, because this is so far from a more useful appreciation of change.  A firm belief in static truth can really impede a better grasp of dynamic truth.<p>

I feel most at one with the world when I know what's going to happen next, even when this is through a veil of change.  Nothing else makes me feel nearly as clever.  Paying homage to any one unchanging idea never gives me a similar thrill.
