Reading the online help for this particular feature made my head spin and I'm not sure I can make it any more clear, but here goes.  Say for example I have a folder "foo1" containing the folder "foo2".  If I access this from my website it would be something like www.mysite.com/foo1/foo2/. Now, for whatever reason, I want the content to come from /foo2/foo2.  <p>

<ul>
<li>To accomplish this, I simply click on the properties tab of foo1 from within the IIS MMC and select "Directory".</li>
<li>Find "When connecting to this resource..." and select "A redirection to URL".</li>
<li>Simply type in your new url followed directly by the Redirect Variable "$S".  In my hypothetical case, the URL looks like "http://www.mysite.com/foo2$S", but it could just as easily be an URL on a different server like "http://www.myfancynewsite.com/foo2/somewhereelse$S"</li>
<li>Make sure that you check the box labeled "The exact URL entered above" and if it is to be a permanant redirect, the appropriate box.</li>
</ul><p>

That shoud do it.  For more information on the Redirect variables, click on the Help button when you are in this tab of the MMC.
