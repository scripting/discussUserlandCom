I (and everybody else visiting the BizTalk site !!) am working with them just now (Dan Rogers mainly) on the BizTalk site to develop an offline message reader (_it has just started_) similar to what you have done with XML RPC.<p>

What they are going for first will really be nothing like the XML RPC methods we have used, but will use the BizTalk framework, XSL etc..<p>

However, I am going to write a COM component for SOAP (when I get 5 mins) and maybe later this can be integrated. This has all happened this week, so I am still trying to read the thousands of pages of docs.<p>

This seems like an area of commonality though doesn't it? Have a look at the discussion forum at www.biztalk.org (choose the communiry tab and then Community Projects) to see what has been proposed.<p>

I agree with the people at BizTalk (and SOAP) that they are "complementary technologies", but why not exploit this? We could have a completely generic news reader which could work with any other (including yours !?). <p>

Cheers
Steven
