Their latest, "Namahana", is just as tasty, and pretty much follows the same format, alternating acoustic instrumentals and vocals. They probably have a larger following on the US mainland than in Hawai'i.<p>

Thanks for the plug for Hawaiian music. it reminds me that the only RIAA-affiliated artists are the slack key artists on the Dancing Cat label, and unfortunately (in this situation) some of their acts are good friends of mine.<p>

Another suggestion would be anything by <a href="http://www.kealiireichel.com">Keali'i Reichel</a>, who is the biggest selling and most honored Hawaiian musician of the past decade. He and his manager own their own label.<p>

If anyone else wants to try some Hawaiian, check my website, <a href="http://www.nahenahe.net/">http://www.nahenahe.net/</a> <p>
