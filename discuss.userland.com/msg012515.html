I read this as an attempt at informal scenario-based design which is a technique with a solid pedigree in HCI (<a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/journals/tois/1992-10-2/p181-carroll/">http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/journals/tois/1992-10-2/p181-carroll/</a>), and which I have some background in (<a href="http://ijhcs.open.ac.uk/erskine/erskine.html">http://ijhcs.open.ac.uk/erskine/erskine.html</a>).  <p>

Our research suggests that the "mythological random reader" isn't a useful place to start, rather you need to start with identified (potential) users and preferably ask them to construct scenarios of how they would ideally use a site to accomplish goals.  Alternatively developers themselves can take on an identified persona and write scenarios that way.<p>

The next step is to make claims about things identified in the scenario.  This should usually be a formal process (i.e. write scenario, make claims - not intermix the two), but people do it informally all the time, and most web designers have some kind of internal narrative going on in their head like this a lot of the time.  The technique formalizes that process.<p>

Actually, I'm considering creating a mainresponder app that does this.<p>

There's a Netscape developer article that talks about scenarios, but I can't find it right now -- wasn't that good anyway since it still insisted on task and content analysis, which is unnecessary if you do your claims analysis correctly.<p>

Here's <a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/moderator-guide/requirements.html#scenario">an IBM article</a> that has a lot in common with our article (so much so, we wondered where they got some of it from).
