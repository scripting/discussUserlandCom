A common homemade trap around here (northern Idaho):<p>

Get a gallon plastic milk carton. Cut a hole near the top, opposite the handle. I don't know if there's an optimal size, but I've seen pretty big holes.<p>

Now, hang a single hot dog on a string hanging down from the top. Pour a little bit of beer in the bottom of the carton, and hang it somewhere. It's not terribly attractive, but I have seen such contraptions catch their share of yellowjackets.<p>

Personally, I just spring for a commercial yellowjacket trap.....
