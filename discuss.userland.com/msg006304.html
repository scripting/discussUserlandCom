As an example, let's say I buy some great new widget, which comes with a Linux driver, pre-compiled as a module (which it should, since I don't want to go through the hassle of compiling a driver). When I upgrade to a later kernel version, I want to be <i>absolutely sure</i> that the driver will continue to work.<p>

(Granted, Windows and MacOS aren't this compatible (I noticed a bunch of stuff that broke under MacOS 8.6), but overall they're pretty good. And why shouldn't Linux strive to be better than Windows and MacOS?)
