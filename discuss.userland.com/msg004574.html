Yup I sure do. I screwed up, it was posting to the wrong page. In the earlier version, the registration page was default and now it's register. I was sending the POST request to a page that wasn't listening for the post, so no registration was possible until <a href="http://my.userland.com/register">it was fixed</a> a few minutes ago.<p>

When you submit the page it doesn't get added to the channel list until a human being has reviewed it to make sure the channel looks OK. Then it gets approved and shows up. No need to send me an email when you submit something, the server does that automatically.<p>

So please try again, sorry for the screwup.
