We suffered tremendously in the March-early April outage, it came at a terrible time, and we were just about back to normal, and then the <a href="http://static.userland.com/misc/conxionLetter.txt">stupid letter</a> came and threw all our cards in the air. We have to have a good connection to the net or we're out of business. The ISP behaved in a very anti-customer way. Their behavior as a company has been exemplary in every way except this one. Unfortunately this letter ends the relationship, not much room to negotiate here.<p>
