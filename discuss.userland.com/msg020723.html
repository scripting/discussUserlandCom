This may be a purely semantic nitpick, but when I have my car serviced I'm not buying <b>effort</b>.  I'm buying <b>skilled labor</b>.<p>

I'm sure the kid next door would be happy to expend a lot of sincere effort on repairing my brakes, but I'm not interested in paying for that effort.<p>

I know the guys down at East Hennepin Auto will provide skilled labor, which is why I take my car[s] there.<p>

But then, just to argue with myself: The last time I needed brake work, I panicked and took my car into Tires Plus.  They wanted to replace pretty near the whole front end for something approaching $300.  I took the car over to EHA the next morning, and they did what actually needed to be done for under $200.  I suppose in that case I am buying the <b>effort</b> involved in actually diagnosing the problem.
