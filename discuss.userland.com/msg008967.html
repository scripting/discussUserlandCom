"The day I wrote this, Freshmeat carried twenty-two release announcements, of which three appear they might push state of the art in some respect, This was a slow day for Freshmeat, but I will be astonished if any reader reports as many as three likely innovations a month ion any closed-source channel." <p>

Steven Levy on Dvorak: &quot;That Dvorak is a cagey guy who knows recycling.  After the original Mac
came out he gave virtually the same gender-based criticism to it, dismissing not only the industrial design but the idea of using a mouse and pictures as girly stuff.  (I wrote about this in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140232370/o/qid=933546091/sr=2-2/002-8929444-3513822">Insanely Great</a>.) His preference was the IBM AT computer, which he called 'a man's computer designed by men for men.'  Both times he knew that the over-the-top sexism would be controversal and attention-getting.  But it's interesting that his take in the original column was so wrong it can stand beside remarks like 'an individual has no use for a computer.' I wonder how this recent one will stand up.&quot;<p>

Hey! I just <a href="http://www.groksoup.com/wildBeatnikPie/">started</a> a new weblog on <a href="http://www.groksoup.com/">GrokSoup</a>. Not bad. It only too five minutes. They still need to do some more work, I hit a bunch of errors, not like we don't have a few here too. ;->
