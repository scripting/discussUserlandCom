I could be wrong, but the only way to keep open a stream coming from the HTTP server to the client that made the request is with a sendPartial.<p>

The real problem isn't in getting the browser to update this info into a form field, or possibly in a JavaScript controlled <div>, but in being able to manage all of the open pipes.<p>

At what point do you cut the open connection and make the chat user re-initiate? Within the HTTP protocol it's not possible for the server to initiate the connection to the client...
