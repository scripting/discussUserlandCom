You need to write a DLL extension for Dreamweaver. I've been looking at this problem at a lot of different angles and the only really nice way to make Dreamweaver and Frontier live together is to write C code.<p>

Can a DLL talk to the system's TCP/IP stack? can it send COM/AE ? if so the DLL could provide a simple RPC command, and all the intergration work would be in javascript for Dreamweaver, and Usertalk for Frontier.<p>

(Oh- the DLL adds javascript commands to Dreamweaver)<p>

BTW, C++ is way out of my reach right now.
