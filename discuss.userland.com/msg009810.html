If this is the case, then host A (as a client) sends a request to B (as a server).  The request would have a reference (URL) to the "callback" on A.  B (now as a client) would then send its response as a request to A (now acting as a server).<p>

This would be a true "callback" :-)<p>

Thoughts?
