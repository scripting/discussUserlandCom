I have a different approach than the people who work for me. It's my job to cut thru the problems as quickly as possible. And I also have to worry about my people, if they can't get my work done, then they aren't working for you. I believe UserLand's customers are the smartest people in the world. I think they're smart enough to know that I mean them well when I ask why they care about a feature. I want to know the answer. That's why I asked. That's the only reason.<p>

BTW, isn't the new <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$6907">feature</a> cool? Can you imagine that at some time you might want that feature for your users?? It's funny how the complaints always come when we ship something new! (It seems the reverse of what it should be from our point of view.)
