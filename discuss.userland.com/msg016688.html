LOL! I agree. That reminds me of <a href="http://java.sun.com/features/2000/04/emailrad.html">an article</a> I recently read about a company that has put lots of effort into whiz-bang multimedia Java applets which are designed to be mass-mailed (i.e. spammed) to people. They say in the article that they have an opt-in policy. <em>But who would opt-in to such a thing?</em><p>

Whenever I see something like this, I wonder: Are these people totally out of touch with the Net, or am I out of touch with most Net users?<p>

(BTW, VeriSign & Authenticode <em>don't</em> certify that software is safe, just <a href="http://digitalid.verisign.com/developer/help/mscs_intro.htm">that you know who it comes from</a>.)</em></em>
