I understand rules. My comparison to rules was ONLY from the point that depth is associated with a rule, and depth is being associated with the expansion state (a new idea based on <i>my</i> experience with outliners). It was a way to relate the application of a proposed expDepth <i>attribute</i> to something that is already established.
