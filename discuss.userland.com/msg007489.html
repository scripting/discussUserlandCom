Well, that's what RSSMaker does of course, except you don't have to paste anything anywhere. You just need to contact me and I'll add it to the list of sites visited, it would be trivial to add an online form to register. That's probably as simple as it gets. I'd rather not copy my web page into a cgi every time I update it, and for many people that could be quite frequently. my.userland could do something like that as an option. <p>
