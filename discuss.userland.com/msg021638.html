Kabir X:<i>Patents can potentially be used to enforce a usage policy for a given technology.</i><p>

How? That's a very big maybe. This doesn't seem to happen currently.  Why would it?  Also, most of my comments on patents are qualified to refer to software patents.  I can't see how other kinds of patents are relevant in this forum.  Can you think of a software technology you could patent and control for moral reasons?  (I expect folks to mention encryption, but it's too late to control that.)<p>

Kabir X: <i> If patents are to be abolished, then we need a mechanism that allows for the enforcement of the deployment and usage policies
for a given technology.</i><p>

Wait, that begs the question in the first supposition, whether it might even be possible to use patents to enforce usage policies.<p>

My exact words were, "I'm a software patent abolitionist."  I want to abolish software patents, not all patents.  Perhaps I should not have abbreviated the topic subject for clarity.
