I think the web does have a command line: it's the browser's url field. I'm working with an ecommerce package which provides a lot of data to the developer's scripts in the form of an xml structure that functions a lot like Frontier's pageTable. In their model you can add to the data provided to a document just by adding parameters on the url line. I've really begun thinking of each page as a command-line utility, and the browser window as STDOUT.<p>
