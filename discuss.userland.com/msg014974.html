Commercial UNIX machines have had it for a long time (at least the RS/6000 and HP-UX machines I&#180;ve used) and this has never caused an uproar or an e-mail flood to the manufacturers. I definitely think you guys need to cool down. Relax, have a nice cold Corona and surf around. I think there are bigger threats to our privacy than that...<p>

Have fun.
