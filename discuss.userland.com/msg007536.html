In instances where the content is a paragraph with two embedded links, I have to make an arbitrary decision as to what to show people at the top level of this item. <p>

Do I show them the first n words of the item? Do I show them just the links?<p>

If there's a <title> tag for me to read, I can use that. If there isn't, I still have to make the arbitrary decision, but at least when it's there the choice has been made by the content creator, not my dumb program....
