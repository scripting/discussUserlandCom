Most big sites are now using a service like Akamai to serve their big media files (e.g. The Phantom Menace trailer).  To do this, they rewrite their HTML to point to someplace on akamai.net for the embedded media.  For the magic to work, that URL can't change on each request.<p>

BTW, when the magic works, it's apparantly a very cool thing.  Akamai routes the request the disk farm closest to the client, which both reduces backbone load, and speeds up download time.
