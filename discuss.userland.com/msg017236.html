Interesting to note re Brian Behlendorf's <a href="http://weblogs.oreillynet.com/edd/discuss/msgReader$49">query about XML</a>, unless you can use Apache to browse the Web on a Mac, you need a good XML parser somewhere other than Apache.<p>

It gets more ridiculous all the time. Arrogance is considered a substitute for intelligence.<p>

Disclaimer: I like Brian. He's a good guy, that's why I respond to his ridiculous statements. It's like logging a bug in Apache.
