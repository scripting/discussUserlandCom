<a href="http://www.fragdifferent.com/">FragDifferent</a> is a Manila site. <i>Nice!</i><p>

Hey MacWEEK has a <a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/quicklinks/">weblog</a>, and it's a good one. Someone had the (good) idea to register it on the Weblog Monitor. That's how other webloggers find out about you. ";->"<p>

<a href="http://subhonker2.userland.com/weblogMonitor/errors">A new page</a> on the Weblog Monitor site lists all the errors for the day. Sites that were missing due to bad connections, servers down, bugs in our app or acts of Murphy. (Later in the day I added a pref that, if checked, sends you an email when there's an error.)<p>

Today's further developments in Weblog Monitor are described in this <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/weblogs/555.html?">posting</a> to the weblog mail list. <p>

BTW, to Frontier users, shortly after 6.1 ships we'll release the full source of Weblog Monitor. It's a Manila site, all the programmed stuff interfaces thru macros. I edit the site just like any other site. Edit this Page buttons everywhere. This functionality could be used inside large organizations to monitor changes on websites scattered over various divisions. You need more of these kinds of tools as the web grows, or viewed the other way around, having these kinds of tools makes it possible for the web to grow.<p>

Manila-Newbies: <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/discuss/msgReader$220">If you know mainResponder, customizing Manila is easy</a>. "Manila has a very simple programming model if you know how to do mainResponder sites, because that's exactly its programming model."<p>

Leigh Dodds has figured out <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$231">how to</a> get user-customizable appearance in Manila, just using the browser interface, no server-side scripting. <i>Bravo!</i><p>

Here's a <a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.users.uswest.net/~sandez/pharmacy.htm">weblog</a> about pharmacy and family, with great photos.<p>

<a href="http://redirect.userland.com/$http://www.newhomemaker.com/diary/index.html">Lynne Siprelle</a>: "Today I started throwing out my rags, old stale makeup, bottles of essential oils I'd had for 20 years--things I've been hanging on to because I either thought I didn't deserve better or because I was afraid I'd not be able to replace them, even though they were falling apart or too old to use."<p>

He was a political activist with a links page. Real journalists check their stories, seek scoops from all sides, and don't play the games they cover."
