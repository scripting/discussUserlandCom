"Despite the strong consistency in all Mac software do you think Excel looks like MacWrite? Or that there was no design creativity involved in making MORE (a popular outliner)? It's clearly not the case that all GUI software is the same even though most software has pretty strong compliance with the platform design standards these days." <i>I absolutely agree. The Mac UI guidelines of the day covered a small part of the functionality of any app. Yet developers resist standardization, I did too.</i><p>

Heads-up -- Scripting News will not be updated frequently until Wednesday morning. I'm in Monterey at the <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Open Source Convention</a>. I'm on a panel at 2PM (tomorrow!) with Paul Everitt, Guido Van Rossum and Eric S. Raymond. There was a scheduling screwup so I'm relaxing and learning a little about Perl and Python. I just watched the Perl Bowl. It was funny. Also it's funny that I can update the home page from the computer room. Even though there are 50 people in the room, it's silent. All you can hear is clicking of keys. Lots of clicking of lots of keys. Hey I could get used to this.<p>

On second thought I miss my laptop, even though its keyboard doesn't work well. This system is running Netscape on Linux. The clipboard doesn't work right. It refreshes pages when I go back and forward, wiping out what I typed. And it looks cheezy! I miss Windows! I'm going to say that on stage tomorrow. (Probably not.)<p>

PS: I figured out how to use the clipboard.
