It doesn't have to be a horrendous security issue, although it certainly <I>is</I> given the half-assed way most systems have approached security. Ironically, the right answer to the problem--capability-based security--dates to the 1960's but was largely abandoned due to its "impracticality." In spite of this, a large body of existing literature on "the confinement problem" in security exists and remains valid today (i.e. it's worth doing a search on your favorite engine for "security" and "confinement problem.")<p>

In the meantime we have the Web, and the whole question of how mutually distrustful bits of code can be made to cooperate without being forced to become vulnerable. A good starting point for learning about the issues--as well as a very good shot at addressing them on top of the Java virtual machine--can be found at <<a href="http://www.erights.org">http://www.erights.org</a>>.<p>
