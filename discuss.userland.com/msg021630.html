It dates back to the early days of guest databases in Frontier. It predates Manila. As I work on the release of aggregator.root, this is in my face at every step. <br><br>	It's good to do this review, because it reminds me how much we've learned since this code was written.<br><br>	Therefore, I'm rewriting it. Making it simpler and more self-contained. I want to give the working group a good start with clean code that works. <br><br>	So it might be a couple of days. In the meantime, <a href="http://ican.editthispage.com/">Jeff Cheney</a> has volunteered to take custody of aggregator.root, and run a <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/aggregator">mail list</a> for people who want to work on the code. Thanks Jeff, I accept your offer.<br><br>	This is going to be a fork because we're going to keep running the old code on <a href="http://aggregator.userland.com/register">our aggregator</a>, at least for now. I have to stay with the evolution of Radio UserLand, Manila and Frontier. But I want the aggregator to be part of the UserLand community. <br><br><b>Self-documenting XML<a name="selfdocumentingXml">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/22#selfdocumentingXml" title="Permanent link to 'Self-documenting XML' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Teaser: Could a <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss#rssIsAboutSimplicity">courageous format</a> find a new home with a new name? Why not? <br><br>	As they <a href="http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-ita1.htm">say</a> in baseball, it ain't over till the fat lady sings. <br><br>	"I believe XML formats should be designed as end-user software is designed. Hack at the details, make every feature justify itself, reduce every three-step process to one if you can. Do it over and over, and then work on the top level.<br><br>	"I'm like Steve Jobs on this. I think when you lift the hood you should see a beautifully designed machine that invites you to understand and then use it."<br><br>	There's a lot of value in the simplicity of RSS 0.91. It isn't surprising that other working groups would like to join the <a href="http://static.userland.com/myUserLandServices/serviceList4.xml">tree</a> of RSS applications, and bring them into their content flows. <br><br>	The subject of human-readability came up this morning on a W3C mail list. I pointed to the OPML spec, which says its <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/opmlSpec#goalsOfTheOpmlFormat">design goals</a> are to be a "transparently simple, self-documenting, extensible and human readable format that's capable of representing a wide variety of data that's easily browsed and edited." <br><br>	With all due respect to my colleagues in in the W3C, I want to make XML popular, and in order to be popular, it's gotta be easy. Ordinary Web developers should learn something by simply reading the XML file. I want a simple idea to pop into their heads. "I can do that!" Most XMLizations make me want to close the file, quickly.<br><br>
