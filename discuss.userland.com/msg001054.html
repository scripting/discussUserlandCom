A search on "feature" and "request" turned up only the Root Updates page...<p>

The old FullWrite Professional word-processor had a rather nice outliner. One of the features I miss most is auto-numbering of outline items and subitems. I could specify the format of the "numbers" for each level of the outline (e.g. I.A.1.a.i., etc.), and FullWrite would automatically number/letter each item, adjusting things appropriately when I'd rearrange outline items.<p>

I'd love to be able to do this in Frontier's outliner. Having numbers really helps ("Okay, let's discuss item 2A now"), but if I have to put them in by hand, I have to renumber everything every time a new item is inserted, promoted, etc.<p>
