Having five kids (ages 5 to 22) and contact with their peers throughout, there is undoubtedly a far more casual ethical approach than even three decades ago. Lying, stealing and the like are often rationalized, not unlike what some of their parents (us) tend to do, eh?<p>

OTOH, there were posts here a week or two ago re Napster and the music biz on the challenge of redefining "value" in our culture as a prelude to repricing stuff.<p>

The younger set, IMO, is acutely aware and quite sensitive to the wildly unethical (or, at least, inconsistent) distortions of current valuations and goods-and-services pricing by corporate America. Indeed, they are extraordinarily sophisticated about what they are <i>really</i> expected to pay for by their elders.<p>

So, while I agree broadly with you, your son's confusion may be due at least as much to a fuzzier cultural calculus about what 'x' good or service is 'worth' (especially in 'y' format) as it is to ethical decadence.<p>
