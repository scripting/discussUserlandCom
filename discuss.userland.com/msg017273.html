Caveats...it's written by Richard Stallman. Need I say more??? *grin* Stallman (RMS in Net circles) is a HARD-CORE free software evangelist, so be aware of that. He comes at this stuff less from the economic reasons, and more from the social and ethical side of things. So he says some quite contraversial things at times...*grin*, and knows it. But regardless, he's thought through alot of these things rather carefully, and he's a sharp guy. <p>

Slashdot recently did <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/05/01/1052216&mode=thread">an interview </a>with him in which he does a good job of laying out his thoughts on Free Software, his issues with the Open Source Movement, etc. Again, be warned; strong opinions ahead!! *grin*<p>
