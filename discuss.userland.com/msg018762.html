I'm running it now. So far so good. I haven't yet experienced its fastness. I expect that to happen when I run some scripts. Now it just seems like a new empty machine, I have to get all my software set up.<br><br>	As we installed the new machine, I said to Bierman, pointing to stacks of CDs that cost thousands of dollars, "I wish I could just throw these in the trash." Not yet, but sooon, I hope.<br><br>	I also switched to DSL, the T1 is now dangling in space, a safety net in case the DSL is too flaky to use. DSL is slower, but a lot cheaper. It now takes approx 20 seconds for me to save my outline on the server, where it used to take about two.<br><br>	Another difference, I'm running Windows 2000 on my desktop. Unfortunately ImageReady doesn't work on this OS, there's a new release I still have to get. So don't expect new images on Scripting News until that outage clears.<br><br>	BTW, it's a Dell. We eventually made contact with them at a professional level. We had been buying from the "wrong part" of Dell, they said. Now we buy from the right part. I still have no idea what that means, except that when there are problems they fix them. That's all I can ask for I guess, except I wanted the same for Scripting News readers, but they had no idea what I was talking about<br><br>	<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$18825">A very crude</a> benchmark of the performance of the machine, probably only meaningful to Frontier people. <br><br>	As if that wasn't silly enough, here's another <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$18837">crude test</a>.<br><br><b>Today's song<a name="todaysSong">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/20#todaysSong" title="Permanent link to 'Today's song' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Mountain: <a href="http://www.summer.com.br/~pfilho/html/lyrics/m/mississippi_queen.txt">Mississippi Queen</a>.<br><br>	A gritty down-home Louisiana hard rocker. <br><br><b>Today's idea<a name="todaysIdea">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/20#todaysIdea" title="Permanent link to 'Today's idea' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	CD ROM burners at Internet cafes around the world. Napster. Fast net connection. Per-hour fee. Tunes to go.<br><br>	(Now that I'm on DSL I'm coming up with ideas on how to rent bandwidth. I think there may be such a thing as virtual bandwidth. If the net result is I don't wait for something to happen, I can make DSL work for me. I think this is an important point. For this reason I'm glad I have a slower net connection. It'll make my software better. Yeah I already totally hate it. I'm just saying this to try to make me like it more.)<br><br><b>Today's bug<a name="todaysBug">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/20#todaysBug" title="Permanent link to 'Today's bug' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Just so you know, we're working on a music player program. It's got a really neat bug. It's possible to play two songs at once. Right now I'm listening to Hey Jude overlayed on 10CC's I'm Not In Love. I've never heard anything like it. I think I like it.<br><br>	It's even worse than I thought. I had two copies of 10CC running, out of synch with each other. So there were echoes that were hard to pick up. I found this out when I shut down one of the players. There was still a copy playing. <br><br>	<a href="http://www.tactile12000.com/features/index.html">Paul Nakada sent</a> a pointer to The Tactile12000, a "3-D, interactive simulation of a DJ setup - two turntables and a mixer.

(Without the pain.)<br><br>	The first joy is watching the hits come in and wondering who all those people are.<br><br>	In Napster the hits don't come very fast, it takes a long time for most people to download a song. It's cool because you can really ponder who the person is. And even better, you can ask them! (Napster has integrated chat, most web servers don't, a shame.)<br><br>	I recognize this as a meditation I used to do with WebSTAR. I'd sit down in front of the server (it was in a different room) and watch the log scroll, wondering who these people are, coming from so far away, or from powerful companies, reading some obscure howto on the Frontier site, or whatever. It's the other side of writing, watching people surf your site. A very small percentage of us have had the oppty to do this, but what a useful meditation it is.<br><br>	The other cool thing about running a server, that Napster does not address, is the convenience of editing content. On my old Mac server (now long gone) I used to entertain my friends by opening the home page of my site in BBEdit. I'd change a word, press Cmd-S, and then refresh the web browser. "That's easy!" my friend would say, yes, it's almost magical. Instead of 18 steps to update your site, or even 3, it's 1. There's no more convenient way to edit for the Web than to have a server on your machine. Then it's a small matter to have the changes percolate up when you want to disconnect.<br><br>	We're adapting "Pike" to that model now.<br><br><b>Open Source sheltered?<a name="openSourceSheltered">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/20#openSourceSheltered" title="Permanent link to 'Open Source sheltered?' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.camworld.com/">CamWorld</a> reports from the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in Monterey CA. "Surprisingly there is very little extended discussion about Microsoft and their .NET initiative. Part of me chalks this up to it being a very open source kind of crowd who learned a long time ago how to live without Microsoft and their products. Another part of me thinks it's because Microsoft is purposely being very vague about the whole concept and people aren't willing to make any bets on it yet."<br><br>	Cam, I have a different theory. I offered to come talk about Dot-Net. Never got a response. Something else is going on there. My theory is that Open Source is a world unto itself, like the Mac, or Windows, or CORBA; and not open to ideas that come from outside their community. (See Tim Bray's comment, <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/20#timBraysCommentOnOpenSource">below</a>.)<br><br>	There are some great minds behind that firewall, and if it were truly open to new ideas there would be a mission that would tie all the work together in ways with great meaning for users. I had hoped that by now we'd all be working together on such a mission.<br><br>	Cam, please keep the reports coming, try to go a little deeper if you can, ask questions about the larger world, see if there's an idea for what Open Source will mean to users, not just to developers. And if you don't hear it there, my best advice, based on a lot of years in this business, is to broaden your horizons beyond the limits of the Open Source community. <br><br>	PS: I'm sure my friends at Microsoft are having a good chuckle about this. All the time we were developing SOAP I was telling them that I hoped to get the Open Source world to come eat their lunch. Ha ha!
