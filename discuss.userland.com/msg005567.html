Basically you'd render sites from Frontier that contain bits of PHP code. What's really needed is four or five sample sites stored in a Frontier guest database, as examples. Render them statically into the Linux file system, served thru Apache with PHP processing them. That's it. I think that they offer samples with PHP. Let's convert them. We'll set up a server running PHP and Apache and we'll have a lab to play with.<p>

It's really a know-how thing, no technology is needed, I think.
