There is one <a href="http://www.ehelp.com/">company</a> that is clearly trying. These guys make RoboHELP, the writing/authoring tool I use for my online help. They recently changed their name from Blue-Sky to eHelp, added a new swooshy-waving-man logo, and totally overhauled their website to be more portal-ish. They have a very active <a href="http://www.helpcommunity.com/">community</a> and some good resources. It's a start, at least.
