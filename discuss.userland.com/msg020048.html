who, for about a decade before Red Hat bought them,
were profitable making enhancements to GCC and the 
rest of the GNU toolchain and developed new related
products like the Cygwin Unix emulation library for
Windows. The GPL actually helped them make money 
because they charged proprietary developers who
wanted proprietary licenses money while accepting 
contributions from the community. In fact, their 
development was so good that their fork of gcc, egcs,
eventually became the main branch of development. It
is fair to say that business models for free software
are less proven and less well understood than business
models for proprietary software (the same way proprietary
software models were less proven and less understood
in the 1970s when compared to proprietary hardware
models). It is not fair to say that no knows how to
build a sustainable business off of free software.<p>

Personally, my only objection to the GPL does not
come from its effect on proprietary software developers,
which however you slice it is a deliberate choice of 
those who release GPL software, but rather its effect 
on free software developers who choose other licenses 
(like the MPL). I am of the opinion that most free 
software developers would not mind allowing their GPLed
code to be linked to code under other free software
licenses as long as there were adequate safeguards 
to ensure that the resulting binaries were free software
(under whatever license) "all the way through" and 
would not become dependant on proprietary components.
