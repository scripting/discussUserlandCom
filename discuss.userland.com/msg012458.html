That's a user feature. It would do nothing to improve the environment for me. I like the Approve button better. Have you noticed that there's no garbage on My.UserLand? (At least not yet.) That probably has something to do with the fact that I can silently opt out of serving any content I want. So far I haven't had to opt out once. Compared with the crap that shows up here (some of which you never see because I delete it quickly, or it comes to my mailbox), I think the obvious reason is that when I delete a message it's cause for people to go on a hate campaign. If I flip it around and make this a priviledge instead of an apparent right, I bet the quality goes way up.
