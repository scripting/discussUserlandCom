Some might say this is an indication of excellent user interface design. I think some of my design heroes might be proud: Brenda Laurel (a definite sense of dramatic participation in a narrative experience; continuing discovery), Kai Krause (visually rich, custom crafted tools and agents for design, navigation, socializing), Don Norman (affordances, visual clarity). It is inviting and exciting to dive in and explore. I need to give it another two hours to see if the lushness wears thin or just fades into the background. <p>

Flash, by the way, was bundled with both Netscape and IE starting with release 4. <p>

I agree; it is not an especially good writing or composition tool. Like manila, it is strongest today in site framework. <p>

And it looks gorgeous (with appropriate resolution and colour depth) and alive (at DSL/T1 connections).
