I'm interested in aggregate figures for the US economy as a whole, not revenue per book/CD/whatever.  Also, I want to distinguish between, say, the income that a writer receives as a salary from a newspaper and the income that s/he receives as royalties from publishin a book.

When discussing alternatives to the current intellectual property system, having this figure handy would be a useful data point.
