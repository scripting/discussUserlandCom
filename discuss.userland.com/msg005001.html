hmmm...just as fuzzy, there was some sort of limit, but it may have been depths or number of entries.<p>

Either way - those limits aren't there now (or they are very very big)<p>

Not a problem with the range you were talking abou<p>

But there is still a display problem - that is once you get past about 3200(?) entries, the GUI doesn't cope to well, scrolling slows way down, and it may appear that your table stops at a certain point.<p>

However, the entries will still be there - and as long as your accessing them via scripts it won't be a problem.<p>
