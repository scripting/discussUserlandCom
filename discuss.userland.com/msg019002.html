Sure, but it's not hard to succeed in creating client apps for a single platform! And dynamically loading code onto a single platform is no great shakes either.<br> </i><p>

I guess I'm overly focused on delivering Windows apps with good performance, but to this point that's been our market. I've been reviewing Java regularly for the past couple of years, the last time being a month ago. Even now (on a PIII 600) I still find performance of even simple apps to be fairly sluggish. <p>

It's been extremely difficult to find examples of complex apps written in Java (spreadsheets, word processors, graphics programs, etc.) in fact the only representative examples I've found are the Java IDEs themselves. The performance of Forte is scary, JBuilder 3.5 performs reasonably well but is it really "pure Java"? If so why does each platform have a seperate download?<p>

Above all where are the (client-side) killer apps written in Java? Why wasn't Napster written in Java, wouldn't that have made perfect sense? Why did Lotus kill e-suite? How can I commit my company to writing Java apps when established companies don't seem to be doing it?<p>

Frankly I'd love to switch to Java and bask in the glorious feeling that no matter which strange device/OS takes over I can adapt. But where are the real-world examples?<p>
