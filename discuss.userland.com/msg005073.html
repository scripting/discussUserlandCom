What you've just done is taken the current password, then hashed it and put it in a cookie. You're right back to where you started. Unless you can hash on the client, MD5 will not help you.<p>

To use md5 effectively, you need to be able to replicate the pop3 apop command.  The server sends a globally/universally string, typically <unique <a href="mailto:time@machine">time@machine</a> ip/name>. The client then hashes this + the password, and the server compares the hash to it's own hash of the string+password. This is basically impossible to do when you have a human at the web browser. (although it's possible to use for xml-rpc)<p>


Fundamentally, ssl is the better choice, since you get 3 things.<p>

1) authentication<p>

2) protection from snooping<p>

3) protection from spoofing<p>


i.e., you know the other person, you know that no one in the middle can read it, and no one in the middle can change it (in a cryptographically strong sense).<p>
