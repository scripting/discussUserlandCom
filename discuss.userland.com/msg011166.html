I find it more interesting to know why women's groups form, than to know if the reasons are justified or not. I would like to know, and that's why <b>I asked</b> Dori to tell her story. I'll tell you this much, if someone addressed me the way you address her, I would be angry Jacob. Why are you so important? Why do you get to stop the conversation and make demands? What if, instead, you asked Dori to tell you more about her experience, not shove the discussion into a corner that your mind insists is there.<p>

I want to tell you this, what she says is true. It's inside me. I do tend to trivialize the women's role in technology. I found her comments eye-opening because it focused my attention on something that I only pay attention to peripherally. Now, to me, that's much more important than whether she's justified or not. That's how I learn, by learning about *myself*.
