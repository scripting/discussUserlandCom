Kindly ignore.	Subheader 1		This is a paragraph.		This is a second paragraph.				This is a third paragraph, after an empty outline cell.	Subheader 2		And a fourth paragraph.	Hmm... Only takes one level of headers. The rest gets "collapsed".Conclusions	I want to write a "smart" outline renderer which will allow several levels and sublevels of titles, using HTML "h3"," h4", etc. tags. If an outline cell has children, it is assumed to be a section title and is formatted with the appropriate "h#". If it has no children, it is assumed to be bodytext belonging to its parent, and is formatted with "p"..."/p". Shouldn't be too hard.<p><p>
