Unfortunately we've hit a little snag.<p>

Our dev machines went down over the weekend, and when reinstalling IE5 Beta today (even from a folder containing all 43mb of the setup) it demands that it must go to microsoft.com to download a component (maybe a missing component).  When the setup attempts to download from Microsoft, the download fails.  <p>

I figured maybe something's wrong with my setup program and I'll just download a new one.  Only to find that Microsoft seems to have removed IE5 Beta from the site in anticipation of the March 18 final release.<p>

Perhaps this is why my setup failed, or maybe I'm looking in the wrong places?<p>

Does anyone kow if IE5 Beta is still available and how we can continue developing and showing our new IE5 products to our customers until March 18?<p>

Thanks,<p>
