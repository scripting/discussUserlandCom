i needed a card on the other machine badly... solution... fork out for a new card! (well, two actually - the first one had compatability issues, but that's another story)...<p>

fill out the "can't find what you're looking for? - contact us" box, you get...
<h1>NO THANKSPAGE field found</h1>
back...<p>

then the <A HREF="http://static.userland.com/support/email.html">'help us to improve our site'</a> link lets you fill in yer email so as to have the possibility of being randomly picked for a survey!!!<p>

i just fired an e off, guessing the addy as '<a href="mailto:support@'">support@'</a>... let's see what happens...<p>

meanwhile, browsing for the driver i came across this...<p>

"Iomega has decided it will not ship any additional units of the Buz™ Multimedia Producer for the PC to its distribution channels. However, Iomega will continue to support the product — if you buy one you can continue to count on Iomega's outstanding customer support."<p>

sounds like a good mission statement... will try and post chocolate milk's 'actions speak louder than words'  tomorrow...<p>

good night!<p>
