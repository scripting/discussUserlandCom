1. What are the conditions for getting messages to the about window to show up from an agent script?<p>

2. What are the conditions under which an agent may fail?<p>

I am familiar with the idea that the agent that will display its messages is the one chosen from the about window popup. However, I also found that if I enclosed the msg() call in a thread.evaluate() statement I can get it to show up in the message window even if that agent is not chosen from the poup menu. Is there a better way?<p>

Regarding item #2, I have found that under some conditions my agent scripts fail, and I don’t know why. When compiled they run, and they contain a sensible value for the clock.sleepfor() verb. However, sometimes, perhaps when they encounter an error, they will cease to run. Sometimes I have to re-compile them to get them to run again later. What might be going on here? <p>

Thanks for any help….
