It means a lot to me.<br><br>But you wouldn't believe the pushback I'm getting from the last sentence of today's piece from people who write for print pubs. I stand by it. It's called O-P-I-N-I-O-N. Your mileage may vary. It's possible. Maybe.<br><br>BTW, before you flame me, look at the definition of <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=integrity">integrity</a>. I like the third branch. "The quality or condition of being whole or undivided; completeness." <br><br>Integrity is not <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=goodness">goodness</a>, although some people think it is.

Give your friend the programmer a hug, a meal, some fresh air, and listen. Ask how it's going. What do you think of this or that. How could it all work better. Listen. There's a mind in there. Don't be afraid. Programmers can be friendly if you just give them a chance. <br><br>	I had lunch with <a href="http://www.herring.com/index.asp?layout=column_cod_a&channel=80000008">Rafe Needleman</a> of <a href="http://www.herring.com/">Red Herring</a>, outdoors at the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$351">Parkside Grille</a> in Portola Valley. I didn't get a hug, but he did pay. Nice meeting. We talked about dotcoms, writing, the old days (he was reviews editor at InfoWorld in the late 80s) and other stuff. Today the weather was so gorgeous. T-shirt weather. Funky music walking weather. Yeah. Still a hint of perfume in the air.<br><br>	BTW, all programmers want to tell you How It Works. In excruciating detail. As if you cared. Try to be patient. ";->"<br><br>
