Ever since the drop-off of the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier/admin/ltodbs.html">LTODBS</a>, there's been a lot of confusion about how sample bits and utilities should be distributed by and for members of the Frontier community.<p>

Our own <a href="http://samples.userland.com/">Samples Site</a> has fallen into disuse, and the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/fatpages/">Fat Pages</a> site is based on old technology. ScriptMeridian.Org has <a href="http://www.scriptmeridian.org/doodads/">DOODADS</a>. We've <a href="http://developers.userland.com/stories/searchEngineInterface">encouraged</a> people to add, via XML-RPC, their code pages to <a href="http://search.userland.com/">Search.UserLand.Com</a>.<p>

The problem has resisted solution. It's so easy to start something new, as evidenced by all the pointers above, but rather than starting someting new, I'd like to solve the problem. I'd like to start a discussion here that takes all the experience into account. Rather than dreaming up something new (we all love to write new apps), we share, I hope, a desire to get all the work organized so we can easily find what we're looking for it when we're looking for it.<p>

We have a lot of new tools. <a href="http://screenshots.userland.com/">ScreenShots.UserLand.Com</a> could be a starting point. Or we could pile onto an outside service, like <a href="http://www.scriptsearch.com/">ScriptSearch</a>.<p>

We have lots of technology, that's not a problem. Now how can we get it all to come together on one web page?
