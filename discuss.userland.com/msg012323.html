Don't we all? The problem with saying "I want the web to be the platform so that the OS can become clean" is that all you do is transfer the problem. Sure, the OS can become simple, but then the web browser (or the web itself) becomes incoherent and prone to failure. It's the nature of the beast that software is hard, and still way too imperfect. (I do recognize, of course, that some OSes are more imperfect than others. ";->")<p>
