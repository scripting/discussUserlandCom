Is there a reason behind the 32 char limit for a table name?
The problem is, when adding users from a 3rd party database to a members.users group, we are using each user's email address as their login (like they do on various webmail systems, such as netscapeonline.co.uk).  Alarmingly frequently, users and their ISP/Network administrators neglect Jakob Nielsen's rule about keeping low the memory load on a user, and choose rediculously long ( >32chr) email addresses such as :  <a href="mailto:micheal.myers@manchestercitycouncil.org.uk">micheal.myers@manchestercitycouncil.org.uk</a>  .
We cannot put this in to a GDB.  It wont let us.  Not normally.
However, we have found that when parsing a filemaker database of users, their email addresses and other details; the long email addresses actually do get put into the item name without a problem.
Again,however, we have the problem of new users to be added.  How do I do this if I cannot manually type in the address?
