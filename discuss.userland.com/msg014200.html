                     You'd get a situation where many different sites jealously guarded their content; the users of any given site could "use the
                     whole web" except that most of the web would be locked up behind proprietary walls.</i><p>

I can see that. However, the homepages that iTools users create ARE accessible over the web, aren&#180;t they? Same goes for iReviews generated and iCards sent.<p>

So the <b>information</b> and the access to it is open. Only the way to create them stays proprietary. As for iDisk, I don&#180;t think everybody should have access to my stuff there... ;-)<p>

Cheers,<p>
