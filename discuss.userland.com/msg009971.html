I have a lot of experience setting up and administering multiple flavors of UNIX (Solaris sparc/i86, IRIX, Linux, BSD), NT, etc., and gave up trying to configure IP Masquerading on a recent name-brand clone with a new linux installation. I had heard about IPNetRouter ($89 shareware, link is below), and I had a six year old (!!!) Mac lying around, so I gave it a try. Five minutes after downloading the software I had IP Masquerading up and running. I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry -- it was actually cathartic!!<p>
