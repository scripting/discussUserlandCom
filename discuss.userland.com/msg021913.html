As of 4:30 PM, the Winner Take All market on the Iowa Electronic Markets is showing the
      Bush contract trading between 80 and 90 cents, with Gore between 10 and 20 cents. Two
      hours ago, Bush was trading under 70 cents. People who are putting money at stake seem to
      think Bush is going to win. <p>
