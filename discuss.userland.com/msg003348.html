While I'm busy figuring out how to get URLs to dive into our membership database, could you take a look at "mainResponder.members.setProfilePart" and see if you can get the Java applet to upload into your membership storage area on our server? <p>

<b>Hints<ul></b><p>

<li>You must have a <a href="http://www.mailtothefuture.com/">MTTF</a> account for this to work.<p>

<li>Store the stuff in the "mailToTheFutureMembers" membership group.<p>

<li>Store your Java applet at "public.myJavaApp". (This will probably become a <struct> later, containing a mime-type so Frontier will know how to serve it.)
</ul><p>

Ask questions here if it's not clear how to get it going.</li></li></li>
