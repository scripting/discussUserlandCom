Life as a open source consultant isn't <i>entirely</i> a garden of roses. ;-)<p>

As with any sort of consulting, you have to be pretty chosy with your clients. Many organizations are too disfunctional to build custom software, and there's more than a few jerks out there.<p>

<b>My Mission Statement</b><p>

My company does Internet software consulting, with a strong emphasis on open source. Here's my official mission statement (no kidding):<p>

<ul>
<li>We find nice people with problems and money. We solve their problems.</li>
<li>We don't work with morons or assholes.</li>
</ul><p>

Along the way, I try to write lots of open source software. Once, I even <i>paid</i> somebody to write open source software, which feels great.<p>

<b>Consulting and Open Source</b><p>

Consultants get paid for their expertise. In most industries, consultants demonstrate their expertise through good references and word of mouth.<p>

But if you're a <i>software</i> consultant, you can do even better than this.<p>

If you write some excellent software and release it as open source, you get free advertising. And if your program is customizable, modular and useful to businesses, you've just gained a valuable area of expertise.<p>

<b>An Example</b><p>

Here's an example: Perl is useful. Perl is cool. And Perl is everywhere.<p>

If Larry Wall enjoyed solving problems for nice people, he could spend two or three months a year doing just that. The nice people would give him plenty of money, and then he could then spend the rest of his time working on Perl.<p>

<b>A Good Application</b><p>

Of course, if you want to make this work, you need to release a good application. Ideally, your application should be widely used, which means it should be easy to install, and easy to understand.<p>

(Some less-than-ethical folks delibrately write horrible software, and then charge for support. This might be profitable, but it's an insult to their profession.)<p>

If you want to attract new clients, your application should be an extensible toolkit for building new solutions. <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/">Ars Digita</a> understands this perfectly. They have a powerful, well-documented toolkit.<p>

...Or so goes my theory. Ask me in twelve months if you want to know how things are working out. ;-)<p>

Cheers,<br>
Eric
