The reason: Bananas are too perfect. <p>

<blockquote>
Bananas grow on trees, the trunks of which are easy for a human to scale but keep out other animals, leaving the fruit for human consumption.<p>

Bananas are sealed in a durable, yet easily accessable shell. The skin of the banana can be reused as well.<p>

Unlike zespris or avocado, you can tell the condition of a banana just by looking - green is unripe, yellow is ripe and brown means it's time to make muffins. (Even when rotten, the fruit is still useful).<p>

Bananas are very nutritious. I can't remember the stats but IIRC bananas are an excellent source of a number of vital vitamins and minerals.<p>

Bananas taste great. And the seeds are easily digested by human, unlike most other fruits.

Now, I'm not sure how nature managed all this by herself, but I do know I eat a banana a day and I love them.
