It sounded to me like the situation is:<ul>
<li>portal doesn't like their current deal structure ("pay per account per month")
<li>they probably want to change partners
<li>as a way of making the back-end market more fluid, they'd like an easy way to divorce their front end from the infrastructure back end, so they can change partners more easily in the future
</ul><p>

But this doesn't make sense to me, as it's pretty easy to just interface to SMTP/POP over sockets. (OK, it's not that easy, but there's a fair amount of existing code out there to help...), and I'd assume that's how their stuff works already....
