To be clear and to avoid misunderstandings I didn't say that MS as a whole doesn't take pride in its work, and certainly individual MS people add varying degrees of care and art to their work. No point repeating what I *have* said, it's all here to be read.<p>

For obvious reasons, features that were pulled from the product are of no use. Unless of course they're coming back sometime.
