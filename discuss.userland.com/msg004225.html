Point to the files from elements at the top level of the database.<p>

A filespec is legal and when mainResponder.respond encounters one, it serves it.<p>

Also, be sure to read the <a href="http://developers.userland.com/config/domains">page</a> on how the domains table works. I don't understand some of your questions, it may be possible that some of what you're looking for is already documented.
