The rules in Pike should be higher-level, they should provide commands for whatever driver is producing the output. It'll take a bit of time for this all to unfold and then come together, but in a few weeks I expect we'll be rolling out new Pike features at approx the same rate as we roll out new Manila features. And in fact, they will often roll out at the same time, since plug-ins in Manila will often require plug-ins in Pike.<p>
