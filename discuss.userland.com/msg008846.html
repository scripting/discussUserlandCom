I updated my mainresponder.root today.  I was surprised that the whole mainResponder.search.server table was replaced.<p>

The exportAddToLog only showed the following info...
<pre>
7/28/99; 11:56:04 AM	table
   item list &#123;"mainResponder.search.server", "http://developers.userland.com/"&#125;
</pre><p>

<b>It would be great if there were some detail as to what had changed.</b><p>

I started to dig by hand to see what had changed.  I found that some scripts hadn't changed.  Some had changed, but included none of the usual change information within the scripts.<p>

<b>I'd prefer it if the whole mainResponder.search.server table hadn't been replaced.  Unless, of course, all the tables scripts had been changed.<p>

Please continue to detail changes you make to scripts as you have prior to this point.</b><p>

The new search caching feature looks kewl.<p>

<b>I found that mainResponder.search.server.buildHtml isn't including an &quot;</tr&gt;&quot; at the end of each table row.</b><p>

I'm still digging.  I'll add more if need be.
<pre>
Thanks,<p>

Toodle-looooooooooooooo..........
