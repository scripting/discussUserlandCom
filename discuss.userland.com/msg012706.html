If that's not an option, then one .htaccess as close to where the original files were would probably be best.<p>

apache looks in every directory on the URL path (unless you tell it not to) for an .htaccess file, and parses it, etc.<p>

So -- it would boil down to frequency -- you certainly don't want a root-level .htaccess being parsed all the time if it's not necessary.<p>

(Unless something's changed recently, it ignores the mod dates and does no cacheing of the .htaccess information.)
