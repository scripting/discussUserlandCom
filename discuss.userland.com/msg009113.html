And they will do the win16 like thing for older programs, compatibility box. <p>

Latest and greatest does not just apply to LINUX. Think OFFICE. I upgraded my Mac Word from 1 to 5 to 6 and down to 5.1 before I got off the upgrade train. <p>

What is Windows Update for? or better yet, who?<p>

I don't assume that everyone wants the latest  and greatest. I did upgrade my linux from Suse 5.3 to Suse 6.1. I skipped 6.0, I never did  the latest and greatest updates. Linux is a cheap data crunching system. Not quite ready for my desktop use.
