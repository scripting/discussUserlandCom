I'm not sure what direction they're taking it.<p>

Looking through the WWDC session descriptions, I believe I spotted a mention of XML support in a library accessible to *both* YB and Carbon software.<p>

So it looks like there may be some kind of HTML/XML support
in OS X, whenever that ships. There should be more information
at WWDC.<p>

A library based on iCab would be nice anyway.
