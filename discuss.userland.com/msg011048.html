It's not like everyone that goes to your page will see this "new, unwelcome, unrelated content"; only those who choose to by using Third Voice.  If I'm using Third Voice I <i>want</i> to see other views about what I'm reading.  That's the whole point.  <p>

Analogy: I enter a room full of people with your website displayed on one wall.  We all discuss your website.  The discussion isn't your website; your website is your website; the discussion is a discussion.  <p>

If my ISP was doing it without asking me about it, that would be a different story.  If AOL or IE had it built in and I had no way of distiguishing between your site and the discussion, that also would be a different story.  But I'm just not catching what is so wrong with people choosing to use Third Voice to get a third opinion.<p>

Maybe if their name was 'The Way Things Really Are' or 'Additional News From This Company', I would be concerned. :)<p>

This all seems closley tied to a certain right that I consider to be unalienable.<p>

Perhaps there is something here I am not seeing?
