(And a few other apps.) Once it's tested, I'll switch the IP address of this machine so that requests for search.userland.com go to this machine.<p>

But for now it's at:<p>

<a href="http://207.76.185.151/search/">http://207.76.185.151/search/</a><p>

Please help test it! If you find any searches that still take a long time, please note what the search was for and let me know. It's time to nail all the performance issues.<p>

If you like specs: the old search engine is on a Pentium I, 166 Mhz, 96 MB RAM, IDE hard drive.<p>

The new search engine is on a dual-processor machine, two Pentium II processors running at 450 Mhz each. 256 MB RAM, 9 GB SCSI hard drive.<p>

The old search engine runs with Frontier as the webserver, so Frontier is doing both tcp and searching.<p>

The new search engine runs behind IIS 4.0 (NT Server), so the networking is handled by IIS rather than Frontier. (A nice combo, I think.) An ISAPI filter DLL routes all incoming requests to Frontier, making it easy to run Nirvana behind IIS.<p>

Furthermore: Frontier, even though it's running behind IIS, is now visible rather than running in IIS's invisible desktop. For more about that:<p>
