Assume in the next year we're going to spend collectively $20 billion for the war in Yugoslavia.<p>

What if we spent the money on the Kosovars instead? There are 2 million refugees. That's $10,000 per refugee. For a family of four, that's $40,000. Now, that wouldn't buy you a house in Palo Alto, but there are a lot of places in the world where you can rent a nice apartment for a few years for $40K, and send the kids to school, and train the parents to do good jobs. <p>

That's better than having hundreds of thousands of people on the road freezing to death, living in squalor, with no hope for their future.
