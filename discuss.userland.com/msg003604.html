When I flick the switch, the lights turn on. When I click on a link, I go there. This is making me think about what's going on behind the scenes for the first time in a long time...<p>

<i>- can you tell what's coming from where? We know these folks use extensive caching technology, I'm especially interested in "are they caching just popular web sites, or video/audio as well?"</i><p>

MediaOne works with the browser's proxy server settings. You don't have to use their caching scheme; I prefer not to. So I don't have any experience with what's cached. Things are plenty fast enough without it.<p>

<i>- has MP3 changed any of this?</i><p>

Don't know.<p>

<i>- have you ever experienced MPEG-1 video - full screen, full motion (30 fps) video through your system?</i><p>

30 fps? No. Or should I say, not yet <g>?<p>

<i>- what satnds out as being blisterly fast - versus just faster?</i><p>

FTP. For instance, if I go to get OS 8.6 off the Apple developer sites, it kicks butt. The *big* software downloads are no big deal. Getting 120-150k/sec. is ordinary.<p>

<i>- is there any 'custom' content your provider provides?<p>


- is there a 'broadband' portal that comes along with your service?</i><p>

Yes, at <a href="http://www.mediaone.net/losangeles/">http://www.mediaone.net/losangeles/</a>. Tonight's probably the first time I've ever even looked at it.
