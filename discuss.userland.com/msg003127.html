<ul>Another wishlist item, it may sound trivial, but it's not -- I'd like the screen-shot functions in Mac and Windows to put a GIF on the clipboard, not a PICT (Mac) or a BMP (Windows).

Check out <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/Products/SnapzPro.html">SnapzPro</a> for the Mac from Ambrosia Software. It'll capture your selection, menu, window, screen, whatever, as PICT, GIF, or JPEG, into a file or on your clipboard.<p>

I have no relationship to them except that I've happily paid the shareware fee and have used the product to make all the screenshots in both of my books. All the PC screenshots were done with either Virtual PC (before I bought a PC) or Timbuktu (afterwards).
