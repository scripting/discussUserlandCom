No go, he wanted to use Lotus Notes and follow the corporate path.<p>

I had an idea involving XML that a few other department heads became interested in. I even spoke with the lead XML guy up in San Jose about it and he was interested too. When it came time to move the idea forward, my boss wouldn't give me the time to pursue it.<p>

Well, the team's website failed under Lotus Notes, other situations arose and not long after I left IBM my boss was removed as head of the team. His removal was not directly related to me but he treated his other staff with the same attitude. A good leader, IMHO, tries to help his people, not just position himself for a VP job.<p>

It's good to hear that other IBM departments are allowed to consider and use other products beyond Lotus Notes and Lotus Suite. I think being open-minded in technology companies is a real good thing.<p>

I like IBM and think it's a great company. I wish UserLand good success with the relationship. I look forward to good news on the XML-RPC front.
