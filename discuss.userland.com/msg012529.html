Unfortunately if I go, I will only an attendee. Dan didn't invite me to speak after the first time, and this is a bit of a puzzle to me, because I thought I did a really good job! (I think I pissed off one of their marketing people with my impatient moderation style, but that's how I do it, and the audience never seems to mind, my sessions can be pretty lively. I do it by cutting off people who are droning.)<p>

OTOH, it might be relaxing to go to a conf just as an attendee. ";->"
