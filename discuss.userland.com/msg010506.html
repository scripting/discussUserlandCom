You said:<p>

"However, if you take all the links off my home page, and my comments, and present them as yours, I will object...I have even objected when one of the weblogs in My.UserLand.Com was linking to all the stories I linked to, with light edits of my comments."<p>

So could I take all the links, and all the comments, if I didn't edit anything? What about all the links, but no comments (not that that would do much good...your comments are usually excellent...but I'd still "know" where you were pointing folks.)<p>

If I understand your last paragraph correctly, you're saying I could, as long as I make no changes. Is that correct?<p>
