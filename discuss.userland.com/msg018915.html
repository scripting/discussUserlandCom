This is a big change, and IMHO a tacit admission that you can't make money developing a core technology like a scripting language.<p>

For background, up till now Tcl core development was controlled by Scriptics and before that the Sun team, and it was more difficult than necessary to get changes and enhancements into the Tcl distribution. This change means that it's likely to be easier to get stuff in, and that Tcl core development is likely to accellerate. Anyways thats my $0.02 opinion :)
