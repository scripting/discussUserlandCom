OK, that's a common story. Word processors have so many features, there's a big barrier to entry.<p>

But of course given enough years that barrier could be cracked. Personally, I think when the software industry is mature there will be several writer's software companies, as there are several artist's companies. A lot of writing goes on PCs. All writers basically use them.<p>

People focus on the features. That's not entirely what it's about now that we're doing stuff on the web. It's also about associations. Watch as Adobe and Macromedia roll out web services for their users. I watch this stuff with lots of interest.<p>

B2B.
