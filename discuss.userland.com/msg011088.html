I have error reporting turned on in my browser (IE/Mac) so I see these.  In one case, a newline was introduced in a keyword and in other cases some unsupported construct was used.<p>

In one case, I was able to eliminate the error by writing a simple plugin for the <a href="http://muffin.doit.org">Muffin</a> proxy.  (Muffin is an open source, programmable, 100% Java proxy.)  I simply modified the page to disable the script.<p>

(Technically, the same thing would be easy for Third Voice to do, since they are already transforming the page content.)
