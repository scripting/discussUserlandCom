We've got a web app that coughs up all its data. You've got a free tool with a scripting language and HTML rendering and lots of XML support that can process all that stuff.</i><p>

Let me step out of lurk mode and clear up my confusion. I assume that the "free tool" is Pike or Radio Userland (same thing?). Is the intention that this free tool will remain free after Beta, and wouldn't it be a good idea to be explicit about that? The heading at <a href="http://pikebeta.userland.com/">http://pikebeta.userland.com/</a> says "Free for everyone. The writer's web". At the bottom of the page it says "...since Pike is a free public beta..." It seems to me that if there's a free (or even cheap) client side site-editing tool which can export to XML that would alleviate a lot of concerns about "lock-in". It would be even more compelling if the scripting language was a standard one. (No criticism of Dave or Userland implied, I'm just trying to understand and weigh options)<p>

Thanks<p>
