I've been trying a new tack by using fewer words.  I'm effectively writing for a judge who will decide whether a person would have to be an idiot to misinterpret the intention.  My code contains the following line in the file headers.<p>

I realize this does not contain the normal obfuscating qualifications one is used to seeing in this context. But I'd love to see a judge ask someone which part of this did they not understand?
