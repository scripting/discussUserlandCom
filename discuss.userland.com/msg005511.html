Not with them screwing up my registration, but with them cancelling it.<p>

On 3/17/99 i registered "pissed.com", which was meant to be a website for ranting about various things. A friend and I had been working on it for about 3 weeks. Then, on 4/9/99, I got an email from NSI saying that they had cancelled it because they thought "pissed" was a bad word. Apparently they follow FCC regulations about bad words, which is silly since they aren't governed by an FCC regulations.<p>

So we've basically lost all the time and money that we spent on the website. And to make matters worse, "shit.com" has been registered since 2/21/99.<p>

I don't know if competition in the services area will fix any of this because if NSI refuses to allow a registration into their database, what can anyone do about it?<p>

We need to have some meaningful competition in this area. I can't imagine that it would be beyond anyones ability to create a distributed DNS system.
