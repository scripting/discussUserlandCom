It is obviously normal in a non-democratic country (and in a foreigner's consideration of government and people of a non democratic country) but it is also widely spread even among democratic cultures.<p>

When you say "It's time for us to grow up, take responsibility, get back on track" I read, from my perspective, "Can the US give an example of how people and government can be one and the same?".<p>

Here in Italy, nobody feels the politicians are what they should be to represent the people. Everybody always complains about the government and I've heard about the feelings that the vote is meaningless and that the choices are all bad since I can read a newspaper. I share them too, most of the time - but I feel better when I think positively that the citizens of a mature democracy should do something to change this and demonstrate that it can be better. Ok Dave, I hope you're right.
