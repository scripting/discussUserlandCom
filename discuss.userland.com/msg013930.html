There are no docs AKAIK about how to format a news page for best results.<p>

Is there a specific format which must be used on the news page, to ensure that valid XML is generated?<p>

Perhaps the scriptingnews2.xml script is "sample" code, and the expectation is that I will tweak it to suit. But I don't understand how this could work for an editthispage.com site.<p>

What impact do the settings for autoparagraphs, activeurls et al have on the process?<p>

Remember that this is vanila manila, the XML is generated by one Userland script, and consumed by another. No blame there, just an observation.<p>

Re the image tag, I've also tried it with no images at all, no tags at all and a few other variations. Same result, I'm sad to say.
