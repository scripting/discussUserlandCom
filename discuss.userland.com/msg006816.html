The structure looks like htmlInterfaces with a few 'traditional' Frontier pages (/faq , /restaurant) + a discuss.root stored <b>flat</b> list of stories.<p>

This structure can be quite ok for a smaller site. <p>

But for a big site, with a lot of departments with slightly different looks etc, I think the 'traditional' Frontier style is more natural.<p>

<b>Best of both worlds</b><p>

I suspect there is no real problem here. I experimented some with the discuss group scripts, and came to this:<p>

It's quite easy to store the messages (ie the tables that carry content and info about a page) in a traditional hierarchy. The scripts can easily be changed so that they use the odb address, instead of a number, when identifying messages. So the functionality of the discussion group scripts is kept.
