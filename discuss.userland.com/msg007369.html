What were they thinking?<p>

Why not encode the entire web page in the URL? It would be very convenient; the web server would just have to strip off the <a href="http://www.nature.com">http://www.nature.com</a> part and bounce back the rest...<p>

It could even be done on the client side! You click on the link and your browser displays the content of the URL instead of accessing the net; it would also reduce traffic.<p>

There would of course be a master URL (the mother of all URLs) encoding all possible paths through the entire WWW. We could burn it on a CD (no, many) and sell it as "the web".<p>
