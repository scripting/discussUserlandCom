The paper has several interesting points, of which scripting and RPC receive a great deal of attention.<p>

I don't necessarily agree with everything Todd says, and I don't expect anyone else too, either.  I did consider it worth reading, though, and I think a lot of folks in this discussion group might as well.<p>
