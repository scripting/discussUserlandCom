As we all know Banner ads are currently driving advertising on the web.  People claim that they ignore them.  But I think the brain still sees them even though people do not.  The proof is that with the correct wording and enticement you can achieve very high click through rates.<p>

All that aside, I am currently working on a system to talk with banner rotation systems.  I am interested in knowing if anyone is planning on using the Nirvana server to deploy websites on and will you be using the Ad Server?<p>
