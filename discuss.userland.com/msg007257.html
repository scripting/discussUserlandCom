Example, I'm looking at <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7190">http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7190</a>.  I click on the first response from Chris Hanson.  There isn't any easy way to look at the next response (directly down in the last screen) from Jacob Savin without going back to the previous screen.  The prev/next goes to the next post, but not in that topic.<p>
