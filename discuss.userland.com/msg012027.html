I'm not sure that matters.<p>

No one, not even Linus, is in control of what people do with Linux,because it is open sourced. If someone has a vision based on using Linux, and the resource, they can run with it. That's not true of a closed source technology.<p>

I do think that beating Microsoft is a terrible, destructive, distracting goal. But as long as coders stay focussed on buliding great things that stand on their own, Linux will be all right.
