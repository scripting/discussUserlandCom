BUT....<p>

I think one template per user is pretty limited.<p>

Shouldn't it be a hierarchy such that if the message has no template then use the template for the user (mailtothefuture.template) and if that doesn't exist use the application's template (allusers.template)?  <p>

We want to give users more types of messages within the broadband version of MTTF.  Text on stationery is only one type of template.  In a future version we even want to enable users to design their own templates or even the format of a single message.  <p>

We also want to have several "applications" using a common user profile and a common MTTF message pool.  Clearly Mail to the Future on the server side is an engine that could also be used by several "applications" on the same server.<p>

It would be even nicer if the template could be called by a name.  That way many templates can be stored in the user's profile and the message only needs the template name stored in it as opposed to the whole template.  (this should be enabled at the application level too - so an application can have several named templates, and it should be an inherited relationship so users can in effect redefine one of the application's templates for themselves)<p>

This may not be absolutely clear so if you need more info just ask.<p>
