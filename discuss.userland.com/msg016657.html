Right now I'm just mired in User and Security issues with Zope.<p>

But I can provide a <a href="http://zopefish.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$19">pointer</a> to the problem description.<p>

It turns out that the Pike integration was fairly easy.  The rest of what Manila does is Complex.  You've created a deep and wonderful system, Dave.  It didn't completely reveal itself to me until I started trying to do something similar.  It takes a bit of work to make a simple task remain simple.<p>

So please -- if any Frontier people want to join the project, come on in.  I'll send you the source (actually, you can get it right now at <a href="http://members.home.net/davidbro/ZopeFish-0.0.4.tgz">http://members.home.net/davidbro/ZopeFish-0.0.4.tgz</a> ), and we can trade cracks about my bad code, and then we can get to work.<p>
