If not, someone is going to be a middleman, whether it's Amazon, Cybercash, PayPal, whatever. Somebody with infrastructure has to handle the transactions.<p>I've been boycotting Amazon too, but look at the larger issue--if authors start releasing unencrypted text and taking voluntary contributions, Amazon's entire business model takes a hit. Especially when digital paper turns into reality. Somehow I don't see Amazon turning into a real force in the micropayments industry.<p>(Not that I hate Amazon, just their patent policy. Their website and service rock, and if they would just quit being jerks I'd spend a hundred bucks a month there.)
