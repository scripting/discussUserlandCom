A few days from now, maybe even hours from now, we will have moved on. You may remember at some point that there was a discussion on this topic, then you'll go to the search engine:<p>

<a href="http://search.userland.com/">http://search.userland.com/</a><p>

And look for it. You won't even see that it was tacked onto an earlier thread.<p>

As a manager of people who write for the web, I realized that I could stop caring where they put stuff, and just make sure that we can find it later. This stops a lot of documentation and exchange of ideas, the thought that you might be putting something in the right place (or not). I want my people to write and not worry aobut where it goes. Get the facts recorded in a place where they can be found by the people who need them.<p>
