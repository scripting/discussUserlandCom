The women are all out swinging on the trapeze, dancing on the high-wires, juggling 7 balls at a time, dancing and leaping and flying.<p>

There are men dancing and leaping and flying, too. <p>

But the men in the picture are not. (The man talking might be.) The women and other men are waiting for them to leave the stage and join them. Because they're having fun, and they don't want to leave anyone out.
