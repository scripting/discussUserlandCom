Here's basically what I wrote:<p>

You've hit the nail on the head in your final statements.  You've also intuited the history of the name:  I originally came to the idea when I was on an announcement-only mailing list and wanted to discuss a potentially hot topic; in fact the example at <a href="http://www.takeitoffline.com/example.html">http://www.takeitoffline.com/example.html</a> is the true story of my
inspiration for TIO.  You're right that in the more general context the name may be misleading.  I've reserved a couple of domain names, one of which I may ultimately use instead.<p>

Also, when you say "Steve's service, in effect, is archiving the topic for future reference by participants and non-participants alike" you anticipate one of the next features I want to add (originally suggested by Chris Locke, and reinforced by a statement in Jon Udell's book): letting the creator of the topic do a final edit, removing and editing messages as desired, before presenting the thread in a final format (sorted recent-last), suitable for saving locally and indexing by your local search engine.  This supports the need to archive a productive discussion for use in "knowledge-management" applications.<p>

Another item high on my to-do list is a more secure option with password protection (probably one password for the entire discussion).<p>
