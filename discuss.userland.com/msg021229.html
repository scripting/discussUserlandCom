Thanks for asking.<p>

It's pretty simple.<p>

When I post a message here I almost always edit it.<p>

When I write a message I sometimes make spelling errors, or use a harsh word when a softer one would be more effective.<p>

A "bot" that's monitoring changes here might catch an unedited message and broadcast it. <p>

That would change the way I write here. I like the way it's going, and I don't want to add a feature that could change that. <p>

Further, people have been posting my comments here on other mail lists. I find that offensive. The comments lack context. What I write on this DG is not for posting elsewhere. <p>

Having a bot sampling would inevitably mean some unedited words of mine will end up given far more importance than they're due. <p>

I have a scale of editing. DaveNets are the most heavily edited, and are the most on-the-record writing I do. (Actually DaveNets that are destined for print are the most on-the-record writing that I do.)<p>

Scripting News is the next level up, but only at 10PM. Up until then I edit and change and rewrite and delete, frequently. I don't think it's fair to cite Scripting News until 10PM, but most people don't know that, so I edit more carefully there.<p>

Here, I try not to edit too much. I will say things here that are not edited at all. But most of the time I do edit. <p>

So anyway, that's a long-winded answer. The simple answer is that I like the way this DG is going, and I don't want it to change.
