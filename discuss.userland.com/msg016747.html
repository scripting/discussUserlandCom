My girlfriend thought it was funny that I would recently be up all night trying to rebuild all my old Lego sets. Now I don't feel so bad! Thanks.<p>

Actually, I attribute my decision to go into computers (with a short detour in architecture) to my old Lego days. XML, SOAP, Frontier, Python, Zope, HTML, VB, ad infinitum - they're all just virtual Legos. The bricks by themselves aren't all that interesting. The fun is in what you can create by combining them.<p>
