PNG, QuickTime, RealMedia come to mind. <p>

There is something very attractive about Flash, though. Think XML-RPC with Flash; Frontier-data-enabling Flash. Alternate UIs for Manila content. For syndicated content. For visualizing numeric or semantic data. <p>

My brother uses Flash for fun graphics on his <a href="http://bomis.snap.com/rings/bulls_jordan/22" target="_mj">Michael Jordan fan site</a>; learned Flash scripting and design over a few weeks in his spare time. I love the idea of bringing that community into the weblog world.
