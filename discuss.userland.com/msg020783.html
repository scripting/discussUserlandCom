You do not upload the document, instead a java applet computes a signature for the doc, and this signature is stored in the FirstUse database. <p>

One great think about it is that this can be used for source code or any files you believe can be used to prove your early date of conception.<p>

For instance, if you regularly make a zip file of your source code for archival purposes, you can register it at FirstUse and no one can argue that you didn't actually have a program that does what that source code does running at a particular time. In PTO terms, this is called an "actual reduction to practice".<p>

Proof that you had something running on a particular date will make it difficult for someone with a later patent to SUCCEED in suing you, although of course they can still hassle you with a suit if they want. Of course, showing them your proof may well make them feel it isn't worth their while.<p>

I should also mention that the greatest beauty of FirstUse is the fact that it is so effortless. You can create unassailable proof very quickly and painlessly.<p>

Just a pointer, for those who may be interested.<p>

I am in no way associated with FirstUse or its personnel, I'm just a satisfied customer.
