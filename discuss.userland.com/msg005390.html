The "op" verbs seem to want to work on an outline address that was previously set in target.set().<p>

I can use target.set() to work on the new outline, but when I use target.set() to restore the outline to the one I'm scanning, all the positioning information has been lost (like what line I was currently editing), so that if I do something like op.setLineText("foo") the wrong line gets set.<p>

Is there any way to work programatically on several outlines at the same time?<p>

Thanks for any info.
