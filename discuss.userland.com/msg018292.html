And it's a great release, a real milestone, made sweeter by the accomplishments of the people I am totally proud to work with.<br><br>	A one of a kind corporate relationship blossomed, a project we started two years ago. It saw the light of day, and it's exciting, not just for the technology, also because of its humanity. My theory of the Internet, that the power of ideas matter more than the size of a company, is confirmed for me. Can courageous ideas come from a big company? Yes.<br><br>	A friend died, a puzzling thing, for sure, but new friendships started and old friendships renewed. <i>A baby was <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/30#aNewBaby">born</a> today!</i><br><br>	And the power of music came back into my life in a new big way. Thanks Napster! And thanks to all the cool musicians who left a trail through my past, that I can now navigate from my desktop. I know you didn't make enough money for all the teaching you do, the inspiration you provide, and I promise to do what I can to help right that.<br><br>	Yes, June 2000 was a great month. And I'm going to begin July, starting tomorrow, by taking some time off.<br><br>	<a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~hubt/indigo.girls/galileo">Indigo Girls</a>: "I call on the resting soul of Gal-i-le-o, king of night vision, king of insight."<br><br><b>A new baby!<a name="aNewBaby">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/30#aNewBaby" title="Permanent link to 'A new baby!' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Two dear friends, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/cassidayMomDad.gif">Amy Shelton and Dave Jacobs</a> had a baby today, a healthy boy, Cassidy. I love Dave and Amy, the new boy is sure to be creative and smart and very well loved. <i>Mazel tov!</i><br><br>	John Perry Barlow: <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/cassidy.html">Cassidy</a>.<br><br>	<i>Ah, child of countless trees.

The difference after last week's announcement is palpable. A week before the announcement we had a clear idea of how the Web can evolve to be a <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe">platform</a> for new cool stuff like Napster, but Microsoft's support, stated and public, and on the <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/2000/07/10/mic.html">cover</a> of Fortune, created openings that could not be created any other way.<br><br>	Here's why Microsoft's proposal is different from all the others. It really empowers developers, not just the captive ones, but everyone who has a scripting language that can do HTTP and XML. Especially developers who don't use Windows.<br><br>	Now you might think they're doing this just because of the horrendous cloud over their head, but who cares why? It's not my problem to worry about the goodness of their hearts. The door is open now, Microsoft can swarm all over this vision, will other developers? <br><br>	I was struck by Ellison's comments on Wednesday. He says they're doing the same thing Microsoft is. But where's their outreach to developers? What do they want us to do? Are they willing to let us lead them? <br><br><b>Morning pointers<a name="morningPointers">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/30#morningPointers" title="Permanent link to 'Morning pointers' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Microsoft: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/solutions/km/DDdemo.htm">Digital Dashboard Demo</a>.<br><br>	In an <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$843">internal memo</a>, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer names sixteen Distinguished Engineers. <br><br>	Reuters: <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20000629/en/online-napster_3.html">Napster legal brief due Monday</a>.<br><br>	Michael Rose found this <a href="http://www.w3.org/History/1994/WWW/Journals/CACM/screensnap2_24c.gif">screen shot</a> of Tim Berners-Lee's first Web browser/editor.<br><br>	<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$3576">New Manila Tweak</a>: "Sometimes you have a story that shouldn't have a byline, even though you want bylines for the rest of the stories." <i>Yes, that's true.</i> <br><br>	News.Com: <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-2176502.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif.ni">Dell to give away NetObjects Fusion</a>.
