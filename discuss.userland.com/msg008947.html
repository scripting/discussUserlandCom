"Internal Database Error:  Attempted to read a free block - Try to save a copy and relaunch with the new database."<p>

Here's what happened.  I'm using Frontier 6.0 on a Mac G3 350MHz Blue and White model with MacOS 8.6.  When I loaded an image into the image table (on a web site within a guest database), I renamed the image.  I then (by habit) closed the window which closed the database I was working with.  When I tried to reopen the xxxx.root, I get this error message.  Then the program freezes and I have to reboot the computer.  This has happened twice and each time the guest database is no long usable.  (After the first time I started saving a copy frequently).<p>

I don't know whether it is something I am doing wrong or perhaps an incompatibility issue (I recently went from MacOS 8.5.1 to 8.6).<p>

If you can help point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it.<p>

Thanks,<p>
