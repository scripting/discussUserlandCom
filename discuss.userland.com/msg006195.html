It *already* allows several people to view the same screen at the same time.  In fact, it lets those people all control the screen as well, though there is no mechanism for arbitrating between them -- it basically assumes that there is one user but you happened to go somewhere else without closing down your first session.<p>

Since you've got the source code, you could modify it to not allow others to control, but only to view, if you wanted.
