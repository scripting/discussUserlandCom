I agree that there is definately problems associated with allowing any element tags that an author wishes to use.  We put a great deal of thought into this area and have found a solution for it.<p>

What we did was provide an opportunity for the searcher to not specify a context (tag) for which to find their search subject within.  The default result for that query will then present that user with a list of tags (contexts) for which the keyword is found.<p>

This solution is probably best described as a temporary fix and will not last forever.  There are certain algorythms that MUST be built to accomodate more URL's.  Some more permanent solutions include a thesaurus, eliminating tags that occur in over XX% of URL's, lists of only the top 100 possible contexts etc.<p>
