Firstly, what I think you're suggesting is that the publisher knows where the content is viewed. This is part of a post of mine to <a href="mailto:syndication@onelist.com">syndication@onelist.com</a> today:<p>

<I>What excites me about RSS is the way in which publishers are publishing without knowing
what delivery mechanism will be used - the content creation and consumption processes are
completely decoupled</I><p>

Secondly, I was talking about the wider issues of syndication between e.g. XML-RPC servers, not limited to RSS / ScriptingNews etc.
