Dave, talking about UNIX and Linux, what is your plans with OS X Server? It seems easier to port a Mac app to this platform than to UNIX/Linux for sure. I gave up trying to use a Mac as a server because it just wasn't robust enough. I didn't go the UNIX/Linux way because they don't support all the serving needs I have (Appleshare, SMTP, Frontier, 4th Dimension), so now I have this NT box that does the job. It's hidden in a closet and nobody knows it is there :) ! Of course it does its job pretty well, wasn't too expensive hardware, but it just isn't sexy!<p>

I think choice is great. When Frontier for PC was announced I thought that was an excellent decision : all my friends on PCs would finally get a chance to use a great Mac only program (the same thing happened with ACI's 4th Dimension). The more platforms supported the more users ! And more users means a better community (and different viewpoints). I understand that the gap between Linux and Windows/MacOS is huge : the UI APIs are missing. I wonder if anyone in the Linux community is working on this (I am Linux blind... :)) ? A red or blue box would help Linux alot getting on the desktops.
