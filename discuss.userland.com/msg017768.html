You're invited.<br><br>	What will we talk about? Good question! One thing's for sure. We'll eat and drink. I have an early flight on Wednesday, but what the hell let's stay up late. No jetlag for this trip.<br><br>	<i>Prepare to feast!</i><br><br>	"cheesecake"<br><br><b>Before the trip</b><br><br>	Microsoft people generally have good manners, but not some of their supporters. In yesterday's top item, I said "I don't care if it's right or wrong that Microsoft is broken up." Of course I actually <i>do</i> care, my point was slightly subtle (not really, if you read the rest of the stuff). <br><br>	I agree with the Judge, until Microsoft comes clean and owns up to what it did that was wrong and illegal, it is totally right that they should be broken up.<br><br>	Microsoft has not behaved in a moral or legal manner with developers, competitors, and even the users, who had a right to a choice, which Microsoft's actions denied them. For them to invoke morals at this point is hypocritical and arrogant. It assumes massive stupidity outside of Microsoft. <br><br>	The day will come when an honorable and intelligent person cannot work at Microsoft. It may already be here. On that day Microsoft's arrogance will be totally misplaced. There are all kinds of intelligence. Even the highest IQ person has to live with the rest of us, according to some rules and morality.<br><br>	It's an interesting time to visit Microsoft. One thing is great about the company, I can say what I think on Scripting News, and I'm no less welcome. That's very unique in this business, where criticism is usually shunned. I don't do the egg shell walk very well.<br><br>	The part of me that appreciates this hopes that Microsoft sorts out all this stuff, and fixes the problem, so we can go forward with SOAP and whatever else we're going to do.<br><br>	Thanks for listening.<br><br>
