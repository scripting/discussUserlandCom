The same application many of you use to synchronize web content to your PalmPilots is now available for these users as well.  <p>

Those of you that are still using the 1.x desktop product should check out <a href="http://avantgo.com">http://avantgo.com</a> and download version 3 of the application.  Enhancements include html form support, channel management from the device, many more great channels from our content partners and online browsing abilities.<p>

Our software makes software development on WinCE as easy as writing web applications.  You can even read and post to this discussion forum using it.<p>

enjoy!
