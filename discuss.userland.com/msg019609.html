I think this is an area where Userland can really help:<p>

<OL>
<LI>You could keep a centralized db of artists/titles, each with a unique id.
<LI>When I add a song to RU, it would attempt to find the "correct" spelling, artist, etc. Perhaps a list would be sent back, allowing me to pick the correct one. A heuristic could be used to assemble the list.
<LI>After I pick, my song now has the correct title, artist, etc.
<LI>If your central db ever gets updated, i.e. a title/artist name is changed, my copy of RU will get updated in time.
<LI>If there is <B>no</B> match in step 2, there could be an option where I add an entry to the RU central database, since I am likely to know the correct artist, etc.
<LI>RU central would double-check my entry, in case the heuristic didn't produce the correct record for me to pick. We don't want duplicate records if we can help it.
</OL><p>

There are a number of obvious flaws in this scheme, but it might be reworked to address those as well.<p>

<I>Then artists like Prince are going to give us grief when they change their names, or try to go nameless.</I><p>

I don't think you should retroactively make the change for previous works. (like it would in a relational database) The song should be stamped with the name the artist used at the time of release.
