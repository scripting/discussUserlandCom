Why not make this an explicit option? Create a open source liscense that requires compensation as a factor of sale price and amount of code used or importance of code to the final product. Would this fill in the gap between the for sale developers and the traditional open source developers?<p>

Sorry if this has already been suggested. Too many posts not enough time to read them all.
