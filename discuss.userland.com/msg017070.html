The decision is <a href="http://flounder.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$177">explained</a> on The Flounder, which has become the venue for this discussion. Many thanks to the editor of that site, Simon Evans, for providing a neutral space for us to do this work. <br><br><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$639">A bulletin</a> I sent this evening to EditThisPage.Com members.<br><br><a href="http://lists.zope.org/pipermail/zope-mozilla/2000-May/000285.html">It's official</a>. The Zope guys have checked in XML-RPC support into Mozilla. <i>Yahoo!</i><br><br>Wow, birthday presents everywhere. <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$852">Edd Dumbill has just released</a> the final beta of XML-RPC for PHP. <i>Thanks Edd!</i><br><br><a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$853">I wrote a set</a> of Frontier scripts that call Edd's server.<br><br>There's a reasonable chance that an LDAP server for XML-RPC will come online this weekend. ";->"<br><br>We still need a scriptable <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$795">spell-checker</a> that interfaces through XML-RPC. And a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$318">search engine</a>. (UserLand already has one, but we want to outsource this function.)<br><br><i>Can Apache be far behind?</i><br><br><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/403805.asp?0m=-11I">Gary Krakow</a>: "My experience with Apple's iBook SE spoiled me. I got very used to surfing the Web on that laptop, via my DSL line, wirelessly, anywhere in my apartment. But, when I had to return Apple's AirPort equipment, I asked the SOHOware people to send me what I needed to get a Windows notebook to do the same thing."<br><br><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/jumps/0,4270,2561866,00.html">Peter Coffee</a>: "..even this defense is bypassed by Microsoft's proposed XML-based Simple Object Access Protocol, whose active-content messages are expressed in streams of what looks like simple text." <i>Bad bad bad. You may someday see a SOAP packet in an email enclosure, but until a mechanism is added to run the packet, it's no more dangerous than a soup recipe.</i><br><br><a href="http://array.editthispage.com/2000/05/05">Garret Vreeland's statement</a> about fair use of graphics he created. "All my free graphics are gone. Members of this weblog are still allowed to copy codebits they admire, but from this day forward I no longer allow the copying of any graphics without express written permission first." <br><br>It's unfortunate that Garret's generosity has been abused by <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/groholScreenShot.gif">defacing</a> his creations with hateful messages. The consensus of members of the ETP community who expressed an opinion is that we should continue to host the site, but I still have doubts about the wisdom of this. To be clear, the words are Grohol's, the images are Vreeland's. <br><br>
