I've extended 'outLineSite' as you suggested and have stored it in my sites #tools table as 'outLineSitePlus'. I have created a new directive called includePageInNavBar and stored it in my sites #prefs table. In pages that I do not want rendered by 'outLineSitePlus' I have added the includePageInNavBar "false" directive at the top of the WP Text.<p>

Unfortunately the pages are still rendered by 'outLineSitePlus'. I know the new code in 'outLineSitePlus' is being called as I experienced a macro error at first because i had not added the new directive to the #prefs table.<p>

Any ideas as to what is wrong here?<p>

Thanks<p>

Andrew
