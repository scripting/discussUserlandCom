I would like an editor to hook into the <textarea> part of a web page.<p>

Let's say that part of a <textarea> control would contain a column of program icons immediately to the right of the vertical scrollbar, or immediately to the left of the <textarea> box, above it or below it, I don't care. There would be a place in the Registry where a program could link itself into this group, a program would have to opt-in for this specific feature. On the Mac, a program would place an alias of itself in a folder that the browser checks whenever a form is being opened.<p>

Now in the browser, when I see a <textarea> box and click on one of the icons, the program launches and a copy of whatever I had already typed into the <textarea> would show up in the editing window. I do my thing, and every time I save, the result goes back into the <textarea>. Bring the browser to the front and click on the Submit button and the text goes to the server.<p>

The key new feature for the editor is that it has to be able to save thru a COM message on Windows, and an Apple Event on the Mac. The browser has to have a receiver to get the event. But with this feature, we hook the browser into the desktop editing environment at a level that many users will be able to grok. <p>

It also takes a burden off the app developer, they can leverage the browser, without having to support WebDAV or XML-RPC. Everyone has a web browser, right? It already knows how to send stuff to a web server. (That's what web browsers are for.)
