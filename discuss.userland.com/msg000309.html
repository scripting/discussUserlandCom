What was the issue? For once, let's not rely on our beliefs, let's get the facts.<p>

Here's what I understand. The issue is the Quicktime plug-in for Windows. It works in Netscape's browser, but not in MSIE. <p>

Did Apple test the plug-in in MSIE? If so, and it failed to work, did they raise the issue with Microsoft? Then did they raise it on the net, in mail lists or on Usenet?<p>

How come the first time we hear about this problem is in court? Has anyone else had trouble making a plug-in work in MSIE? Did Apple consider using ActiveX?<p>

What's amazing about this situation is that there was no communication by Apple to the cross-platform technical community before it went to the lawyers and judges and business press.<p>

I just want to know, for once, who's bullshitting here.<p>
