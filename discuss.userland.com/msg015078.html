In a nutshell, the bookmarklet grabs the title and URL of the current page and feeds it to my Frontier server, which takes the items, packages them in a form that allows addition of a description and selection of a category, then stores them in a table.<p>

The Javascript is:<p>

javascript:theURL='<a href="http://myserver/bookmarks/">http://myserver/bookmarks/</a>'+document.title+'$'+location.href;
void(window.open(theURL,'Backflip','toolbars=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbars=0,menubars=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=400'))<p>

As I said, this is proof-of-concept.  To be useful, it would require more intelligence on the back-end, something like a FileMaker database.<p>

At least that's what I was thinking before I saw Manila Express.  With the right hooks in a Manila site, it sure seems like this could do for the Mac almost everything ME does on the Windows side.  I updated my Manila root and MR root looking for something that might resemble such a hook, but didn't find anything.  Are there any plans to release the source of ME?
