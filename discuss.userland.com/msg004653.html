First, I love my.userland.com! It's great to have such a wide variety of news sources available. Great job!<p>

One suggestion: it would be nice for people supplying .rss files for my.userland to be able to see how many users have "subscribed" to their content. I know I'm curious about how many people are subscribing to the Fool's headlines. It also might be interesting for users to see which are the most popular sites.<p>

For example, on the "Choose Your News" page, it'd be nice to see how many people are currently subscribed to each site's headlines.<p>

Just a thought...<p>
