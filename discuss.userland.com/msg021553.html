<p>
I hope you'll rethink your requirements. By the time a user hits a button to go somewhere else, his mind is already on the somewhere else. For you to pop up a window relevant to what he just left is to intrude rather rudely on his consciousness.
<p>
If you insist on doing this anyway, fortune.com has a big pile of javascript that tries to do the same thing. It's not exact, but is a fair approximation.

For myself, I've patched the object code of my browser to completely ignore <i>onUnload</i> methods, just so that I don't have to put up with sites that do what you're trying to do.
