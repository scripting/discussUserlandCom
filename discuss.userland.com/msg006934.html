Someone published this list of basic functions in a content management system (I'm sorry I don't remember who). An editorial system may be slightly different, but I think most apply:<p>

<ol>
<li>- security (object ownership, access rights, sandboxes)
<li>- roles management (who can do what, to what, where and how)
<li>- approval chains (what must happen before a page goes live?)
<li>- dependencies (this page requires the following resources: &#123;.,.,.})
<li>- staging
<li>- version control
<li>- web interface for administration and content providers<p>


The points I would like to add myself is
<li><b>Flexibility</b> 
The ability to treat pages and catalogs as objects, so that it's easy to make a page/catalog render differently depending on location in site. (This is present in the traditional Frontier modell, but is not at all as prominent in the discussion group approach to cm.)<p>

<li><b>XML-support. </b>
The TCP/IP of information.<p>

<li><b>Freedom of editor. </b>
To let you work with your favorit editor. (A low tech version that goes a long way, is to have a smart import function for html, that strips the content out of the <body> tag, and directives out of <meta> tags.)<p>
