I don't want developers to start loading up my connection with flash just to make things look better. Or if they do, at least let me opt for a lower bandwidth experience.</i><p>

That's a key point which I want to address, and I'm sure Marc will have something to say too.<p>

The broadband MTTF app is just a demo. Do I really think it justifies a broadband connection? No, not in itself. But it's a step down a road that leads to something that totally justifies the broadband connection.<p>

Right now I'm editing the Scripting News home page thru a <a href="http://www.scripting.com/gifs/controlpanel4.gif">Control Panel Interface</a> that's rendered as straight Netscape 2.0-compatible HTML. It's good for what it does, but I want it to do more. I want it to behave more like a real software app. Broadband's user interface object classes can and will be that interface.<p>

Now, that's what I call a good application for broadband. If it lets you do something you couldn't do before, that's a good reason to make your computer slow! After all, you can always get a faster computer and a faster net connection. (If history and Dr. Moore are good predictors of the future.)<p>

See "What a Month!" for a look back to a preview of where we are now. (How's that for a loop???)<p>

PS: Another place where there's a broadband connection is from a web browser to an HTTP server running on the my own machine. I always leave that out of my lists, I have to stop doing that!
