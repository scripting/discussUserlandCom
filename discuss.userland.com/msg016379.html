It's cool, and then again, so is "my.userland.com" -- both have the power to dish up the fresh goods to us without having to sift thru everything else in our bookmarks to find them.<p>

Excepting the mega search engines and advertising, that's what the big portals are all about -- and it amazes me how all this technology is available for any of us to do the same, but in our own way.  Hell, that's what a weblog is I think.<p>

And then there's the *great* potential benefit in what you're saying as well, Andrew - sharing of content between sites.  That's something you'd have a hard time doing with any other customizable web portal.
