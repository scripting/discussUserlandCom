"How many" may be an over-simplification. "How strongly do they feel" may be important also. I for one, would strongly prefer to *not* turn "underline links" back on in my browser. Of course, if there is a single site that would motivate me to do this it would be Scripting News. "qbullet.sideSmiley"<p>

I must confess that I don'understand how anyone is advantaged by making unvisited links the same color as other text.
