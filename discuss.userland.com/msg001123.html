Having worked in the software industry since I was 15 I'd like to give some unsolicited advice... enjoy being 15! No matter how talented you are you'll have time to write code later. I fell into the trap of being ambitious at a young age and looking back I missed out on a lot of fun.<p>

Even at 20 I'm still overly ambitious... it's a blessing and a curse! <grin><p>
