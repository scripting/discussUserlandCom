Message-passing would consist of retrieving the objects via Freenet. This would work only as long as objects do not have to be unique, because Freenet makes lots of copies. Pretty big limitation, but still might be interesting for some things.</i><p>

It might make sense in some way to store an E SturdyRef on FreeNet, if the SturdyRef were to an object that performed some critical service for humanity that should never die. :-) Of course, the assumption here is that the person retrieving the SturdyRef would be in a position to do anything with it, i.e. that they had a working E runtime into which to import the SturdyRef and make use of it.<p>

The combination of capability security with protection against deletion and the like shows up in a narrower form in <a href="http://www.waterken.com">Waterken Software</a>'s Cistern product, which you can play with via their Beach Sex demo. Create and share your reproductive rights, or keep them to yourself, or make some available to the world... it's a great demo of the concepts and some excellent tools for implementing them using nothing but current web technology. Highly recommended while we wait for EROS and E. :-)</a>
