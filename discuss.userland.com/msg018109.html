The OED defines hash as: "2. transf. and fig.  Old matter 'served up' or presented in a fresh form; now often coloured by or associated with 3."
The next sub-definition for hash is: "3. a. A mixture of mangled and incongruous fragments; a medley; a spoiled mixture; a mess, jumble.  Often in phr. 'to make a hash of', to mangle and spoil in attempting to deal with."<p>

Anyone disagree with that? :)
