I was a regular reader of his site, and it's great to have Jim back for my daily visit, and I look forward to seeing how he uses his DG, and how I use his SE.<p><p><p>	<a href="http://villagenews.weblogger.com/">Erin's site</a> is a design showcase. Very beautiful look, to see the DG enhanced by the work of a designer with a real good eye. What a nice experience to see my own work presented this way. <p><p><p>	And finally -- a hearty congratulations to Brent Simmons for the <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/">Dan Gillmor site</a>. It's been a longish road with lots of twists and turns. Brent came thru like a champ, never complaining, and getting the job done on time. It's a beautiful site, one we will point to for a  long time to come.<p><p><p>	Onward!!<p><p><p><h4><a name="2">Dave</a></h4><p><p><p>	PS: To Frontier-users, both Jim and Erin are "Support Associates". These guys grok Frontier in all its glory. We're lucky to have them working with us.<p><p><p>	PPS: SE stands for Search Engine.<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
