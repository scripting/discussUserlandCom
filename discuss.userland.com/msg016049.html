SOAP is anything <i>but</i> a lock-in. I've never heard lock-in accused by anyone who's actually studied the spec. I sent an email to Levy. "What if Microsoft did something smart? Could you write that piece?"

Man jumps out of plane with no parachute. Plane cuts its engine and goes into a nosedive. Door stays open. Before both crash and die, the man goes back into the door and straps himself in. Plane powers up, regains altitude. <i>Now that's guts!</i><br><br>In the early heady days of Manila, back in early December 1999, I must have missed this <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/qube/stories/storyReader$98">review</a> by Luke Tymowski.<br><br>I used to wonder what would happen if we got <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/00/04/08/107204.shtml">Slashdotted</a>. No problems so far. Note that there's a link to this page, which is served by a Qube running at Exodus, but there's also a link to a <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/">Manila page</a>, served from Frontier running on NT on our Seattle LAN. Both servers are handling the load well.<br><br><a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16050">John VanDyk</a>: "Don't worry about being Slashdotted by <i>that</i> thread. I see it's degenerated into the normal uninformed flailings about Ritalin, Hitler, and God even more quickly than usual."<br><br><a href="http://pikebeta.userland.com/rules"><img src="../images/array/anotherpike.gif" width="102" height="32" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0"></a>I'm learning (again) that no matter what I say I offend <i>someone.</i> Sometimes that person is me. Yesterday I deleted a paragraph asking if a certain reporter was a "ringmaster of a circus of lies" which I thought was an apt description, but <a href="http://www.scripting.com/wavs/fargo5.wav">geez</a> if I ever want to work with him, maybe he won't want to work with me after I say something like that. I had a long phone talk with Doc Searls about this. I have to suck it in a bunch of times every day, it's the old JLG thing, the higher the monkey climbs the more people can see his derriere. I wish we could all take apparent criticism or unwanted fact-exposure more gracefully. It's not like you can take it with you.<br><br>Talking with Doc yesterday about "intellectual property". I asked him to prove to me that such a thing actually exists. Then I went further. I'm not sure I believe in "property". I ask my trees if they are my property and they laugh at me. "Hey sucker you're going to be dead a long time when we die." OK. The trees are very smart. Good teachers.<br><br>I wonder if people will be using "Frontier" after I die? I don't know. If Frontier came alive and I asked it if I owned it, would it laugh at me too? <br><br>Hey I took pictures of the trees but I'm lazy. I'll upload them later.<br><br>Here's a <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$265">picture</a> of some other things that I don't own.<br><br><a href="http://www.megnut.com/">Megnut</a> points to a <a href="http://www.fray.com/hope/childhood/post/index.005.shtml">page</a> on Fray where people tell about the stupidest thing they did as a kid. Many of the stories are things people did to their siblings that they feel guilty about. I have such a story. When I was a kid I played baseball. I joined a Little League team and they had a raffle. We were supposed to go door-to-door selling them so the team could get new uniforms, or something like that. The grand prize was a new car. I sold a ticket to my little brother, who often did exactly what I asked him to do. That was the only ticket I sold. But I never turned the stub in. So my poor cute sweet <i>trusting</i> little brother never had a chance to win. To this day I feel horrible pangs of guilt associated with this. I've apologized to him, and he told me not to worry about it, but I still feel terrible. Maybe now that I've told the story publicly the guilt will dissipate. (Aside from that, what would a little kid do with a new car?)<br><br>No outages yesterday according to the <a href="http://206.204.24.28/trackPacBell/trackPacBellWebsite/">Track-PacBell agent</a>. Could the outages be over? I hope I hope.<br><br>
