Microsoft's Windows Scripting services might just allow such a thing on the Windows platform.  Microsoft provides a way for anyone to hook their language into its scripting system, so besides Microsoft's offerings of VB Script and JScript, ActiveState also offers Perl and soon Python with the same capabilities.  IIRC, there are also vendors developing hooks like this for several other languages including COBOL of all things.<p>

Anyway, it would (I'm assuming, anyway) probably require a massive undertaking by Userland to make Frontier a full-fledged automation server to tie into these services, but I believe they've already provided a few COM hooks that allow you to run Usertalk scripts and some other things.  I don't know where to find the docs, though.<p>
