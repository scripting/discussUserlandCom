10/22/99 08:00:00 EST DETROIT, MICH:  Ford Motor
Company (F 53 1/2) filed suit early this morning
against General Motors Corporation (GM 66 1/8) in US
District Court in Detroit, alleging patent
infringment.  Ford is seeking an immediate and
permanent court-ordered halt to a similar feature now
being used by GMC. Both companies' features allow a
driver to signal a right or left-hand turn, without
having to stick an arm out a window.<p>

The suit also seeks an unspecified amount of damages.<p>

"We spent thousands of man-hours in research and
development to bring this obvious and intuitive
product to our consumers, vastly improving their
safety and comfort, and that is exactly what a patent
is expected to protect", said Yok Choke Mycompetitor,
spokesman for Ford.<p>

"They know where they can stick their turn-signal wand", was
GMC's response.<p>

Ford has named thier product "The Turn Signal".  GMC
calls theirs "The Blinker".<p>

The US Patent Office granted Ford patent number 101 on
The Turn Signal on September 28th 1999, culminating a
65 year effort by Ford.<p>

Ford's suit against GMC comes at a time when many
companies are trying to sue for missed opportunities
many years previous.
