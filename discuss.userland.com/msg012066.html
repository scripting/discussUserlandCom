This one fits in better with the way projects are handled in a business setting. I have set up a demo of the site at<p>

<a href="http://projectsites.ddbniac.com/">http://projectsites.ddbniac.com/</a><p>

The username is mmurry and the password is projman. Please be aware that this is running on an old Mac, so it's not as fast as could be. If you have any problems accessing the site, please sent an email to <a href="mailto:mmurry@ddbdigital.com">mmurry@ddbdigital.com</a> so I can investigate. The only thing I ask is that you don't submit any changes or add any users. My boss needs to demo this on Monday, and I need it setup the way it is. But feel free to click around all you want.<p>

I also setup a zip file of the source if anyone is interested in running their own version. You can download it at<p>

<a href="ftp://ftp.ddbniac.com/projectManager.zip">ftp://ftp.ddbniac.com/projectManager.zip</a><p>

Both Mac and PC users should be able to decompress this, but if you want me to email you an uncompressed version, email me at the address above.<p>

This app is going to be used for all of our work flow at my company. With this in mind, I set it up to mirror the way that we do business. I tried as much as possible to make it as generic as I could so that other people could use it in their customized environment. If there are any features that you would like to see in it, let me know. I can't make any promises, but if I have the time and it fits in with what we need here at work I'll be more than happy to add it.<p>

Also note that the interface was designed by our creative group and so I had to use a few HTML tags that can only be seen with 4.0 browsers. I should still work, but there maybe some cosmetic glitches. This app has not been through tested so it may have a few bugs. I believe the code is solid, but the GUI may have problems on some platforms/browser versions. I'm going to be working on fixing this over the next week, so if you encounter any problems I would appreciated it if you let me know about them.<p>

At this point the docs are not complete. I setup a few docs to help get you started in the readmes table. Please read these before you do anything. There's important information in them. There is also a few docs covering the some of the scripts in the Docs table. I'm going to working on these next week. I also need to work on user docs. If someone is inspired to work on this, your help would be welcomed.<p>

Enjoy and let me know if you need anything.
