Is not postCatcher included as a script in the download, and if so you don't really need to "create the cgi script."  My experience with screenshots was that I had to configure the 'picurl' and 'picfolder' values in the #prefs table and then it started working (almost).<p>

See if that gets you to where you can upload screenshots to the ODB.  At that point I will be curious to see if you can view them as that is where I am.  Frontier is creating a folder for the screenshots based upon email address but their is some kind of a security issue with the folder that does not allow me to view the screenshot.<p>

Let me know.<p>
