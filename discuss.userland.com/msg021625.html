It all depends on the cost of the search compared to the cost of
solving the problem. My impression of what Carmack means (or
at least my personal understanding of the objection to software
patents) is:<p>

A programmer wants to do some big, interesting new thing, call it
X. He plans to invest a great deal of time and energy into X so
he takes care to make sure it hasn't been done before. Since, at 
that point he has very little invested in X, the relative cost of
doing the search is small. While doing X, he also ends up doing A, 
B, C and D because they were problems that came up along the way. He doesn't invest the time in finding out if A, B, C or D have been
done before because taking that time would slow the development of
X to a crawl after a great deal of effort has been invested in it:
a huge cost. Software patents (especially on smaller inventions)
force him to make that investement at no benefit to him and no 
benefit so society, so the programmer is angry.<p>

I'll also add that finding out whether or not what you're doing has
been done before is much harder than it looks, even in the age of
the Internet. When working on my Master's thesis I spent 2-3 months reading as much as I could to find out what people had done related
to my thesis topic. At the time, I felt that while what I wanted to
do was a natural combination of existing technologies, no one had 
done it before. Imagine how I felt eight months later, the night
before I was giving a presentation on my thesis, when I discovered
that someone had built a startlingly similar system ten years ago!
