Maybe ATL provides a lightweight framework for doing so in an otherwise non-OLE oriented application.<p>

MFC is heavier-weight, but you might be able to finesse things by creating a generic MFC CWindow as a child of one of your application's windows, and then you could stick the CHtmlView under that.<p>

Otherwise, you would have to understand OLE in-place activation (although not full document embedding) and probably adapt code from _Inside OLE_ by Kraig Brockschmidt. Good luck !
