Of course there is.<p>

If you follow some simple rules when writing the source for your home page, a script can automatically generate a <scriptingNews> rendering of your home page.<p>

I could put the effort into writing such a script and release it publicly but it would require that you use Frontier. I would do it if there were volunteers to convert the script to Perl, Python, Tcl, AppleScript, etc., and publish the results.<p>

If we get enough support, we'll start a sub-site of My.UserLand.Com for community-published tools to support webmasters and of course we will publish our script thru that site as well as your script. This sub-site would follow the pattern of <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC.COM</a>.<p>

You would be doing a public service, helping to create more syndicated channels by meeting the webmasters half-way. If we can give them a CGI script that reads their source code and produces the XMLization, it will be easier to do it, and the theory is that there will be more syndicated channels as a result.<p>

All that's happening is simple text processing, so almost any scripting language will do. Let me know either here or by private email if you want to give it a shot.
