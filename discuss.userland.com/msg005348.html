I don't see many hosting services bringing in G3s. <p>

As of April 1999, <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">http://www.netcraft.com/survey/</a> reports that there are 2.8 million Apache servers running out there. (9 out of 10 of all 5 million detected sites are getting hosted.) If Frontier could co-exist with Apache/Linux, that's a sizable market. What percentage of all of the MacOS market (not just OS X) would Frontier need to penetrate to match that? And then where would it go?<p>

Once Frontier gets in the door at companies that won't trust NT in their DMZ, it could spread like roaches across the internal user desktops that are on NT Workstation or 95/98(ugh).<p>

Dave: Frontier/linux -- build it, they will come.
