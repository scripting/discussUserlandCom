These sites are not necessarily representative of the Internet overall.</i><p>

In particular, StatMarket tends to have a heavy bias towards home Windows users. Most of their trackers are on small, personal sites. StatMarket doesn't see traffic at business or technical sites.<p>

It would be much better to look at logs of the major search engines. They'd be more representative of the actual Internet population.<p>
