There are so many different ways to use Broadband - it's staggering.  But we're stuck in a catch-22 state right now - and will be for alogn time as long as the set top box folks still push their proprietary closed box mentality.<p>

Here's a few things to think about:<p>

1. First huge breakthrough - get rid of pages!  I don't mean the pages themselves - or the HTML legacy we'll have to be carrying around the rest of our lives, but the concept of everything having to fit into a scrolling page.  IE5 allows us to build true applications with memory and cache control, XSL object orientation, etc.<p>

2.  Video , video and more video. Did I say video?  TV commercials - full screen.  On-line live help operators - talk to a human who looks and sounds like a human, not some postage stamp.  Video screen savers. Video content, video commentary (isn't that called TV?)  Video weblogs (isn't that called David Letterman?)<p>

3.  Rocking the house, head thumping, twirl your pencil and go dance the fox trot - music.  And I don;t mean - through a tin can either!<p>

4.  New types of tools, collaboration, work at home, biz and educational info, the list goes on and on.<p>

All these things are possible with Broadband.
