I'd love to be using PerlScript or even JScript at work rather than VBScript. Unfortunately, VBScript had already been in use when I got there and it was deemed too late to change.<p>

The real downer about not using VBScript is that in other languages arrays aren't "COM" type arrays, so you can't just pass them to COM objects taking arrays as parameters. I suppose you could write a COM object that wraps up a COM array, but really now.<p>

In fact, if someone did and it was efficient, I'd buy them lunch.<p>

I do wish, though, that lots of people at work were using something (anything?) besides VBScript in their ASP. There are constantly questions about "How do I do X?".<p>

The answer is either
1) You can't.
2) Get such-and-such a COM object from 3rd party foo.
3) Wait until W2K / IIS 5 / ASP 4.<p>

Or use Perl and be done with it.<p>
