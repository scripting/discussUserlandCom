Where is O'Reilly on your list?<p>

Simple bidirectional chat is not P-to-P in any meaningful use of the concept, not to mention that most chat architectures rely heavily on central servers.<p>

Where Radio Userland is unique, at least at this time, and playing a leading role is in the integration of a complete application model into P-to-P. <p>

Hardly "old".<p>

And what was the answer to the question about O'Reilly and P-to-P leadership? Also, could you tell us what Microsoft has shipped with respect to P-to-P? I wasn't aware of anything. I'm guessing their .NET white paper doesn't count?<p>

Beta will do just fine.
