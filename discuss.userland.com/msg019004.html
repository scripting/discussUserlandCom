It takes payments through Amazon. King disses Napster in a news.com article. It doesn't matter. The key point here is proving that people will make voluntary payments to support artists they like. If, as Woz says, Amazon won't support payments except for a few major authors, fine, people can use <a href="http://www.fairtunes.com/">fairtunes</a> (for musicians only so far) or <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>. The specific form of this particular experiment is irrelevant--if the concept of voluntary support is proven, there will be all sorts of experiments in the best way to do it, and all sorts of artists signing up to participate.<p>(And incidentally, King does say on his website that he doesn't mind if you give copies of his file to friends.)
