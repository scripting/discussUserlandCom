It pulls the current page you're viewing out of the cache and opens it in the selected program. But there are only two options, Word97 <blecho! for html editing> and Notepad.  While this is somewhat useful, I really wanted to use a different editor.  If you look under Tools|Internet Options|Programs, you will find these two programs without any apparent way to add anything else.<p>

If you fire up regedit and go to:<p>

HKey_Classes_Root/.htm/OpenWithList/<p>

you will see two keys, one for notepad and one for word.  To add another program for editing:
<ol>
<li>Right click OpenWithList and add a New Key.  Give it the name you want to show up in your "Edit With" list.
<li>Right click the newly created key and add a new key named shell.
<li>Right click shell and add a new key named edit.
<li>Right click edit and add a new key named command.
<li>Open the Default String for command and edit it's value.  You will want to put in quotes the path to the executable you desire to edit with followed by %1.  That should do it.  I used "c:\program files\allaire\homesite.exe" %1  YMMV.
</ol> <p>

I've only done this with HomeSite, but I would guess you should be able to do it with just about any windows program. I had to fiddle around with the String Value to get it just right.  I also tried to add a Perl Script into the Edit With, but always got back an error stating that "c:/the/path/to/my/cached/file.htm" wasn't a valid NT application :(  Wouldn't that be a cool thing, though?</li></li></li></li></li>
