 While I agree mostly with your assessment, I find fault in the
 existing XML-RPC standard document in the following areas:
 <ol>
  <li>
   Is the <string> tag's contents considered PCDATA or just CDATA
   according to the XML-RPC DTD?
  </li>
  <li>
   Speaking of a DTD, where is it?  Or, better yet, how about writing
   up an XML Schema file describing XML-RPC?  That would help greatly
   in clearing up the ambiguities with respect to <string> and
   <double> tags.
  </li>
  <li>
   I'm grievously disappointed that the <double> tag doesn't
   support scientific notation.  I feel sorry for the poor souls
   who want to transfer large arrays of scientific data or other
   extremely large/small numbers using the existing decimal notation
   requirement.  Anyone know what 6023000000000000000000000
   approximately represents?  Let alone the unnecessary network
   bandwidth it consumes...
  </li>
 </ol>
</p>
<p>
 There are a couple of things I'd <i>like</i> to see included in a
 future version of XML-RPC as well, but which are not currently
 required.  Things like a standard representation for the UUID/GUID
 datatype, support for object references, etc.
