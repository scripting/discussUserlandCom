Here's my bet, er, dream. Jamie Z. of Mozilla.org and Alex H. formerly of Microsoft hold a press conference to declare the browser wars over and disavow themselves--along with five hundred or so geeks--from AOL and Microsoft.<p>

They announce the formation of a distributed, non-profit organization with a dual goal of a)developing Internet software in the public interest and b)providing a home for geeks to pursue truth and satisfy their insatiable desire to create.<p>

Yes! The backdrop for the press conference is three larger than life size checks for $150 Million each from AOL, Microsoft, and Sun.<p>

Best.
