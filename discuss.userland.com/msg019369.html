Probably true, if you are <em>required</em> to listen as you rip. However, many (most?) CD rippers will give you the <em>option</em> of listening as you rip. N2MP3, for example, has a checkbox in the progress window, so you can turn the sound on or off as you go. If you choose to listen, it rips at only 1x, instead of about 2-2.5x (on a 20x CD), but even then it's ripping from the digital stream.<p>
