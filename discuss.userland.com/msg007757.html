One which is seldom understood in this superficial age. That is the issue of MOTIVATION. WHY do people do something. Its very important. Is it out of greed and fear? Or is it out of a genuine wish to contribute something useful to others? That is what matters. And in some strange way it flows right through the process of creation to color the final result. I think this is something that can only be understood through one's personal experience over many years.
