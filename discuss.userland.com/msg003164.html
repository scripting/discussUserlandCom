Probably because WordNet only resembles a dictionary in some respects, but isn't really meant to be a dictionary. In other words, whether ``Aretha'' belongs in any dictionary is not really a relevant question when asked about WordNet.<p>

It can be used a dictionary, but the ``definitions''
in WordNet should probably not be relied upon in the same way one would rely upon a standard reference work like the OED. WordNet *is* useful for determining semantic connections between sets of synonyms, for tracing morphological connections between words, as well as a whole host of other neat things.<p>

WordNet supports a very rich set of lexical and linguistic queries, 
many of which are in fact useful for content creators. But its primary
purpose is to support computational linguistics, text analysis, etc.<p>

I do not rely on the glosses that WordNet contains as if they were entries in some standard dictionary, and certainly not for formal or rigorous writing tasks.<p>

If you're interested in learning more about WordNet, I can recommend the very good book, <i>WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database</i>, by Christiane Fellbaum. I read it over the Christmas holidays and found it very useful. There are two versions of this book, one of which contains a CD-ROM with WordNet bundled. <p>

Rather than buying the more expensive book with CD-ROM, I downloaded the entire WordNet database from the Princeton site and installed it on a Linux server on my local network. This is a rather more judicious and fair use of Princeton's computing resources, in my view, than querying their server directly. That's just my opinion of course.<p>

Note: I'm not associated with WordNet or the Cognitive Science department at Princeton; I've just been using it in <a href="http://ntlug.org/casbah/">The Casbah Project</a> to build an XML-based agent framework for content creators. WordNet in this usage is rather more like Cyc's Upper Ontology than a dictionary.<p>

Best,<p>
