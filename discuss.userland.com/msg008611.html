<I>"If you think about it from a common-sense perspective, how would Apple feel if someone typed in "apple" and got an ad for IBM?" said attorney Jeffrey Neuburger of Brown, Raysman, Millstein, Selder, & Steiner, who represents Playboy.</I><p>

It makes me wonder, if someone search for "Apple", shouldn't he/she get a list of results about the fruit "Apple"!<p>

Also, if the same logic applied, then the search engines could only sell the keyword "food" to "food.com", "parents" to "parents.com" ... at some point, the search engine companies will no longer have any sellable keywords, and go out of business.
