<a href="http://www.nara.gov/exhall/charters/constitution/">The US Constitution</a> doesn't protect the right to keep your links private, but it does say strongly that free speech is protected. <p>

From the <a href="http://www.nara.gov/exhall/charters/billrights/billrights.html">Bill of Rights</a>, the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."<p>

Seems pretty clear to me. Free speech, freedom of the press, right to assemble. That's the web. I think the forefathers understood the web better than today's journalists do!
