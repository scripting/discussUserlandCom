But I think, given the mindshare and passing-time factors, that a better decision would have been to release a standards-compliant Navigator-only browser for Win32, then working on (a) other platforms and (b) non-browser features (IM, email, etc.). Likewise, I think less work should have been put into 4.5/6/7, which has amounted to rearranging deskchairs on the Titanic.<p>

This would clearly not be the best answer for everyone, but I don't think the current situation is the best solution for <i>anyone</i>. (Ah the joys of second-guessing other people's prioritization criteria....)<p>

It's a tough call as to whether Netscape5/Mozilla or Win2000 get the vaporware of the year award. (Win is later, but it's lots bigger.)
