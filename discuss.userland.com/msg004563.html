Gah! reading articles like this reminds me how utterly beautiful the Newton OS UI is. It pains me to think that I sold my Newton 130 and bought a Nino. (Windows CE's UI is pale in comparision to the Newton)<p>

The Newton is (was) just too big, too slow for me - but one amazing piece of design. Still - I'd probably trade my Nino for a Newton 2000 in a heartbeat.<p>

sigh....
