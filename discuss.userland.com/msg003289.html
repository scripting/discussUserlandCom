Some of this is due to how we've chosen to evolve the software, probably most of it. We're going to do some toe-dips in the client/workstation direction, but won't take on established clients, rather we'll try to focus on new applications that build on the strengths we have that others don't have.<p>

I'm sorry this didn't work out for you. I hope you stay with us and stay creative. People who take chances on new technology areas are the types of people we like to encourage!
