It does, partially.  Reasons it doesn't: you can't rely on it being available as 1.1 is not widespread in proxies I think, and there will still be latency due to the request processing, if not due to connection setup/shutdown.<p>

Someone else suggested using one XML-RPC request to bundle others -- but was the intent to bundle within a single methodCall?
