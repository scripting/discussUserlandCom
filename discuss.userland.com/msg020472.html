Which is to say, it's okay for them to sell stuff in order to raise money; the problem is <i>everything else they do</i> which could be considered competition.<p>

So there are two issues here.<p>

One: the FSF might be considered to be competition for private enterprise, by providing software for free. This is apparently not allowed.<p>

Two: the FSF's sales of CD-ROMs and other gegaws may exceed the revenue limits specified for a 501(c)(3).
