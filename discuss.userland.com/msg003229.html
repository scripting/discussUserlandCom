named "Junk Mail", which is highlighted if anything ends up
in there.  Things don't just disappear.<p>

I've been using this filter since IE5b came out, and it has
never ever caught anything but porn, scams, and directly
criminal stuff (by some odd reason, 99% of that comes
from US sources. Go figure...)<p>

(by the way, maybe someone from Microsoft could tell me
if/where I can <i>buy</i> an Outlook Express <i>with</i>
the junk filter in the future.  Over here, it's actually a
constitutional right to be protected from spam...)<p>
