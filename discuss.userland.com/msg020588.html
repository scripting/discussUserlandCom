I disagree.<p>

Your analysis is very good, but I think your conclusion is too absolute.<p>

When I buy a product, be it a software application, music CD, or whatever, I am buying more than just "bits". Sure, I could download Diablo II off of a pirate board, but it would take too long for me. I'd rather plunk down my $50 than waste my time.<p>

Secondly, I know Diablo II is a first-rate product, & if I support it Blizzard will keep the titles coming. There is NO WAY a product like Diablo II would EVER be created by the open source crowd. At least in my lifetime. I need to support it if I want more. <p>

Thirdly, if I were to download it, I would be STEALING! Some people have no problem with it, but I will not.<p>

So I agree with how you have summarized the problem, but I don't agree that this is the "end of your world as you know it". Life is never that neat and simple.
