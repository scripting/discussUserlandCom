My project seems different from RU in that the idea is to create a real jukebox (as opposed to a RealJukebox!) for our office - any one of us can then pick songs thru a web interface and the whole office hears them.<p>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but RU seems more focused towards individual users playing songs and the playlists being shared. <p>

Could you have a 'server' version that offers the same functionality as my Zope product? Presumably, once the player is implemented, it would be trivial to add a web interface to let anyone control the playlist.
