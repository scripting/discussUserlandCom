<a href="http://nirvana.userland.com/myNetscapeChannels.root/myNetscapeChannels/default$http://news.userland.com/scriptingNewsToRss.xml">The RSS File Tester</a> provides a simple way to check the validity of Netscape-compatible RSS files. People have been reporting problems. I wanted to see if the problems are with the files or with Netscape's server, and also (obviously) to accumulate a list of RSS files. If there are enough of them we might be able to do something interesting here.<p>

Frontier Users: We got bit by the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/stories/commentBit.html">Comment Bit Bug</a>. It's a nasty little booger. In order to be able to update Frontier.root, manual installation of a fix may be necessary. The problem will be with us forever, when exporting an object from Frontier 6, if you intend it to be used by people with Frontier 5 or earlier, be sure none of your script lines are longer than 255 characters. We have provided a <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$4221">script</a> that verifies that for any script object. If you were already using the Frontier 6 app when you installed the last root update, or if you're a week or so behind, everything is fine, no changes are needed.<p>
