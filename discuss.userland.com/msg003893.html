I believe there's a fine line between the OS being determined by the application standards, and the OS standards determining the application. you already have some compelling reasons to go to Linux. Given a suitable product to replace FrameMaker, the pendulum will swing.<p>

Linux is popping up on more and more desks in development environments, because the tools are there, the developers are already familiar with what's running on the servers, they're tired of dealing with Windows, and developers in general prefer a learning environment rather than a restricting environment. Linux' complexity, and the subtle differences between gnome and kde, are features, not problems, to most developers.<p>

And what the developers use, is what they'll write end-user apps for.
