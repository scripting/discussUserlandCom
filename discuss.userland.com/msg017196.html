It worked for no one besides me and Brent.<p>

We were both using alphas of Pike, they had some stuff that got cleaned out before it went beta.<p>

We got to the bottom of the problem and have a fix.<p>

Back in a couple of minutes.<p>

<b>Step 1</b><p>

Download and install:<p>

(There was a change to the GET script, it now calls pike.init to make sure everything is properly set up. My copy of Pike already had run this. Yours quite possibly hadn't.)<p>

<b>Step 2</b><p>

Quit Pike if it's running.<p>

Open pikeStartupCommands.txt in Notepad or SimpleText.<p>

Add this line at the end of the file:<p>

<pre>user.webserver.responders.default.condition = false;</pre><p>

Relaunch Pike.<p>

Try the Firewalls with Piking Sauce experiment once again.<p>
