Now, I'm not sure of this, I'm no scientist. Nor have I studied Mars at all. But what's frozen in the polar regions? I know I've seen pictures of what looks like our polar ice caps. Is that water?<p>

If so, it's gotta be a massive amount of water.<p>

On a related note, I was watching some educational tv the other night, something about the moon. Apparently there is believed to be a significant amount of water there, too. In shady areas in deep craters. Kinda important for colonization.<p>

PS. I'm saddened about the recent apparent failure of the Mars mission. :(
