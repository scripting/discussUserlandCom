While I'm not challengeing your right to delete messages, it would be nice if the disucssion board was a little smarter about deleted messages.<p>

I have always reached these messages by using the next/prev links. So, if a message is deleted, could the next/prev links be altered, so they too skip over the deleted message?<p>

Another solution is to put next/prev links on the page that announces it has been removed. I don't care that it's been removed, I don't know what I'm missing, I just want to continue reading other messages. "Move along folks, there's nothing to see."<p>

As it is, I must backtrack my way to the main listing, and start all over again.<p>

John.
