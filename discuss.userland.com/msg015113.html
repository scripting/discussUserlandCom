Wha??<p>

go to <a href="http://workspot.com">http://workspot.com</a> - they give you a linux box via the net. I was running StarOffice, Netscape, and TheGimp all at once with no problems.  It's a little laggy on 56k but im sure on lan it's very smooth.<p>

Sorry if this is off-topic but it's just too cool to not share. I've never really worked with linux, but now I can learn how to use it without having to go through the nightmare of installing it!
