Both the commentator/heckler and the speaker are aiming for the same target -- your ear.</I><p>

<I>Everybody's</I> aiming at your ears and eyes!  But the commentator and the heckler are on different platforms: One's on the PA system, one's on the radio.  With TV, <I>both</I> are on the web page. <p>

<I>Your server and the files on it are your soap box. Once they reach my computer, I (and my tools) can do any lawful thing I want with them, even if the result does not resemble the page you wanted me to see.</I><p>

This is a tautology; I'm claiming this isn't a legal thing to do.<p>

<I>By re-displaying the document in a form that the Pentagon did not appreciate, were the annotation authors trampling on some moral right that the Pentagon had?</I><p>

As I believe you point out, American Government documents have different provisions then "normal" documents.  Under normal circumstances, they would not have been allowed to republish the data in toto; it would hurt the market value of the original work too much, annotations or no. It is difficult to trample on rights that don't exist.  Try doing that to a Clancy bestselling novel; the publisher will go right past "not appreciating" it and will be seeing you in court.<p>

(In other words, that is an exception, not a rule.)<p>

On a more theoretical note, do government entities even <I>have</I> rights?  I don't know, anybody know?
