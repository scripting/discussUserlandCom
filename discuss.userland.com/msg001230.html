That's one of the foundations of our legal system, and it's a really good thing it is. <p>

But when a trial is twarted by perjury and obstruction of justice, not only does that invalidate the original trial, but it also creates new crimes that have to be tried.<p>

It just keeps escalating. Trying to sweep it away won't work. We'll be fighting this one in the streets if we don't settle it in Congress.<p>
