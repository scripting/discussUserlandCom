Thanks for the other-hand. I imagine Greenspun is just average-level arrogant for an academic, I came out of grad school myself, a few years before he, with a very healthy dose of arrogant superiority, planning to show the idiots in the commercial world a thing or two about how to really make software. After I got the shit kicked out of me in the first deal I did, I came to have a healthy appreciation for how hard it is to make software that people actually want to use and that can be trusted with real data.
