Who decides who's on the core Linux team? Isn't it Linus? Or does it vary with the project? I don't see the difference. If we hire someone at UserLand to work on the Frontier kernel and he doesn't work out, that's not your call, it's mine. It's not a system based on broad popularity, you trust my judgement much as Linux users trust Linus' judgement.<p>

I've seen people can be uncomfortable with that, but there's no escaping it. Every step you take in a software project is an expression of the judgement, experience, intuition and creativity of a team, <b>with a leader.</b> If it were any other way, btw, I wouldn't be doing software. I find it satisfying to walk thru a maze of options and arrive at something that's useful. To me that's the art of software. It wouldn't interest me if that element weren't there.
