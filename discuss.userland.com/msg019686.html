Irritation as well as confusion: readers of "International English" have to put up with both the "Favorites" menu and the "Network Neighborhood" (sic) on the Windows desktop: spellings that are guaranteed to provoke the same effect in many Brits as a swarm of bees... at least "Bookmarks" doesn't have that divisive effect.<p>

Personally, I don't think that legal issues had much to do with it: from distant, distant memory, MS wanted to introduce as many elements as possible to the GUI of its newly-acquired browser to "distinguish" it from Netscape. Then again, the 1996 version of Spyglass Mosaic (obtained from the invaluable archive at <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org">http://browsers.evolt.org</a>) which became IE1.0 has a "Hotlist" pop-up box and a "Quick Links" menu, so things weren't consistent then either.
