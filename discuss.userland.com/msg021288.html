Would I respond by pointing out others who have claimed "perspective is everything"?  I think it is more profound than even that.  What you describe is lucidity in the sense that Camus uses the word.  This awareness is such a wonderful thing, but also not granted to all people and not even guaranteed to you or me continuously.  The ability to step outside the <i>sangsara</i> and see how silly most of our fussing is -- how can we give that to others, and how can we keep hold of it for ourselves?
