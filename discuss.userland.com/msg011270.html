I just came across some Zope stats on the Zope mailing list archive. A mid-level Linux box running Zope behind Apache can handle 10-15 K hps. The same box running Zope alone can handle 40-50 K hps.<p>

I'm reading a book on AOLServer and it handles 5 million static and scripted hpd on a low-end Unix box, and on a mid-level Unix server AOLServer handles 500,000 hpd with an avg cpu load of 1 to 3 per cent.<p>

The author's argument is that scalability is a fine buzz word for marketing types, but if you use your head you can build a single box which can handle a whack of hits without having to resort to server farms. It's difficult enough administering one machine, so why administer five machines if you don't have to?<p>

Slashdot, for example, handles 500,000 hpd with a server farm and gives decent performance. But I suspect if they top 1 million hpd they'll have to get more machines.<p>

I've been hitting the AOLServer-based site (www.photo.net/wtr) for a few weeks now, and I've yet to see it hiccup. Slashdot disappears from radar every once in a while (server crashing I would assume). phot.net uses an Oracle db to serve some of the content.<p>

I'm just curious.
