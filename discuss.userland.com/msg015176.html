The HTML didn't tell me much, but the style sheets made things pretty clear. Here's the big things they did wrong.<p>

<ol>
 <li>CNN mixed absolute and relative sizes on the same page. Although the people championing logical markup prefer relative sizes (and I agree with them), mixing absolute and relative markup makes it hard to determine why some text is unreasonably big/small, and other text is fine.</li>
 <li>CNN used a relative font size that was smaller than the user-defined 'normal' for a lot of elements. If there are large sections of text on a web site, they should be displayed in the users default font size, and with the default background and foreground colors.</li>
</ol>
