The <i>market</i> value of the GPLed code is zero.

No.  (I said something like this myself in something I posted last week, but I've changed my mind.)  If people are actually downloading a certain GPLed program, distributing it, and complying with the GPL, then the market value of that program is "compliance with the GPL".
<p>
There is nothing in US contract or copyright law stating that anything you license <i>must</i> be licensed for money.  I could license my source code to you in exchange for $100, in exchange for your complying with the GPL, in exchange for your signing a non-disclosure agreement, or in exchange for you painting your nose green, walking up to the receptionist at the front office of Microsoft, and shouting <i>"booga-booga-booga"</i>.
