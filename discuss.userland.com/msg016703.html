In connection with a totally different project, I recently re-acquainted myself with the old Shaker hymn "Simple Gifts", perhaps the loveliest single song in the American heritage; its words are appropriate to this discussion:<p>

<blockquote>‘Tis a gift to be simple, ‘tis a gift to be free,<br>
‘Tis a gift to come down where we ought to be.<br>
And when we find ourselves in the place just right,<br>
It will be in the valley of love and delight.<br>
<p>
When true simplicity is gained,<br>
To bow and to bend we will not be ashamed.<br>
To turn, to turn, will be our delight,<br>
‘Til by turning, turning, we come round right.<br>
</blockquote>
We are still turning; still digging; still trying to find that simplicity that accomodates the sweet spot in every pov.
