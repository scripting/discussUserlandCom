You got a roundtrip on this one! But isn't it a fact, that this view is very idealistic and that currently a UNIX port of some sort of Frontier executable for UNIX would help to push this?<p>

I think I got your point now, but it leaves me behind with the frustration, that I still can't make much use of my Frontier work as publishing or groupware tool (unless I have an NT/Mac on a leased line, which I don't).<p>

From the other thread parts, I understand, that there can be some kind of MySQL+whateverXML backing of Frontiers conceptual pieces (glossary aso), but this would be a very custom setup!<p>

What if I could simply save an ODB in a ODBC destination? Likewise I can save a complete Access DB into MySQL over the myODBC driver... <p>

Backing Frontier with a UNIX flavoured database would be a snap!
