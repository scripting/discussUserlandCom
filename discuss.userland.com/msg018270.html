<p>
Oh ye of little faith! That $30 before one downloads his first song is a major barrier to entry. Instead...
<p>
Make it free. Invite all comers. Also, make it trivially easy to tip an artist when one downloads a song. Possibly, get some custom code into MP3 player programs that make it trivially easy to tip an artist when one plays a song.
<p>
All tips are voluntary. Encourage people to try out music at no risk; make it easy for them to come back and pay only if they like it.
<p>
I bet you make tons more money that way. But it does require a larger leap of faith.
