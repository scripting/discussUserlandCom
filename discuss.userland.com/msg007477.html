Notepad simple doesn't cut it (see list bellow).  I thought I might ask the Scripting News community if they had any suggestions.  The best I've found so far is Homesite, but even it falls short in some important respects.  Here are a list of feature that I consider essential in any good text editor.  I'd appreciate any suggestions people might have. Thanks.<p>

<b>Features I except in a Good Text Editor</b><br></br>
(should be easy right? sure…)<p>

1. A clean, elegant interface<br></br>
<blockquote>If you close most of the optional windows, Homesite almost makes it</blockquote>
 
2. Syntax Coloring, for Perl, C, C++, Tcl/tk, Python, HTML, etc.<p>

3. A nice line count feature<p>

4. An integrated FTP client<br></br>
<blockquote> I don’t care if it’s in the OS or a feature of the program, but I need to be able to access remote files on a Unix system without opening another program.</blockquote><p>

5. A really good find and replace feature<br></br>
<blockquote>Must have regular expression support, search/replace across multiple files at once</blockquote><p>

6. Blink back closing parentheses when right bracket is typed<br>
<blockquote>
Critical for debugging programs<br></br>
Homesite lacks this feature<br></br>
</blockquote><p>

7. A split screen option, nice for viewing disparate code on one screen at the same time<p>

8. A good spell checker<p>

9. Soft line wrap, on off<p>

10. Convert spaces to taps and vice versa<br></br>
<blockquote>(work around- could do with find/replace)</blockquote><p>

11. Optional Emacs key bindings<p>

12. Scriptable<p>

13. The ability to have more than one physical window open at a time<br></br><blockquote> <i> I can’t believe I have to put this on the list, but homesite can't do it.  It uses file tabs, so can't have more than one open at once.</i></blockquote><p>

14. A nice compare function</br>
