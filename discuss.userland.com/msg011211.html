Way too common in on-line discussions, way less common among women.<p>

I also agree with the observation that single-gender organizations, of any kind, have their place. It will always be tricky, in that:
1) Members of the other gender (most often this will be men), will want reciprocity. Some of these will be well-intentioned, others less so...which brings me to point #2
2) There IS a sticky wicket, when one gender's "club" happens to be dominant. The Citadel case would be an example of this.<p>

Where there is goodwill and honesty, there is a way, though.<p>

PS I think LinuxChix is an inspired name.
