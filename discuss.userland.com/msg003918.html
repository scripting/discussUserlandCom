It's totally a Steve creation; he even picks which apps we get to run (by controlling the developer program). Apple is making sure that MacOS X Server is only for schools, publishing houses, and some Web sites, so it does me no good. The rationalization for this (and the price) is to prevent backlash; it's not for everybody and they don't want typical users (or even power users) to get burned.<p>

When Apple gives me a free copy, I'll be excited.
