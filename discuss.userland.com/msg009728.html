We were big Power Computing fans: great prices, great service, great personality, etc. <p>

But now, all of the Apple and Micron boxes are chugging right along, but the Power Computing boxes have long-since ceased working because of various hardware failures. Don't know what to make of that. Coincidence?<p>

As for PC clonemakers...
If you are not afraid to go with a smaller outfit, I have had some very positive experiences with SAG Electronics (www.sagelec.com).
