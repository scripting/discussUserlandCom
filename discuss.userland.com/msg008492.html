Andre has been hard at work, thanks for acknowledging this. Where we're at.. The entire path for serving dynamic pages is now kernelized. In 6.0 which we're running on all our servers right now, it's all in script, until we get to the website framework, which was kernelized in 5.1. <p>

The kernelized server functionality will come in 6.1 or 6.2. Until then, we're limping along and we know it. It hurts me more than anyone, and I complain persistently on our internal discussion group. There's evidence that I'm being heard! So it's probably going to get a lot better soon. But it will be painful, when so much code gets converted, there will be bugs.<p>

Further, when Dell finally gets the SuperHonker fixed, it will deploy as a server, not as my desktop machine. So we will add a dual CPU, 500 Mhz Pentium III with lots of RAM to our LAN here. We're going to move many of the non-UserLand.Com sites off Nirvana. Also we now have prefs synchronization working across servers now, so we have more options for using hardware to solve the bandwidth problems.
