But come to think of it, I guess I am actually more curious about something with a slightly different focus. Let me try to rephrase. <p>

I want to use a scheduled task to run a script in a language like Cold Fusion. I'd want this task to read over XML files at regular intervals (like Userland), and use the chunks of information for various purposes:<p>

Generating "channels"<p>

Feeding into a database<p>

But, if I'm not mistaken, in order to generate channels or feed information into a database, your program would have to be able to parse the XML file and realize <url>blah</url> is a distinct item. It would also have to be able to render the XML into HTML. It would also have to realize that everything in-between the <item></item> tags is a related item, etc.<p>

I don't know the technical terms of the software I am looking for--but in order to generate channels or feed into a database on my own, would I have to build it myself? Is there pre-made software that does this? If I had to build it myself, what level of difficulty does it involve? Thanks!
