Give other people space to have their opinions. <p>

I have a DaveNet piece in the pipe about this, it's about using your mind. If you have a good argument that's well thought-out, you diminish your effectiveness by resorting to insults. <p>

I want to build a place where thinkers and their minds are welcome. Please help me do that.<p>
