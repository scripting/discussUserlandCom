As the previous commentators pointed real truth has a deep, subtle texture.  A stark naked truth is as close to a stark naked lie as you can get.  We have the emergence of a new 'moral' McCarthyism in Washington, lead by the right wing of the Republican party.  It has struck not only their favorite Democratic target, Bill Clinton, but also a able Republican choice for speaker of the house, Bob Livingston.  Morality proves to be a dangerously uncontrollable weapon, which will prove to be far more lethal to the internet than that great compormiser, Bill Clinton.
