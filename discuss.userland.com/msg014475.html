BTW, thanks to Phil for reminding me that a Walleye is really a Pike.<p>

When I was at UW-Madison one of our mottoes was "Where's Walleye?"<p>

Actually it was Dave Hagland's motto. He used it to refer to Marc Spees. Who was always flying around the world somewhere.<p>

A Walleye is a friendly fish. Plentiful and cheap. Good eating, but not expensive like salmon.
