<a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$11">Here's the next revision</a> of our scriptingNews web syndication format, started in 1997. It's got one major advantage over RSS, the items can be paragraphs that link to one or more web pages, which more accurately reflects what's going on. We would have preferred to work with Netscape, but they have had so many departures and are so confused that they can't remember that they committed to working with us. <i>We love competition!</i><p>

You can see the advantage of scriptingNews format in this simple A-B comparison. Here's the "skinny" <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$8">RSS version</a> of this site, and here's the <a href="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$747">fat version</a>. <p>

We would be pleased to see these improvements in the next revision of RSS. That would be the happy ending for channel content developers.<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7444">Sidney Markowitz</a>: "If I were to be kind to Gosling I would guess that he made a reasonable statement about Unix being more virus-resistant than Windows and the journalist did the usual garbling that one sees in news articles. The less kind interpretation is that Gosling stretched the truth to take an opportunity to flame Windows in public."<p>
