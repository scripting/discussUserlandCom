What is needed is a complete model on the Net that won't require musicians already desperate to survive (and wanting to focus on their music) to have to become ersatz producers, distributors, programmers, web designers et al in order to make it from/on/with the Net.<p>

Napster itself is only one piece, though a huge one, in the puzzle.<p>

To name another big piece, how about micro-payments?<p>

The model doesn't need to be perfect, just reasonably practical with the upgrade path explained credibly. I don't know Frontier well enough yet to know whether the addition of the big piece I just mentioned and a few other related ones would enable such a model to be "displayed" for public scrutiny - and real-world experimentation by musicians.<p>

If I understand Dave, he believes it can. I sure hope so.<p>
