It's 'dynamic' rather than static, but one could always post a static page corresponding to the XML-RPC response at some URL and point people to it.  In fact, if one were to do that, then it would make sense to also include the server address and port in the description.  I'll just go back and add that in :-)<p>

This would also help avoid inconsistent docs: <a href="http://developers.userland.com/stories/searchEngineInterface">http://developers.userland.com/stories/searchEngineInterface</a> says that the procedure name is <i>nirvanaServer.search.index</i>, but the examples use <i>searchEngine.index</i>.<p>
