We're not exactly sure what that would mean yet, but we have some ideas. <p>

Right now, we're playing around with the Manila XML-RPC functions and successfully have Pyra/Blogger talking to Manila (as seen here: <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/pyra/discuss/msgReader$42">http://weblogs.userland.com/pyra/discuss/msgReader$42</a>). <p>

Would love to get your feedback on what Pyra working with Manila would mean and why that would be interesting. Probably, this thread isn't the most logical place for that, though.<p>
