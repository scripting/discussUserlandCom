My gosh, how do they all remember how to get to work in the morning?<p><p>

I don't live in California, probably never will, so it's not that big a deal to me, but I'm constantly amazed at how the Bay Area tends to think it <b>is</b> California, and everyone else is just intolerant, hateful, whatever.<p><p>

Prop 22 passed in all of California but 5 counties, all Bay Area counties.  It wasn't even close.  I have gay friends and family members whom I love dearly. But, like it or not, a majority of Americans (and apparently Californians) believe that a legal, on-paper marriage is between a man and a woman.<p><p>

This does <b>not,</b> however, make them stupid.</p></p></p>
