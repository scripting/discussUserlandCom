What is really weird is this section:<p>

"user-generated or "posted" content (i.e. Chat, Guestbook pages, hosted home pages)"<p>

Why wouldn't they want ads from posted content -- that has one of the highest click through rates on my site.<p>

Anyway, I don't know if it's standard, but it's very different from the contract I signed with BurstMedia (<a href="http://www.burstmedia.com/">http://www.burstmedia.com/</a>). There contract just has generic language saying basically that if Wired were to sue you over that page they aren't liable -- they're just selling ads.<p>

Their rules of membership can be found at <a href="http://www.burstmedia.com/release/join/faq.htm#4">http://www.burstmedia.com/release/join/faq.htm#4</a><p>

As for the NDA part, there are usually standard NDAs about the pricing of ads which is considered proprietary -- I can tell people how much the rate card is but I can't say how much advertiser X is actually paying for ads (which is rarely the rate card price), but that's it for confidentiality.<p>

The Flycast thing is weird. I guess I won't be running their ads either.
