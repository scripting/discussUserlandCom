Not getting into technicalities here (that would be no fun!) but to all intents-and-purposes it is HTTP. I quote from Nokia's 'Getting Started, Nokia WAP Toolkit version 1.1' manual available from <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com">http://www.forum.nokia.com</a><p>

The WAP is similar to a Web model and operates as follows:
<ol type="1">
<li>The user presses a phone key that has an URL request assigned to it.
<li>The user agent sends an URL request to a WAP gateway using the WAP protocol
<li>The WAP gateway generates a conventional HTTP request for the specified URL and sends it to the web server.
<li>The web server parses the HTTP request [cut unnecessary explanation of how]
<li>The web server returns the WML deck with the added HTTP header or the WML output from the CGI or other script application.
<li>The WAP gateway verifies the HTTP header and the WML content and encodes them to binary form. The gateway then creates a WAP response containing the WML and sends it to the user agent.
<li>The user agent receives the WAP response. It parses the WML response and displays the first card of the WML deck to the user.
</ol>

All the WAP protocol is is a way of efficiently getting the data from the telephone exchange through the air to the phone. Everything else is HTTP.<p>

<i>The confusion can be abated. Optimize existing standards of the net, XML and HTTP and do it transparently to web developers. I should be able to put an HTTP server on port 80 and have the same content as easily browsed by MSIE 5 and a wireless cell-device.</i><p>

I believe that WAP is doing just that. A couple of days ago, I used Nokia's WAP toolkit (to simulate the phone) and started serving WML pages. Repurposing my current data pulled from my database, it took me 10 minutes. Cool! I hadn't even looked at the WML spec before. Even cooler!
