I have relied on this feature. Is there something in it's place? <p>

Please explain how you rely on it. <p>

>>You also mention redoing user.scheduler as a builtin for 6.0 - Is all this part of the change. <p>

I don't know what this means. user.scheduler is a sub-table of the user table. It's not a builtin. builtins.scheduler has been a builtin since 5.0.
