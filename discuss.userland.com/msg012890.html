<I>The Apache XML Project includes something called Cocoon 2.0, which is an XML-based CMS. I wonder why they didn't go with Zope, which is gaining a lot of momentum and would get them XML-RPC compatibility along with Python?</I><p>

Historical accident, probably, more than anything else. The folks on the Cocoon project are all part of the Java Apache Project, so of course they went with Java. I don't think this is a bad thing: Java's popularity on the server continues to grow; XML's popularity continues to grow; the Java community got on XML early, recognizing it as the "portable data" to their "portable code;" Cocoon is (one of several) logical outcomes.<p>

FWIW, I'm not sure I would call Cocoon a "CMS." An XML-based publishing system, absolutely... but I haven't seen any explicit support for the creation/maintenance of "work product," if you will.<p>

As I've written before, I think <a href="http://www.caucho.com">Resin</a> has much stronger aspirations in this regard, and probably a better XML publishing story than Cocoon, too.
