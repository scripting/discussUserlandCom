In this manner, we'd know if we've rebutted the point or not.<p>

There are techniques to raise the signal to noise ratio even higher.  One of my favorites is a group brainstorming technique where you take each point and connect it to supporting, counter and neutral points, facts, and references.<p>

I've prototyped some supporting tools in this direction.  I'd be glad to collaborate on a nice little tool (BSD license would be fine ;-).
