"Does distributed computing have to be any harder than this? I don't think so." <i>Wow!</i><p>

DaveNet: <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/06/theBoysOfWoodside">The Boys of Woodside</a>. This is the first time I can remember that a DaveNet piece didn't get top billing on SN.<p>

Buck's: <a href="http://www.buckswoodside.com/pictures/viewer$130">Indian Princesses</a>. "Every year over 200 girls come with their fathers to Huddart Park for a weekend of Indian wildness. We are lucky to get a few every year at Buck's."<p>

<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$7088">Frontier 6 Users</a>: New version of the navBar macro that uses XML to specify the content of the navbar. It's faster than the non-XML version.<p>

"Unlike products such as Microsoft's Office 2000, which relies on proprietary server-side extensions to publish documents on the Web, all of the publishing capabilities in Amaya are based on HTTP 1.1." I don't think that statement is exactly true, Microsoft is using WebDAV, which is an IETF proposed standard, not proprietary.<p>

Internet Alchemy: <a href="http://alchemy.openjava.org/ocs/">Open Content Syndication Format</a>. It's a higher-level format, it gathers resources, whether they are in RSS or scriptingNews format, or some other syndication format. It also allows the sysop to provide a contact address (very important!) and specifies frequency of updating. It seems we could advance RSS to include this information, and also to include more of what scriptingNews format has that RSS doesn't. (scriptingNews predates RSS by more than a year.)<p>

IBM: <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/resources/magazine/1999/number_1/xml199.html">XML is the next big thing</a>. <i>We already knew that!</i><p>

News.Com: <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,37410,00.html?st.ne.fd.gif.k">Pay per-use apps</a>. Back in the old days we called these Service Bureaus. I think it's a no-brainer. Lots of software, including our own, requires technical expertise to set up. But not to use. There's the opportunity.<p>

NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/06/biztech/articles/07adco.html">Software Ad Blockers</a>. "An emerging category of Web software that blocks advertising is challenging the Web industry and rankling the nerves of some Internet executives." Maybe they could make the ads interesting so people wouldn't want to block them? Most banner ads and the pages they link to are <i>lame.</i>
