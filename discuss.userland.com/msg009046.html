That was not my job. The credit there goes to Peter Winer and Doug Baron. A lot of it to Doug. We used to call him "Dictator Doug" because of his steadfast insistence that we follow Apple's guidelines.<p>

When I started UserLand I hired Doug as soon as I could (I had a non-compete, and a covenenant not-to-hire). I suspect that because of that Frontier will stand the test of time.<p>

BTW, we'll re-release ThinkTank 128 and 512, these predate MORE -- I would be surprised if they run on today's machines (they didn't even run well on the Mac Plus!). But MORE 3.1 definitely does run on today's systems. That's going to be fun when we it up on outliners.com.
