Re handling links in items, I agree with your analysis, the format has its oddities, owing to its early invention. However, there's good news, you can just have a <text> part of an item with no <link>s and use the familiar <a "http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/href"> to do the job of the <link> in your example. In other words, there's no requirement that you break the links out separately. There's nothing on our server that depends on this, in fact as it's compiling the channel, it does the substitution, it never stores the links in the database, except as <a "http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/href">s in the text.
