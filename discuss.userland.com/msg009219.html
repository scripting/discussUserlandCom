In their battle against spam, they are using one of the classic methods (with "patent pending") to annoy the people you communicate with. Just watch. I bet that there will be a DOS attack against them where all the public msgto email addresses are collected and spammed using the return address of some poor unfortunate person.  <p>

BTW, for those of you keeping score at home, there are at least 5 classic anti-spam techniques:<p>

1) public/private mail addresses<br>
2) Munged addresses when in public<br>
3) Spam heuristics<br>
4) Whitelist known correspondents<br>
5) Blacklist known spammers  <br><p>
