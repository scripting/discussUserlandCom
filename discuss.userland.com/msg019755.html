Something like: imagine 100 rooms, numbered in sequence. There are people in either rooms 1-10, or 1-100, even odds either way. Guess which is actually the case--might as well flip a coin. Now, suppose you find out that your own room number is 7. Work out the probabilities (via Bayes' theorem they say), and the odds are 91% that there are only 10 people.<p>In the same way, there have been 12 billion people so far, so there's only a 9% chance that there will be a total of 120 billion people. Odd way of looking at things, doesn't seem right--on the other hand, out of 12 billion, there's a 50% chance of being alive right now, and much lower chance of being alive in any particular previous century--and here we are...<p>Haven't read any Stephen Baxter yet, he looks interesting.
