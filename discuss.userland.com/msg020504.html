<blockquote><i>I understand the general intent of namespaces, but general intent is not enough for me to code a deterministic symbol space that I know will have identical semantics with every other implementor's system.</i></blockquote><p>

The deterministic symbol space is the tuple (NamespaceURI, LocalName) which forms a universally unique element or attribute name.  Prefixes, namespace declarations, and declaration scope are all just syntactic (serialization) structures.<p>

"Semantics" is fuzzy as used here, NSs do not define "semantics", just identity, one can be assured that (NamespaceURI, LocalName) is the same name regardless of which system it resides in.<p>

One of the example I like to use goes like this:  Before namespaces, one could have a structure with attributes like this:<p>

<pre>
    doc.title
    doc.description
</pre><p>

With the addition of namespaces (which only happens when you require a decentralized distinguishing mechanism for mutual developers not to stomp on each other's feet), it begins looking something like this:<p>

<pre>
    dc = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"<p>

    doc.title
    doc.description
    doc.(dc, 'source')
</pre><p>

Here, the object <i>doc</i> has had a new set of attributes "mixed-in" to it (from the <a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dublin Core</a> in this example).  The new attributes are distinguished from the originals by fully qualifying the tuple used as accessors.<p>

It's not clear to me that there's any ambiguity there, can you shed more light on that?
