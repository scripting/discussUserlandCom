If he gets five percent of the vote, in 2004, the Green Party will get money from the US Government. <br><br>I'm just about finished with the first "OPML" web app, which I talked about briefly <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/08#lateAfternoonFeature">yesterday</a>. For every Weblogs.Com member with favorites, there is a static OPML <a href="http://static.userland.com/weblogMonitor/favorites/scriptingNews.opml">file</a> that links to the favorites file of each of the favorites that have favorites. Does it sound recursive? Of course, everything in OPML is recursive (that's one of the reasons outlines are interesting). I also have a <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$689">nodetype</a> for Radio UserLand that allows you to walk the network in a single window. When I have it all tied together I'll post a screen shot. It's easy to use, even though it probably sounds like it isn't. ";->"<br><br>More Doug Engelbart wisdom. Over and over he says we have to create a system for evolving our own system. That's why he calls his business the <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org/">Boostrap Institute</a>. Again, I have the same philosophy, though I didn't recognize it at first. I always believe the process is what I'm doing, not the software. Sometimes the process leaves bits of code and data out, so they can be added later, when it's clear how it should work. And sometimes a bit of code and data are just there to support experimentation, and later much more happens around the interfaces that are bootstrapped.<br><br>XML-Hack: <a href="http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=822">W3C publishes XML 1.0 second edition</a>.<br><br><a href="http://consentcache.editthispage.com/">ConsentCache</a> is running a weblog covering privacy issues.<br><br><a href="http://qube.weblogs.com/2000/10/09.html">According to Luke</a> today is Thanksgiving in Canada.

That's the Cub philosophy. The Gritty-but-Cheerful Losers of the National League. He says this is bad news for the Mets who have four ex-Cubs. Well, the Mets <i>could</i> lose of course. I don't think it's likely, but you never know with post-season play. <br><br><a href="http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/pickATeam">Survey</a>: Which team will win the World Series?<br><br><a href="http://mailpages.scripting.com/2000/10/09">Mail Starting 10/9/00</a>. Nick Sweeney asks "Is the spirit of a team different from its philosophy?" Yes, of course. The spirit is what's below the surface of the emotions and physical presence. The spirit is the observer of all that. A philosophy involves the intellect, it's the conscious form of the spirit. A team's philosophy explains why you came to the game. What is it that you wish to explore with your team and the other fans?<br><br>The Mets are an unusual team in that we had a philosophy from Day One. Casey Stengel made sure of that. The Mets philosophy is that we don't have to win to be true to our philosophy. If not this year, it'll happen soon enough. Also part of the Mets philosophy is years of drifting in and out of love. But there always seems to be a Mookie or Benny just around the corner, to capture our hearts and pull it out in extra innings, regardless of how many ex-Cubs are on the team.<br><br>The Mets are <i>not</i> just like every other team. An essential element of the Mets Effect is the losing. So many fans walk out when their team loses. These are not fans, and teams with such people calling themselves fans cannot pretend to have any philosophic depth.<br><br>
