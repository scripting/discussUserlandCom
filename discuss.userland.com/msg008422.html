"Sorry! There was an error: Can't evaluate the expression because the name "tools" hasn't been defined."<p>

If I put a filespec containing the path to the HTML file on disk containing my meta refresh, I get the same error. <p>

If I paste the meta refresh code as a string into an item called default, I get the same error. Same thing if the meta stuff is stored as an wptext or outline.<p>

This feels like it should be so simple...<p>
