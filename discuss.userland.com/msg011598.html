Well CSS and HTML options are also there for a reason, to give the designer some level of control. If you are particular enough, and savvy enough, you can override these with your browser preferences. Still, the designer needs to be able to present a vision of his work that more clearly communicates his/her ideas, and only he/she can decide how to do this.<p>

I like having options, and I use them. But if I don't have them, and/or I don't like what is being presente to me, I simply go away.<p>
