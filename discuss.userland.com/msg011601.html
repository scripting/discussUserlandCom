Meaning that say first I want to test the headers, then say call a simple function, then move on to advanced stuff. It would be great if there were a "testing" server which sort of held my hand so to speak and if there were archetypical messages to send and recieve so that I could test out my compatibility.  Meaning I send archetypical message 1, and the results I get back should match archetypical answer 1. Etc.<p>

Sorry if this is the wrong forum for this - perhaps I should ping the xml-rpc site.
