In fact when i discovered Zope just over 6 mo's ago, and was thinking "this is too good to be true!," i e-mailed RMS to inquire about the ZPL, and any hidden "gotchas" that might restrict my freedom with it.  He wrote me back with a positive endorsement , saying in effect, "This software is indeed Free.  The ZPL is not compatible with the GPL -- but since that doesn't seem to matter to you, that's fine."<p>

But please explain, cuz this OSS licensing stuff is still hazy to me:  are you saying that this "fork" in the Py license - which will surely be accompanied by a code-fork - is, unless hung-up by some deep technicality, a legally legitimate thing, at least on the surface of it?  Like the Emacs/ Xemacs fork?<p>

I guess if that Py license/code fork comes to pass, there'll be no need for any UserLand poll to see which way the wind blows, and briskly!   ;-)   |/|/
