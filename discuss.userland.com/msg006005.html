The objective, as I understand it, is to destroy the infrastructure that keeps President Milosevic in power.  An army is only as good as the infrastructure that supports it. At some point, it will come to the point that he will feel that the loss of his tools of power are not worth the cost.  It is unfortunate that most of the ethnic cleansing is being done by paramilitary forces that can't be immediately stopped by bombing, but my belief is that they were going perform their cleansing act regardless of  whether we bombed.<p>

<i>would the US have withdrawn from Vietnam when it did if the media hadn't been in the living rooms every night? </i><p>

Maybe not, on the other hand, Vietnam went on for more than a decade, and we lost more than 50,000 dead.  This conflict is less than 2 months old, and we have lost 2 dead.<p>

<i> B-2 mission is equivalent to 2500 WWII bomber missions seems ridiculous to me</i><p>

I am only repeating what I heard a top level military officer state on national TV.  He is probably correct.  What he is saying is that since the B-2 can take out 16 targets in one mission, it would take 2500 missions in WWII to take out the same targets due to the inaccuracy  of their bombs. The old way of carpet bombing certainly caused a lot more damage to the surrounding  territory, it just couldn't take out the bridge or factory it was supposed to.<p>

BTW: I kind of wish their were a separate discussion area for world affairs, social issues etc. Seems like when there is a hot political and social topic being discussed you really have to look hard for the technical discussion messages.  I sometimes hesitate to reply to other non-technical messages since I view the primary focus of this discussion area to be Frontier, the internet, etc. which can easily be overwelmed by discussion of social/political issues.<p>

<i>Do you just include the HTML tag for italics</i> Thats correct.
