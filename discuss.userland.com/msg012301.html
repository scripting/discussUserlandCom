So much for my theory you made the sex-with-boys remark in the heat of the moment. You should get your hindsight checked.<p>

Please rate the following behavior on a scale of 1 (perfectly reasonable) to 10 (astonishingly tasteless):<p>

a) Making <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11525">outrageous comments</a> about Third Voice.<p>

b) Posting the following <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$11532">response</a>: "check out Rogers' home page. See the little boy? Want to have sex with him?"<p>

Maybe your value system really is one in which these two are comparable.<p>

Personally, as the father of young children, I'm just glad you didn't spot any photos of my kids on <a href="http://www.prefect.com">my home page</a>. I can only speculate about the pedophilic come-ons you might have written for their photos in an effort to vilify a Web browser plug-in.
