After that anonymous posting you relayed here I did a web search for verification and found the <a href="http://www.compaqsucks.com">Compaq sucks</a> web site, with a few supposed first person accounts by Compaq tech support workers at Sykes.<p>

Of course the site is biased, and any company can have disgruntled customers setting up a sucks.com site. So I looked for dellsucks.com, gatewaysucks.com, micronsucks.com, and a few others, finding no web sites. Does that mean they have less dissatisfied customers? Maybe not: I then checked the domain names at your <a href="http://whois.userland.com/">Whois page</a> and found what may be a bunch of squatters... Have the vendors arranged for no-name third parties to buy up the names for them? gatewaysucks.com and micronsucks.com are owned by the same people.<p>

By the way, who is <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$networksolutionssucks.com">Brad Johnson</a> and why doesn't he have a web site to go with his domain? :-)
