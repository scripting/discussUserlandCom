One thing I'd like to see is when you choose to syndicate a site, your site is then automatically registered with the userland aggregator, and then will show up in my.userland's listings without having to make that extra step.<p>

My perception is that "weblog favorites" & "my.userland.com" are like twins separated at birth -- no way to deny their common ancestory, and there's a genuine longing to bring them together someway... but yet there remains a categorical gulf between them that imho should be eliminated.<p>

The two services together would be better.  >:]
