That doesn't mean that there won't be. I encourage you to post comments where ever you feel it's appropriate to do so. I offer <a href="http://soap.weblogs.com/">soap.weblogs.com</a> as one possible venue. It's kind of quiet over there. <p>

BTW, I told everyone I could that you should be in the loop. You have a depth of understanding of this stuff that's very valuable.
