If you can, please explain "I understand why those that do get angry."<p>

What did you do at Tickets.Com and TicketMaster?<p>

The more information we have the better. I don't think these issues are going to go away, and as the stories develop more strange behavior is going to come to light.<p>

Lots of cultures meeting here. Lots of economics at stake, it seems.<p>

Thanks again..
