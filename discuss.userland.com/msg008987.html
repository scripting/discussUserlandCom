We already have dynamic DNS. You would still need a client-to-client protocol, but at least you'd have a distributed directory (unlike the current situation where there are a few huge directory servers). The business model for DNS is simple: If you want to be in the DNS, you can either run a server or pay someone to do it.<p>

Another thought: We already have standard protocols for audio- and video-conferencing, which are much more complicated than IM. Yet there are probabably more people using IM today than conferencing.
