Like a calendar server, a timeline server, a "windowing" server, etc.<p>

In another way, what if you built applications that automatically cut up a problem into little pieces, sent those pieces to lots of different machines, and then re-assembled the answer?  Sort of like having an "account" on thousands of machines and leveraging that into one big super computer..<p>

This is sort of what SETI @home project is going to do.  Thousands of people will download a "screen saver" that processes tons of data that SETI couldnt on it's own.  While tons of computers are in "screen saver" mode, they crunch numbers and send the data back to SETI.<p>

That's a neato idea.
