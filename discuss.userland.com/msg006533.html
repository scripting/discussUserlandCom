UI design is a skill. I'm constantly amazed that while the web opens doors for designers, they constantly resort to making things "pretty" instead of functional. <p>

IMHO, I think design schools need to start teaching UI as a basic requirement for graduation. Industrial Design has had this type of eduction for years, its called human factors. Its time graphic design caught up.
