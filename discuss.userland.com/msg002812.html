Hello Everyone,<p>

I'm just starting to learn Dreamweaver, to see how it can be integrated into Frontier.<p>

I need to know how Dreamweaver works as compared to how Frontier works, for template-based websites and team development.  Unfortunately I don't have a team to work with or a sample site to work on (nor time to get either).<p>

I just watched the Dreamweaver Templates movie that comes with DW2, and it looked very good.  I didn't know that DW could update a whole site to use a new template.  That's pretty good.<p>

What I'm looking for, is someone who uses or knows DW2 to answer the following questions:<p>

 - What does Frontier do that Dreamweaver doesn't?  (State the obvious too, please!!!)<p>

 - What does Dreamweaver do that Frontier doesn't?  (Remember, I'm a DW2 newbie)<p>

 - How do/can they complement each other?<p>

 - If a team is using DW2 already, what would they gain by adding a Frontier CMS?<p>

 - If a team is going to use DW2, but hasn't started yet, what things can/should that team do differently than is "normal DW2 practice" to take advantage of having a CMS and make the integration less problematic?<p>

 - What DW suites are available for Frontier, and what do they currently do?  Any Frontier extensions for DW?<p>

Any and all advice and knowledge transfer is VERY GREATLY appreciated!!<p>

Thanks in advance!<p>
