I'm amazed that people are taking this so personally, though. Designing for accessibility is (to me) like remembering that cyclists and pedestrians use the roads too when I'm driving a car. I think everyone should design for accessibility, but hey, who the hell am I. Stating an opinion is not the same as imposing it.<p>

<I>Personally, I don't like it when other people impose their values on me, and I imagine other people feel the same way.</I><p>

Forgive me for be-bopping when I should be doing the twist, but isn't designing an inaccessible site imposing your values on other people?<p>

I generally try to avoid terms like "civil rights" and "litigation" when discussing accessibility. If I can't get people to consider it because "it's a nice thing to do", then what hope is there?
