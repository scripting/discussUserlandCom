To me reading the frontier lists, it seems that the mac still acounts for a large proportion of your users.  To a certain extent, I like a number of others, followed userland to windows and look forward to tagging along onto Linux.  However, can a company make money selling software at userland prices to the linux community that is used to getting software essentially for free?  Can you afford to sacrifice your Mac base (I bet they won't stay unless you at least "carbonize" the app)?
