They think that XML is too heavy a burden, they think it would be faster if it was a binary protocol, they had a few other objections.<p>

This was communicated to me by one of the gods of IETF, they noticed XML-RPC and they don't think it's a good idea.<p>

I of course have a different point of view. I think XML-RPC is the kind of stuff a more technical HTML coder can graduate to, and the fact that it's not binary makes it discoverable, and easy to figure out how to mimic. That opens the doors much more widely, and the wait is shorter to get it adopted by development tools.<p>

We only need a few more environments to cover everything. Tcl is on its way, I heard today, there's a group of people working on it. There's a JavaScript version lurking in the vaults of Broadband Mechanics, and I'm hoping either they will release it, or someone else will get it together and release the source and document it.<p>

So, from a practical standpoint, IETF or W3C support would be nice, couldn't hurt, but it's not necessary to get XML-RPC widely deployed.<p>
