Wow! This is going to be fun." Here's his reply, received this morning.</i><p>

"Dave, this is great news! I just got back from vacation in France, so I had no idea this all took off 
so fast. (Here I was visiting old castles and at the same time people from 
all over the world were trying out old software!)<p>

"Congratulations for making this all really happen. You're a real catalyst! 
When I get my head above water from 10 days of email (including one from 
Dan Gillmor...) and corporate stuff I'll write some more -- I have some 
other ideas for letting people learn from this old stuff -- also, I need to 
send another thank you to the people at Lotus who had the courage to be the 
first."
