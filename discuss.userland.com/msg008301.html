1) title is optional.
In this case, sites like My Netscape that display title and link only must either: ignore the item, display the raw link, display the first few lines of the item description (is it required?), or display some sort of "title unavailable" text.<p>

2) title is required.
This takes care of My Netscape like sites, and places the burden on publishers whose format doesn't lend itself well to providing titles.<p>

However, it seems to me that the publisher, who is closer to the original content, is in a better position to decide the correct title than the receiver, which is a case for making the title be required. <p>

Finally, by way of explanation, the original idea behind RSS was that each link logically corresponded to a page, and each page could be expected to have an associated title.  I realize that many publishers have been sending links to weblog-like pages, so this is not always the case.<p>
