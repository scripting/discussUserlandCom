That's good to hear!<p>

FWIW, I'd advise sticking with the NGWS name. It's already fairly well-planted in our minds, and it doesn't have any unfortunate other meanings (as Win CE did), and as acronyms go, it's not too bad. There's nothing more difficult to do than to add a translation table in the market's mind, and in the end it doesn't matter much. For example "NT" which had a long run, used to stand for "New Technology" back when Microsoft was wanting to get out of bed with IBM on OS/2.
