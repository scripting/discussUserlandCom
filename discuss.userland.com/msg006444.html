<ul>
<li> 'frontmost window' under X is not very meaningful - more often than not one really wants the active window which may not be frontmost.
<li> For interacting with X-based apps, there is ICCCM (I believe this is how Tk implements 'send') which is how apps are supposed to communicate with the window manager, amongst other things.<p>

Now, access to ICCCM from a scripting language is something else entirely, and I'm not even a novice in using it.
