The most typical configuration of a firewall I have seen is one that Lets all traffic out, but only lets incomming connections to specific machine on specific ports.  i.e. you limit the points of intrusion into your network.  <p>

Don't go disparaging firewalls just because a few clueless managers don't understand them.  <p>

P.S. I was a little put off by the description of firewalls on the Pike page.  It seems to me that it is telling users that firewalls are there to monitor their actions.  It is misleading to people and insulting to administrators.
