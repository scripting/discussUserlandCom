I think Dave's (et al.) criticism of Linux mags publishing model is fine in the spirit of good-natured teasing. But if serious, it could be just as obnoxious as a Linux fanatic insisting (everyone else's) software being free.<p>

In the Linux world, software is free, and you make money on support. Maybe they think the magazine's are "support". Dave gives away some support (and commentary, and thought-provocation--DaveNet is free) and sells software. Which one is wrong? (Hint: Take out T-C-P.)
