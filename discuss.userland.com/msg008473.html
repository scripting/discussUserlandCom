They're already producing a RSS version of MacWEEK news. The MacWorld site is generated with Frontier (as is the MacWEEK site).<p>

What's needed: A macro that reads a channel and renders it as HTML text. The macro is called from the template for the MacWorld home page. It caches the resulting text so that the channel is not read more than once an hour.<p>

<b>The script</b><p>

Here's a source <a href="http://news.userland.com/discuss/enclosures/view$8473">listing</a> for the macro.<p>

To include it in a page call it as follows:<p>

&#123;rssChannel ("http://macweek.zdnet.com/macweek.xml")&#125;<p>

<b>The rendering</b><p>

It's very simple. You can tweak it to make it how you like it. (That's why it's sample code.)<p>

You can use this to render any valid RSS file that's accessible over the Internet.</img>
