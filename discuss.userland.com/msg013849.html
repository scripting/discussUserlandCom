actually, I am considering launching a commercial Manila hosting service and thought 60 days free was a great way to showcase Manila and provide a low-cost-to-entry option for those who don't want to purchase the full boat (cheap as it is)- I will implement the same program here (if I can get management to break with the cash!)<p>

that the trial on Userland servers is now of indeterminate length is no concern to me (other than being encouraged to work with my own editthispage.com site!) - we will need many, many folks to "get their feet wet" to drive significant market interest in Manila and Frontier<p>

I am also considering offering a low-cost setup option for folks moving existing sites (either from editthispage.com or our own 60 day free service)<p>

it seems to me Dave/Userland's method beats the hell out of shipping CD's with "250 hours free"<p>

cheers
