I tried following the docs this morning (London time) - with no luck. I'm not seeing any pages queued for indexing, *except* when I check out with WebEdit. does this work for you?<p>

hmm. the 'initIndex' script chokes on some code in my pages. trying to work out why - -<p>

One thing that does work (to index pages when they are hit using MR) is to set up an 'index this page' script in the finalFilter, like so:<p>

<pre>
&#171;bundle
	&#171;local
		&#171;title = adrPageTable^.title
		&#171;url = adrPageTable^.url
		&#171;text = searchEngine.stripMarkup (adrPageTable^.renderedText)
		&#171;siteName = "TIME Magazine"
		&#171;siteURL = "http://loop.timeinc.com/time/"
	&#171;user.html.addToSearchEngine (title, url, text, sitename, siteURL)
	&#171;thread.easycall ("user.html.addToSearchEngine", &#123;title, url, text, sitename, siteURL})
	&#171;return (true)
</pre><p>

DISCLAIMER: not my own work! Whoever posted this first: 1) thanks, and 2) please identify yourself!<p>

This script works fine, but chokes on anything longer than a 'normal' page length, with a Betty/XML error. Might work for you, though - -<p>

Still digging, you betcha.
