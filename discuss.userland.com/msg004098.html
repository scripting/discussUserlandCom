Perhaps Lawrence will be able to pick up the ball here and give you the modified version of the script that he uses for Tomalak's Realm.<p>

My script only assumed that the text, when converted to a string, would have double-carriage-returns separating each item. It then parsed the HTML to produce the XML. I never would have done it if it meant changing the way I enter text for Scripting News.<p>

Here's a <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/raw/messages/0004098/enclosureBits">pointer</a> to the script I'm using, but I think you'd be much better off getting the script from Lawrence if he's willing to share.<p>
