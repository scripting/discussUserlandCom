It's funny this came up today, because I was looking over the old MacBird site (one of *our* directions that didn't get finished) and read the <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/frontier/macbird/story.html">story</a> I wrote about how we got trapped in bugs in the Mac OS Component Manager for all of 1993, trying to work around them.<p>

The fact is, back in those days, Apple wasn't really doing operating systems, they were doing science experiments. Unfortunately users and the press can't tell the difference.
