Further, there's a big base of support for XML-RPC, and all those developers could have chosen CORBA, perhaps there's a reason they went with XML-RPC? Finally, the two ways of communicating can and probably will be bridged.<p>

I guess the final point is this -- it may look like we just made the decision to go with XML-RPC, but in fact the decision was made in early 1998 and we've been developing it ever since.
