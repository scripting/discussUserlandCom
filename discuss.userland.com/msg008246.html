i was faced with the question, do i want a favorites (subscribed) 
list, or do i want a "unsubscribed" list?  <p>

i tried both, and found that one of the byproducts of keeping an
"unsubscribed" list is that new channels are automatically
subscribed allowing me to see new channels and immediately make a 
decision about subscribing or not.  <p>

With the subscription model, I need to proactively find new channels.<p>

I'd be interested to see what others think.<p>

Thanks.<p>
