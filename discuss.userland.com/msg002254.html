You can read and write them to disk files easily, with a command. I don't know if it's possible to embed an entire hash structure and serialize it to disk. That would be nice, but even if possible, would not be very efficient, since you'd have to load (deserialize) the entire structure into memory at once, unlike Frontier's table-at-a-time approach.
