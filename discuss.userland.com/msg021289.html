<p>Something you wrote me some weeks ago - after a discussion we had in the xsl-list - has been helping me to keep things in perspective. I was frequently having those "discontinuities of lucidity" and you told me about a culture of not taking remarks as personal attacks and, instead, just focus on learning from them when possible.</p>
<p>Your text had the advantage of being much more down to earth, which makes it easier to remember when I am not in such a philosophical mood.<br />=:o)

<p>Have fun,<br />
