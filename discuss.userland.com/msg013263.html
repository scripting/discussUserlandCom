Combination of a "neatly categorised links" (albeit not as many as Yahoo!) and a rating scheme built on the community of interest, as defined by users, using technology from GlobalBrain.net (a NZ company).<p>

I'm biased, to be sure... I work there (though not on search).<p>

I do think Google is excellent, esp. the Google Scout feature, but Snap.com has some nifty search features, one of which is what you're asking for.<p>

The other two are a unique keyword suggester (different from the competition -- shows you what OTHER terms people used to find the same site) and LiveDirectory (livedirectory.snap.com), a user-submitted directory of sites with the same ratings technology applied.
