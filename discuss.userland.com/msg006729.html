I would avoid to cache the result of such a macro.<p>

I think the major use of this kind of caching would be for parts of the page with simple but frequently used macros - like imageRef, stylesheet etc. A macro that collects data from several different locations are more likely to be the "live" material of the page. <p>

(I could imagine a setup where such a macro checks the time-stamps of it's sources, and flushes the cache if anything has changed, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort.)
