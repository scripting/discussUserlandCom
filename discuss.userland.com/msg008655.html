The standard Python src distribution will compile on Mac OS X Server w/o modification...but from what I'm told (I'm not a unix person, so bare w/ me) this is a static compile, and Zope wants Python dynamically compiled.<p>

As the notes above say, It can be done--but they loose me at "symliked the heck out of it"...cause I wouldn't know where to start linking.<p>

I'm sure once Zope 2 settles into a stable release, some one will mess with providing a binary or something w/ a pre-compiled Python.<p>

For what it's worth, Zope/Python work great on LinuxPPC.<p>

We'll see...
