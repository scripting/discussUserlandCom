It runs very fast on machines that (at least in web serving circles) are very old.  It's free.  It's small.  It's easy to configure.  It comes with source.<p>

If you mull over the code for a while, you will realize that the author has done some wonderful things in its design.<p>

You can learn about the guts at www.imatix.com, or just about the server at www.xitami.com
