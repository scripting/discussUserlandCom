Well, I've started to think that Third Voice in itself
is good idea, but that they're focussing on the bad parts
just to impress their VCs.<p>

Don't know their business plan (cannot really tell
if they have one ;-), but I'd focus on quality if I
were them: scrap the 'public grafitti on anyone's site'
aspect, and focus on 'group annotations on the web'
and 'discussion/annotation on registered sites'.<p>

But maybe that's what their competitors do?<p>

<i>they will always be the VC firm of cesspools</i><p>

Well, if you plan to get all your cash from the stock
market, rather than from paying customers, a large number
of one-time-and-never-ever-again customers is probably
better than a small number of quality users :-(
