It is cross-platform (although originally for Mac) and nearly full-featured. It is open-source freeware, distributed under the GNU GPL.<p>

It supports multiple simultaneous connections, chat, news, messages, file management, downloading, account management, and it's extensible thru "plugins" written in UserTalk. A Hotline Bot is already available as plugin for MfHC.<p>
