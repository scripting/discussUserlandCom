Any ordinary human being who looks at my site with TV
enabled will get something that may have additional
content <i>mixed with my own</i>, content that may be
"unlawful, harassing, libelous, invasive of another's
privacy, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene
or otherwise objectionable".  The changes are done using
software provided by Third Voice, and using data from their
databases.  IANAL, but I'm not that sure that a court
wouldn't agree with me if I sued TV for violating my
copyright, privacy, or my moral rights.<p>

(if you are a lawyer, please point me to any references
that covers this situation!)<p>

...<p>

or to look at it from the other side: if TV thought
that arbitrary annotations on copyrighted material
were clearly legal, why on earth did they add this
text to their terms of service:<p>

<i>"User agrees not to transmit through the Service any material that is unlawful, harassing, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene or otherwise objectionable. User further agrees not to transmit any material that encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national or international law or regulation."</i>
