The light bulb at the left is, I presume, an indicator of whether there are new posts since my last visit, or perhaps posts I haven't read. The "posts" column is what I was really asking for: total number of responses, responses-to-responses, etc. started by the "new topic" post. "Last post" is a quick way to see if a thread is still active or has died away. "Moderator" does not seem relevant to UserLand's discussion group.<p>

Is clearer now, yes?<p>
