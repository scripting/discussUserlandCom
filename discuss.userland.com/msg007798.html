I called it with these parameters...<p>

tcp.httpClient (server:"208.8.205.165", port:8080, path:"/~ural/search?today", cookiesOn:true)<p>

user.webBrowser.cookies.["208.8.205.165"] contains...

/  table:
   WB-BoardId  table:
      expires  date: 6/25/99; 2:55:52 PM
      secure   boolean: false
      value string:  3
   WB-Pass  table:

What I got back was an error page saying that I needed to log in to the site.  This indicated to me, for some reason, the site didn't get my cookies.  Time to start diggin'!<p>

After stepping through httpClient I discovered that it never included my cookies.  OK.  Ready to follow along?
<pre>
edit
   tcp.httpClient<p>

find the line
   local (host = "Host: " + server)<p>

look at the if block immediately after.  keep this in mind<p>

find the line
   if host endsWith nameOf (adrdomain^)
</pre>
As far as I can see, this check will always be false if port is anything other than 80.  So in my script, host is &quot;Host: 208.8.205.165:8080&quot; and nameOf (adrdomain^) is &quot;208.8.205.165&quot;.<p>

I found a temporary work around.  That was to change...<p>

if host endsWith nameOf (adrdomain^)<p>

...to..<p>

if host contains nameOf (adrdomain^)<p>


Of course, I could be all wet and not called httpClient correctly.  So it that's the case, please correct me.
