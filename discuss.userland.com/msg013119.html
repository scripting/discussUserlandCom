When the Web started taking off, I was an OS/2 user. There wasn't very much in the way of documentation etc. (I don't think Ed Kroll's book was out yet.) I went to the bookshop and found Adam Engst's book on how to get your Mac onto the Net, and what to do once you managed to climb aboard.<p>

Now OS/2 had nothing to do with the Mac, but Adam's book told me what I had to do (back then the TCP/IP stack for OS/2 was a separate purchase) and what sort of applications to go looking for.<p>

The Mac crowd helped me get aboard, and I've always been grateful to them for that.<p>

The Mac newsgroups were also friendlier. The OS/2 crowd spent so much time attacking MS and not tolerating anything less than rabid anti-MS views, that I eventually got disgusted and dropped OS/2. (And I was a member of Team OS/2, giving up a week of vacation to help guerilla market OS/2 at Comdex Canada.)
