The hurt is self-induced. These are just little ones and zeros on a magnetic surface being transmitted by EMF or something like that. There's no actual matter being moved here. No real danger.</i><p>

I need to partially disagree.<p>

From one perspective; Why are there slander laws?  What you say, can hurt.  It can hurt reputation.  Brands are built on people's perceived notions of reputation.  <p>

From another perspective; Personally, I realize how we react to what is said to us is under our control.  Between stimulus and response, we have the freedom to choose.  That is the essence of proactivity.  <p>

Many people, however, do not feel this way.  They blame the stimulus directly for their response and forget their freedom to choose. Emotion can hurt.<p>

From another perspective;  If you can form real friendships that are purely cyber (which I have a horrible inability to do - probably a good thing too), then almost definitely you can be hurt by those little ones and zeroes - or more accurately - the emotions you attach to them.  <p>

BTW, this has been a huge week around here from my view.  I really like ManilaExpress and the Search engine is just about perfect!  I posted to my website that you are practicing the Scripting News tagline.  <i>Thanks</i>!
