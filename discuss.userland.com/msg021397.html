It's
pedantic and boring and completely orthogonal to your desire to
get creativity back into the world's discussions about software.
Nonetheless, if you want to know what the "Open Source community"
thinks that "Open Source" means, then that document is <b>part</b> of
the answer.  See www.opensource.org.<p>

However, you have already noted that this definition is only part of the story.  Yes, a lot of people put "riders" on it which IMHO do not belong.  Being anti-Microsoft is one of those riders.  One of the major purposes of my article was to express the need I see for Open Source people to strip out the junk dogma which doesn't belong.<p>

However, put yourself in Stallman's shoes for a moment.  From his point of view, being anti-Microsoft <b>does</b> belong.  Freedom is more important to him than the process of creating cool software which people actually use to get their problems solved.  Microsoft is a clear obstacle to Stallman's concept of freedom.  (But not mine.)<p>

Re freedom:  Yes, freedom is an idea which is biggger.  Richard bends the meaning a bit, causing some damage to the true meaning of the word, IMHO.<p>

Re luxury:  Yes, I suppose you're right.  The <b>best</b> software developers are only interested in creating software which people actually use, and money is an important component of their equation, but a secondary one.<p>

BTW, when you posted your example a couple weeks ago and asked if it was Open Source, my first reaction was to say that it was <b>obviously</b> Open Source.  I almost didn't see a need for the question.  Anybody in the Open Source community who disputes that probably needs to take a step back and figure out what's really important.
