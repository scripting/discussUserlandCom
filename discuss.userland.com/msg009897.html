First, the correct solution is to beef up the website so that it (1) has the answers and solutions and (2) is sufficiently easy to navigate that the customer can find said answers.<p>

Second, having email support does you absolutely no good if the responses are clueless. And yet, Iomega might well get a plus point in some of the currently popular surveys of Web customer suport. It offered email and it replied pretty quickly. Whether the customer's problem was solved is never counted!
