mainResponder.members.getProfile   (When used with MTTF)
   
   This returns the Queue object.  Which contains all the MTTF messages the user has.  This isn't necessary and even 8-10 messages is a pretty big dump.  Takes up bandwidth, memory, browser object space....<p>

   We really need one more parameter that tells the handler where to start from and proceed down.<p>

   <b>RECOMMENDED CHANGE<b></b></b><p>

   mainResponder.members.getProfile(userGroup, userKey, userPassword, profileStart)
         &#123;
         for this group/user
               if not defined (profileGroup) 
                     Return it ALL!!!
               else 
                    Return everything from the "identifer" inside the  param profileStart (which could be a table or a single element name)  down the hierarchy.  
         }<p>

(Although this doesn't have anything to do with membership RPC handlers)<p>

mailtothefuture.getAllMessages <p>

   Same root problem.  What if users have 100s of messages, and I just want the 
   new ones since a date, or the ones that haven't occured yet.<p>

   This solution is a little tricker, I'd like to set selection parameters in a struct.<p>

   <b>RECOMMENDED CHANGE<b></b></b><p>

   mailtothefuture.getAllMessages(userKey, userPassword, selectStruct)
         &#123;
         for this user
               if not defined (selectStruct) 
                     Return all messages for this user
               else 
                    Return all messages that match selection criteria in the selectStruct  
         }<p>


   (Sample selection criteria)<p>

   <selectStruct>
         <params>
         <param><name>status</name><value> = pending</value></param>
         <param><name>insertionDate</name><value> > 01/01/99</value></param>
         </params>
   </selectStruct><p>

   or some such mechanism for conveying the selection criteria.  If you have a better 
   format solution, it's welcome as long as it does the job.<p>

   This would return all new messages added since 01/01/99 that have not been sent 
   yet.<p>


Of course this also opens a disussion on what about how the response is sorted....
maybe add to the selectStruct:<p>

         <param><name>sort1</name><value>subject</value></param><p>

If you need more spec, dissussion let me know.  <p>
