Your last statement alarms me:  "I guess my local bookmark file is full of illegal links as well....".<p>

We have to remember that because someone objects it doesn't mean that it is illegal to do counter to their wishes. Stamp out this kind of thought fascism. These issues will be settled by lawsuits and if precedent regarding fair use is any guide, the outcome is likely to be that claims such as InfoWorld's will be thrown out of court.
