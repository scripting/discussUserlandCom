SGI designed a cutting edge windows NT PC designed for Windows NT 5. It had USB support, no legacy ISA, No IRQ's, 64bit PCI and SGI graphics pipelines. The only problem was the MS could not deliver Windows NT 5/2000 on time.<p>

Some PHB at SGI was wooed by MS, and actully believed that NT 5 would ship in a reasonable time. They announced an NT 5 strategy, designed a PC to fit that strategy, and discovered that they were way ahead of the curve. Finnally, they get the idea that waiting is only killing the company. The make a custom version of NT4 with usb and other support to get the PC out the door. The PC requires an SGI custom version on NT4, and custom SGI service packs.<p>

Only problem is that the custom SGI graphic chip set is now outdated. There still is no USB for NT4, PC's still use IRQ's, and more importantly, SGI saw the light, and said NT is not the wave of our future.
