It has messed around with the calendaring features for groups, and has generally suffered the same declines in quality as Deja.com. I quite like <a href="http://www.smartgroups.com">SmartGroups</a>, but I don't think any free commercial provider is going to do the job ideally. Have you seen <A href="http://www.caucus.com"</a>Caucus</a>, though?
