It's actually very nice, and starting to slowly close in on some of the core strengths of EditThisPage, but not yet approaching the substance of Manila itself.<p>

I love the drag/drop of slides in the browser. Very slick.<p>

I must admit, this is getting <i>really</i> interesting. I can now get a full-blown DV setup for under $2k, with very nice editing tools that my wife would feel comfortable using, and for a bit of money ($1/MB/year) get enough Akamai-enabled bandwidth to host movies for my family scattered around the US.<p>

Apple's developed a new talent: finding prices for things that at first seem too high (iDisk space is ~100x the cost of HD space), yet still manage to get you to open your wallet after you've talked yourself into it a bit (that quality of hosting isn't much cheaper for small volume).
