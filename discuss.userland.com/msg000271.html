Having used it for a while, it doesn't bother me and I don't really see how either way is better.<p>

Unfortunately, the way that SDI works under Windows isn't like the way MacOS works; the MacOS concept of a "layer" that holds all the windows of one application is very convenient at times. I think the advantages and disadvantages of all the various schemes (MacOS, SDI, MDI) tend to even out.
