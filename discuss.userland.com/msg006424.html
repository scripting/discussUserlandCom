Maybe a combination of a community category for comments plus voting on a per-comment basis could work.  It might reduce the noise by sending the more-interesting (more-often-voted interesting) comments to the top of the community's category. And then you'd see those first and never see the dorkcomments unless you scrolled down.<p>

This would be kind of minimal moderation, but it would reduce the work enough so more people could take part in the moderation and produce a kind of 'collective filter' on the comments.
