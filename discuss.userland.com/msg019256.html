<b>Radio Radio</b> from "This Years Model"<p>

I was tuning in the shine on the light night dial<BR> 
doing anything my radio advised <BR> 
with every one of those late night stations <BR> 
playing songs bringing tears to me eyes <BR> 
I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver <BR> 
when the switch broke 'cause it's old <BR> 
They're saying things that I can hardly believe. <BR> 
They really think we're getting out of control. <BR> 
Radio is a sound salvation <BR> 
Radio is cleaning up the nation <BR> 
They say you better listen to the voice of reason <BR> 
But they don't give you any choice <BR> 
'cause they think that it's treason. <BR> 
So you had better do as you are told. <BR> 
You better listen to the radio. <BR> 
<BR> 
I wanna bite the hand that feeds me. <BR> 
I wanna bite that hand so badly. <BR> 
I want to make them wish they'd never seen me. <BR> 
<BR> 
Some of my friends sit around every evening <BR> 
and they worry about the times ahead <BR> 
But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference <BR> 
and the promise of an early bed <BR> 
You either shut up or get cut up; <BR> 
they don't wanna hear about it. <BR> 
It's only inches on the reel-to-reel. <BR> 
And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools <BR> 
tryin' to anaesthetise the way that you feel <BR> 
<BR> 
[Chorus] <BR> 
<BR> 
Wonderful radio <BR> 
Marvelous radio <BR> 
Wonderful radio <BR> 
Radio, radio...<BR>
