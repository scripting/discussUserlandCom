Just curious<p><p>

The problem you experienced is a known bug with the Compaq instructions for setting up the network card that NT uses to get going.<p><p>

I'm a little surprised you're having this problem, and getting no help on it from Compaq.  I had the same problem in May, and was able to find the fix on Compaq's web site.<p><p>

No question: big pain in the butt.<p><p>

If you'd like some help, when I get in the office tomorrow, I'll check my notes and find the fix.</p></p></p></p></p>
