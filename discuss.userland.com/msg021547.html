flames in public forums, but I didn't write it.  So here's
a capsule version which is flawed by brevity.  (Without
discussing exceptions thoroughly, it might ring false.)<p>

A few years ago, I asked myself what I could do to actively
prevent others from taking offense from my writing.  I studied
my past failures for clues, and came up with a theory that
tends to work for me.  But it's slightly hard to apply this
theory, because it needs exceptions requiring judgment.<p>

I decided most problems stemmed from discussing the other
person posting in the forum.  In fact, mentioning the other
person in any way at all is problematic, including the
implicit 'you' in imperative sentences.  Everything you
say about a person spins their reputation and/or position.<p>

Usually the other person doesn't like this.  Sometimes they
don't like it a lot.  If there's a way to read a negative
connotation about themselves, a reader very often will.
If one does not even refer to another person, this makes
it harder for them to do it.  But no references is hard.<p>

If there's any possible way to see a reference in text,
a person will typically see it or infer it.  In particular,
folks might substitute themselves for any other referenced
person or group, assuming you have merely changed the names.
See, this is pretty hard.  And exceptions are still needed.<p>

For example, in a conversation one is responding to another
person's remarks, right?  So you must implicitly reference
them by how you quote, paraphrase, or edit their remarks.
You can even err by quoting some and not all of another
person's words, if the missing context was important.<p>

The only safe way to respond is by quoting exactly those
parts you want to discuss, without paraphrasing, and
without spinning what the other person meant by them.
And when you respond, you must try hard to minimize 
direct and indirect references to the other person.<p>

If possible, say what's on your mind that's related to the
material being quoted, without addressing either the
original text or it's author.  This style suggests roughly
"that makes me think of something I want to talk about."
This way, one talks about oneself and not the other guy.<p>

(In fact, you are your own best punching bag.  Use 
yourself whenever a standin dummy is really necessary.  Don't
pick on some poor innocent bystander, especially if humor
is involved which they might not get.  Unfortunately this
can make folks suppose you are more self centric than is
the case.  But every strategy has a flaw somewhere.)<p>

There are many reasons why it might be impossible or just
undesirable to avoid refering to other folks.  If the topic
of discussion is the other folks, then there's not much
choice.  Also, suppressing any refs to other folks can force
highly unnatural sentence constructions one should avoid.<p>

In a bad case, the topic of discussion is the company
which employs the person to whom you are speaking.  Then
it will be very hard to avoid any references to the other
person, at least by proxy through the company as a group.
The other person must make a suitable allowance for this.<p>

In the worst case, the topic concerns criticism of the
company employing the other person, in which case it can
be very hard to avoid seeming to flame the other guy.
However, there's a general approach for negating refs.<p>

When you reference another person and wish you could
avoid it but can't, simply disclaim the reference.  This
is particularly important when the other person might
infer something you have no intention of implying.
This is only a last resort, since the other guy might
not believe the disclaimer.  So caveat emptor.<p>

That's enough for now.  I'll see if I forgot to mention
anytthing important later.  Just remember the goal is to
refer to other folks much less than you otherwise would
if you were not paying attention.  Really work at it.
But you need not slavishly eradicate everything.<p>

Also, feel free to refer to other folks when you have
something human and nice to say.  And don't forget to
practice random acts of kindness.
