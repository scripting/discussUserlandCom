That might eliminate the need for a Frontier run-time. You could create your objects in Frontier (maybe on your server) and could then use any WDDX-enabled language on the client to get the objects (via TCP/IP? with RPC?) and act upon them. The downside is that you'd have to use two different languages. The upside is that there's bound to be some MS/ASP/Perl program that does what you need your run-time to do and it'd be easy to change to something else when a better solution came along later (including, obviously, a Frontier run-time.)
