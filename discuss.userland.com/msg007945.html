As a reader I want uniformity in presentation. I could see that clearly when InfoWorld.Com changed their format. They broke my routine. I could quickly find out what's new on their site, now I can't. For now at least they lost me. I wish they'd support RSS or <scriptingNews> and be done with it. <p>

That said, there's no way anyone can make your page look like anyone else's. I'm happy to get the value from Jorn Barger's wisdom thru the magic of RSS. We can both be happy.
