That's not really what I was looking for. I suppose one could use Frontier's application scripting abilities to control PageMaker and Acrobat Distiller to "render" PDF on demand, but I was hoping do actually generate the PDF file within Frontier. I know that Adobe FrameMaker+SGML can render a SGML document to HTML, PDF, Postscript, or XML, but it's probably a nontrivial job to get Frontier to do the same sort of thing.<p>

But thanks for the pointer nevertheless. I learned something useful, even if it wasn't quite what I'd been looking for.<p>
