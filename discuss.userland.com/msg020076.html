<a href="http://qube.weblogs.com/">Qube Quorner</a>, run by Luke Tymowski.<p>

<a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/zopeNewbies/">Zope Newbies</a>, run by Jeff Shelton.<p>

<a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Hack The Planet</a>, run by Wes Felter.<p>

I read these sites every day, and learn tremendously from them. They are not politically neutral, each has a voice, and an attitude, but they're all honest and run by people who write code and like to share. I can't recommend them too highly.
