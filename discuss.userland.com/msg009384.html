Nope! I - for one - rely on sites such as Scripting News to point me towards information I may find useful, interesting, or both.<p>

No, I wouldn't read Infoworld unless someon pointed to it.<p>

Think about all those sites I've visited, and all those ads I've seen, by following links from <b>trusted sources</b>!
