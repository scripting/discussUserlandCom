<br>
I have a script on a Mac.<br>
'Marvellous!' I hear you all cry.<br>
Well, yes; but for one thing.<br>
I need to use that same piece of code on a PC and herein lies a problem.<br>
The code in question steps through the items in a table and performs a process on what it finds within that table. &nbsp;The problem occurs when I 'copy and paste' (via Zip Disk) the code from the Mac to the PC.<br>
I import my script, open it and think to myself (I do a lot of that) 'Ah, no problem, just find and replace the MacHD:applications:blah:blah path with 'D:Frontierguest databasessmashingsite' and it should work.<br>
Wrong. &nbsp;For some reason, I get a coercion (hmm, looks Spanish to me) error telling me that the path I have given is not in the database.<br>
Anyone know why? &nbsp;Is The parser getting confused with the slashquote and thinking that it is a part of the path?<br>
<br>
I asked a colleague to perform the same import and change procedure (without telling him exactly what I did). &nbsp;He came up with the same problem.<br>
So. Maybe the platform divide has not yet been fully bridged?<br>
Hopefully, it is a simple matter of a syntax misinterpretation on my part.<p>

Have fun folks,<p>
