It totally screams! The secret, of course, is using overclocked Celerons rather than expensive Pentium II or Pentium III CPUs.<p>

Here're the specs:<p>

2       Intel Celeron 300A (PPGA) microprocessors,
2       MSI-6905 (rev1.1) PPGA->Slot1 adapters,
1       Epox KP6-BS motherboard,
256MB   PC100 SDRAM (Micron),
1       Creative Labs Baster TNT video card (OEM version),
1       Western Digital Expert 18GB IDE (ATA66) hard drive,
1       AOpen 40X IDE CD-ROM,
1       Teac floppy drive,
1       CreativeLabs PCI 128 voice sound card,
1       3Com Fast Ethernet XL (3C905B) network card,
1       Antec KS-188 full tower case (13 drive bays! Yahoo!)<p>


This thing is absolutely rock solid with the CPUs overclocked to 464MHz. The secret to it's speed though is the ultra-fast hard drive (7200rpm, 2MB buffer).<p>

At this point, Intel has stopped making the Celeron 300A so you'd need to choose an alternative CPU. Given the difficulty of overclocking other Celerons, it might be better to stick with non-overclocked Celerons...
