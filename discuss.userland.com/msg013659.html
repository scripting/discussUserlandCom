My Netscape Network doesn't like it -- it doesn't get through their submit page. I even provided an alternate DTD but apparently their parser has hardcoded the RSS 0.91 DTD. Oh well. It's easy enough to export two versions of the file (foo.rss091 and foo.rss perhaps).<p>

I still haven't tested it in my.userland but Dave assures me it'll work; if not, I'll post a followup.<p>

By the way, should it be called "date" or "pubDate"? I like "date" cause it's simple, but perhaps some day there will be other sorts of dates one would want to attach to an item...<p>
