Ick, that does sound offensive.  I wonder if the license or copyright made any difference at all in those cases.  Was it only done to public domain goods?<p>

Passing something off as your own is the most offensive part, since clearly this is misrepresentation.  Mere redistribution for one's own purpose, when the product is public domain, doesn't seem a problem.
