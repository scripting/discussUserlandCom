Here here! Not everyone is on line all the time. As discussed recently, one of the benefits of email digests is "all today's mail in one convenient package". That's something missing on this DG.<p>

But it wouldn't be difficult within Frontier (I presume) to create (on the fly) "summary" pages of various kinds such as: (i) a summary of today's messages, either sorted chronologically or by thread; (ii) a summary of a particular thread (over its full duration or "from here onwards").<p>

These summary pages would have all messages on one page and would be formatted for easy saving and offline reading and/or for easy printing and offline reading (and I'm not kidding, I often print email digests 2-up or 4-up on a page and read them at leisure; maybe others do the same?).<p>

A further option would be that you could request the summary/digest pages be emailed to you either by individual request or regularly, e.g. daily. Surely that wouldn't be difficult either?
