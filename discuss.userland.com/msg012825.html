I posted a DG message about porting Frontier over to Linux about a month ago at <a href="http://linux.userland.com">Your Linux Site</a> and never got an answer. <p>

Just my 2cents, I think porting Frontier to Linux would be a godsend. For one the Mac OS is not stable enough to make a good webserver platform. As far as NT, I have yet to try. But Linux is free, stable and an all around damn good platform for webserving. I can just imagine a Frontier driven site that never goes down and is easy to manitain. Talk about "Nirvana".
