I'm still brainstorming here.<p>

So DW could make changes dynamically to the local version of a site, but to get it uploaded to a server will need another "bucketeer" in the bucket brigade.<p>

But DW _can_ open any browser URL you ask it to - so if there is a way  to pass on the message to another thingy via an http request - dw could do this.<p>

Sorry if this is too far off-topic - I'm thinking the more DW could do, the more Frontier could tell it to do!<p>

The docs for DW are here:
