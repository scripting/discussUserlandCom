<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/current_issue/article/0,1212,11092,00.html">PC WORLD reviews</a> Lotus QuickPlace. "Given all its success with Notes, you might expect Lotus to make a compelling Web-based workgroup application. Not exactly. Judging from our experience with a prerelease version, the company's new QuickPlace workgroup program--though miles ahead of its predecessor, Lotus Instant Teamroom--still lags several steps behind the competition."<p>

Robert Cringely: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit19990701.html">Let It Ride</a>. "Spend some time around some Internet zillionaires and you'll come away with the sense that they don't really believe their wealth. Maybe it isn't real. Certainly it is considered in bad taste to actually buy things with the money. Instead, the archetype is David Filo of Yahoo, who lives in the same grotty apartment and drives the same grotty car as he did as a Stanford graduate student." <i>Maybe they love the work they do? Money just isn't that important, IMHO.</i><p>

This afternoon on the Script Meridian Community list I responded to speculation on what Manila is. "Manila is not a workstation product, it runs on the server. It is designed to be very easy, content management for the rest of us, no scripting. But you get the major benefits of Frontier, separation of form from content, separate spaces for stories and graphics. Templates, and glossary (in Manila glossary entries are called shortcuts). All configuration and writing is done thru the browser. It's not ready for prime-time yet, since simplicity is the central goal, it can't be released in rough form. Also, it's a development platform, you can customize it ad infinitum."
