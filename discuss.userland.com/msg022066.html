Robert's 7-year-old boy Patrick came too. <a href="http://paulandrews.manilasites.com/">Paul Andrews</a> and his weird but lovable poodle-like dog Maggie. Woz has a full video arcade in his basement and an indoor-outdoor swimming pool. Andy Hertzfeld of Eazel says they're going to use "XML-RPC".

It's amazing how prior art gets lost in history, and how lost we got when the dotcom boom hit. We should have retooled the whole productivity app business. But it's not too late now. Flash is a sexy rendering-runtime environment. Hey PDF is pretty popular too. What about SVG?<br><br>My uncle has a new <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/vavaBusinessCard.jpg">business card</a>. Coool!<br><br>
