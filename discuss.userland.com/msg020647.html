At one point there was an ODB Engine library that allowed access to Frontier ODBs, but I think the file format has changed since then.<p>

I don't really see a need for such tools or docs. If I wanted to export data from an ODB I could just write a script (probably to convert it to some XML format), if such scripts aren't already out there. If I was building an app from scratch I would just use an existing DB engine.
