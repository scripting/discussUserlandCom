When I went to college, it wasn't the Jehovah's Witnesses or the Mormons going door to door, it was the NSA Buddhists.<p>

I appreciate Buddhism, but the "chanting for personal gain" stuff that they talked about ("I wanted a sports car, so I chanted, and I got it!") really turned me off.<p>

Mind you, I had an older sister go off the deep end into radical evangelistic Christianity, so perhaps I'm just conditioned to react negatively to people trying to convince me to believe a certain way.<p>
