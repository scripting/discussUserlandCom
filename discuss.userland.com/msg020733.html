I find it more pleasent then reading from paper, because:<br><br><p>

  1) I can use the largest font size and take off my glasses.<br>
  2) It's easier to see with the lights off and the backlighting on, then a book is with the overhead light (no shadows, for instance).
<br><br>
I also appreciate being able to read while I walk.  I find it difficult to turn pages while walking, and smaller text bounces around too much.  But pushing buttons on a visor is no problem at all.
