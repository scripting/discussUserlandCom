PHB: The MS representative I talked to last week said that MS outlook has all the features of XXX, and XXX, and it comes free with MS Office.<p>

IT: It's my ass on the line. Outlook is free, but we have to buy a user license for everyone accessing the server. And a full copy of office for everyone, even if they only use word.<p>

PHB: But Outlook is free, right? Office is below the big hassle purchase order price, and we need a server, so MS is the best solution.<p>


I tried to get an office that was just opening up to use framemaker, and notes. Of course a concurrent license of frame runs $1200, and notes runs about the same cost as exchange. Office came with every computer ordered through the gateway/dell so it was a no go. And a people spent hours reformatting the documents to specs, but that was a billable expense.
