There is no reason for Pike not to keep its connection open to the server.<p>

My point with FTP, is that once I FTP to a server, I can put data on the server, and I can get data from the server.  To shretch the analogy, Pike puts data on the server, and the Server puts data in pike, rather than pike getting data from the server.<p>

The only problem with Pike(more it is an XML-RPC problem) is that it uses a Web server as a communication method.  A web client doesn't have good conversations, it has bursts of questions and answers.
