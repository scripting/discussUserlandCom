I went to MacMall and when you buy a new G3 workstation you can get a USB-Native modem.  Anyone with a serial modem they wanted to use could also get a serial-to-USB adapter.<p>

The only issue right now is with the modem that goes into the 70 pin slot on the new G3 workstation motherboard.  I don't believe Apple is holding the modem back indefinitely... it's probably a supply problem at this point, or a holdover from their new internal systems changeover.<p>

Aren't I the trusting one? ;-)  Bleeding 6 colours and everything!<p>
