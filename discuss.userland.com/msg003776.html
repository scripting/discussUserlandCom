<blockquote><i>Do I understand this correctly, that adrCallback is the address of a routine on the client machine which is called by the server when the client connects?<p>

Yes.</i>

OK, a followup question: is <i>adrCallback</i> called when the server recieves the request from the client or after the server is finished processing the request?<p>

The reason I ask is that a client was interested in rendering entire sites on a server by XML-RPC requests and we wanted some way to notify the client once the rendering was completed. I believe asynchronous XML-RPC, or a similar implementation, is the solution. I was going to do some research in the feasibility of adding this feature to XML-RPC, but it looks like you've saved me the time.
