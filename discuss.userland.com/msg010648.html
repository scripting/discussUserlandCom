This is what I immediately thought of when I read Dave's original post on this. It's something that I've thought before, too. It seems like a script to purge mail by some criteria in the brand name mailers, however useful, is really just a band-aid on the real problem. That email programs are weak database wannabes. They fall down under the pressure of large amounts of data.<p>

What I've done for years now with Eudora Lite is to export <b>huge</b> folders of email to single large text files (Eudora will do this). I save these huge files and grep through them once in a very great while if the need arises. Not an ideal solution, but it gets it out of my mailer's hair.<p>

This, I think, is where Eudora et al should be moving towards. Replacing their local storage systems with real database while keeping the nice front end in place.<p>

Kinda makes you wonder how nice life would be if Frontier was playing the email client for you, hm? Storing everything in the odb. Scripts to purge would be a non-issue. Or if Frontier was playing the database role for a thin gui app who behaved like Eudora or Outlook.
