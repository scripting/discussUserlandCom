If true, this shows some admirable restraint on a man who wields such power. A couple of thoughts...<p>

1) The obvious adage comes to mind: "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely". TBL certainly holds absolute power within the W3C. This may be an interesting study over time, because from what I have gleaned, the image of TBL is generally that of someone uncorruptible (and I certainly have no knowledge to the contrary).<p>

2) On the more mundane side, but not unrelated to #1, even if he has not used this power up till now, the <i>threat</i> of the veto (either implicit or explicit) may well have exerted influence any number of times.
