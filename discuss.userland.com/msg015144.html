Found another problem! Links of the form http://somesite.com weren't being counted. (Note the missing trailing slash.) I just added code that allows these kinds of links to be counted too.<p>

Now that change *did* shake things up. Blogger is now the number one link. Congrats to <a href="http://www.evhead.com/images/cam/pyracam.jpg">Pyra</a>!<p>

I expected a skew toward UserLand-hosted sites, but Camworld, Evhead, Robot Wisdom, Kottke, Megnut, and Memepool are in the top 10. <p>

However, <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">#2</a>, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">#3</a> and <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">#9</a> are UserLand sites. ";->"<p>

The list is rebuilt every morning at 2AM Pacific. It shows the most popular 100 links among the 471 sites scanned by Weblogs.Com. The number in the third column is the count of times the URL appeared in single or double-quotes in all the weblogs.<p>

There's no logic or weighting as on <a href="http://beebo.org/metalog/ratings/">Beebo</a>, or any attempt to figure out what's fair, even pointers coming from a site to itself are counted.<p>

<a href="http://www.weblogs.com/stats/findinweblogs?q=weblogs.com%2Fhotlist">Seven sites</a> are pointing to the hotlist.<p>

I think I had a dream about this once. <i>You may remember a few years ago when an obscure physicist was experimenting with a crazy new Internet service that no one thought they wanted -- it was called "The World-Wide Web".</i> Right on Wes. Tell it like it is.<p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$312">An Italian review of EditThisPage</a>: "Quanti mantengono un sito sono ben consapevoli delle attenzioni che ci&ograve; comporta. La manutenzione &egrave; fatta quasi sempre manualmente, con editor e programmi Ftp e i grattacapi non mancano mai, soprattutto quando il numero di pagine da gestire &egrave; elevato."<p>

Marc Canter: <a href="http://marcsvoice.editthispage.com/">So many frames, so little time</a>. "With Photoshop or Premiere anybody can make a digital movie today. That power in the hands of the right people - can create a whole new artform - a new way of communicating - and generate loads of new jobs and wealth."<p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$309">The cowskull debate</a> continues on kottke.org. It's not actually that much of an issue anymore because we allow Manila designers to specify the link-to-DG graphic. This is one of the first things we fixed after shipping Manila in December 1999.<p>
