I've done a full system reinstall (8.5.1) and zapped PRAM but am still running into problems.<p>

The only solution I've found is to shut down the machine and leave it untouched for more than an hour. <p>

Has anyone else ever seen something like this before? Any ideas how to fix it?<p>

I'm stumped.<p>
