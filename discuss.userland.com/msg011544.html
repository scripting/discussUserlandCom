I agree that if people <i>want</i> to view the web through this lens, that they should be able to... Imagine if Microsoft were to decide to bundle TV with Windows or Internet Explorer. Imagine if I were a newbie who was curious about TV, and decided to try it out. When I installed TV on my box, I became completely frustrated with the fact that no matter how many times I turned it off, every time I opened up a new browser window, I got the TV bar on the left side of the window (in fully expanded mode, no less). This is one of the primary reasons I uninstalled it.<p>

I'm a user with a high level of technical skill, so it was easy for me to figure out how to remove it, and not to beat a dead horse, but Dave is completely correct in saying that a newbie would have a really hard time figuring out how to uninstall TV. The option to do so was in the Start menu, and it leads you to a form requesting that you tell them why you're uninstalling. Is it even possible to uninstall TV without being connected to the Internet? I don't know.<p>

Also, I've got a large monitor, so it was still possible to surf with the TV bar opened, but I pity the poor newbie with a 15-inch monitor or a laptop who'd be forced to fight with the thing every time they opened a new window.<p>
