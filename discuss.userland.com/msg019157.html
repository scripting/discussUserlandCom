"Obvious to one skilled in the art" is a tricky business.  So much
is obvious to skilled practioners after it's been explained or demonstrated, but they didn't do it.  (Excepting cases where
prior art exists, of course.)<p>

"Seemingly obvious to the patent examiner" is one test.  As was pointed out, the hurdles to challenging a patent may be greater
than the cost of licensing or rerouting.  There are lots of things
that should have been challenged, and thrown out, but never were.
(The patent on the 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>" disk form factor
comes to mind.)<p>

A common corporate response, which Bezos echoes, is to create a
portfolio that provides both offense and defense.
