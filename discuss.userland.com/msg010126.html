BTW, it's now 1:39 PM, and no laptop -- but it's by no means Dell's fault.  FedEx AGAIN is late in delivering it, but this time, I have the tracking scan that it's actually on a van in Manhattan.  (This scan never occurred on the first one.)<p>

Bleah.... I wish that businesses (FedEx here, NOT Dell) wanted to actually satisfy customers these days.  My cousin, who's old enough to be my grandfather and has been in all levels of retail since he was a young man, laments that nobody wants to sell anything anymore.  He's pretty much right on, with the glaring exception I experienced two days ago from Dell.<p>
