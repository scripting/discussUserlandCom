In fact, Napster has much more in common with the actual artists, who, like Courtney Love said, aren't in it for the money (good job, since they're not getting much of it in any case) but for the pure play: the joy and graft of sharing. The question worth asking is possibly: <i>how can Napster avoid becoming the scapegoat for a movement that the industry can't stop?</i><p>
