David Williamson and the folks at Spooky & The Bandit have already made a custom DW2 Property Inspector
              that is designed entirely in Flash... it gives a rich-media presentation for designer choices. It talks to
              Dreamweaver's JavaScript interpreter via "javascript://" protocol URLs within Flash. (iow, the plugin can talk
              to Dreamweaver.) <p>

              So, I suspect that James' existing XML-RPC work may be able to put into an HTML-based Dreamweaver
              component that connects across the net to a Frontier server, feeding data in to the current HTML document.

That's cool JD, do you have a URL for that Flash DW object? The thought of using the shockwave XML-RPC in Dreamweaver dawned on me during my run tonight, thanks for verifying that it might work.
