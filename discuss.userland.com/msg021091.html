Of course, if you do that, you give up all control of your work.  Most people don't want to give up control of major chunks of work - they want to have a say in how that work gets used.  How would you feel if you released the source code to a product and it was rebranded and sold commercially for real money with nothing other than cosmetic (logo) changes?  I think you'd be kicking yourself.  Especially if it were done by a company you found offensive for some reason or other.  If you had renouced all control rights, you couldn't stop it.<p>

You might also want to make money on it at some point down the line - I believe that was your tactic with Frontier for awhile - first few free but when you got to a certain level of sophistication you started charging money for that.  Perfectly reasonable approach.  DragThing went that way and when it went commercial I was totally hooked on the thing - I forked over the cash right away.<p>

RMS uses his license as a club - thats kind of a turnoff and I think the GPL doesn't do a good job of addressing what the Enhydra license calls "larger works". Although there is a version of the GPL called the LGPL (Light or Library GPL) that does provide for creation of larger works that need not have the source code released.  I think that makes much more sense for libraries - its only apps really that need the full GPL protection IMHO.
