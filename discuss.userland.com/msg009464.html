1. I second the earlier request for the ability to read a thread.  Using the back button to make sure I've seen everything is getting old. <g><p>

2. Using a moving average (possibly weighted) instead of absolute read count is more interesting in some ways, and better than just counting reads during the past N days.  I want to know what has been most popular, but also what is most popular *recently*.<p>

Thanks to those who make this all possible.
