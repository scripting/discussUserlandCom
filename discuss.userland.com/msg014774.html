I'm wondering what Shockfusion does that is incompatible with Mac IE? We've heard a lot recently about IE-only features, what are the Netscape only features?</i><p>

IE doesn't open up the navigator.plugins object to javascript (only to VB Script), so client-side javascript can not determine if you have the flash plug-in. <p>

And since the mac version of IE doesn't do VB Script... its a major set-back for IE/Mac when you are dealing with plug-ins.<p>

I haven't heard if this has been resolved in IE 5/Mac.
