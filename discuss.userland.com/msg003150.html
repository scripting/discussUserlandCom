I agree with the fundamental premise that, "[T]here is a significant number of people on the Internet that would love to participate in a bi-directional exchange of content, idea sharing, and commerce. This is just the way humans normally interact."<p>

And while fractional HTTP servers are certainly one way to get there, I think there's another, badly under-utlized approach and that's moderated discussion boards. Moderated, not in the sense of censorship but in the sense of someone ensuring that the signal-to-noise ratio stays extremely low and that discussions are pruned and relocated as appropriate to help people find their way around in the community.<p>

Fractional HTTP servers have some other advantages over discussion boards when viewed broadly (notably, e.g., the ability to arbitrate content at their own front door, relieving the content publisher from knowing about a myriad of devices and their characteristics). But in this case, I suspect that if the objective is broadened ability to contribute to and participate in the gigantic conversation that is the Web, discussion boards can help close that gap significantly and immediately.
