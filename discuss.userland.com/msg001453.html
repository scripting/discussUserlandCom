I'm trying to get the URL of the frontmost window in Internet Explorer.<p>

My code looks like this:<p>

Sub Main<p>

Dim ie<p>

Set ie = GetObject ("", "InternetExplorer.Application")<p>

MsgBox ie.LocationURL<p>

End Sub<p>

When I call it, the MsgBox window is always empty. I've checked in the documentation that I'm retrieving the correct property. I've also tried other properties: locationName also doesn't work, but Parent, for example, does work.<p>

I've also read the docs enough to know that GetObject gets an existing object: I don't want to use CreateObject because I want the URL of the window that's already open, I don't want to create a new window.<p>

I'm running IE 4.0.1 on NT, if that's relevant.
