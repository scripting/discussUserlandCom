I was the Customer Support Manager for Omerga during 1982 and 1983. The program used to copy disks was called LockSmith.<p>

Omega sold thousands of LockSmith copies and allowed users to make backups of the programs they had purchased that did not come with a backup disk. I recall the many different schemes companies used to create software protection and then the escalting situation of defeating those schemes. The use of non-standard Self-Synch bytes, half-tracks, nibble-counting; all a waste of time IMHO.<p>

Eventually, copy-protection faded as companies decided not to employ copy-protection because of the costs involved and consumer complaints.
