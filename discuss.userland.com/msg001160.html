Although the solution was a bit awkward in some places, it actually worked quite well. There was a Frontier dll that started a MS Java VM, and you could send any number of Frontier threads into it to wait for incoming requests. The communication between the Frontier VM and the Java component was done through objectspace Voyager (<a href="http://www.objectspace.com/products/voyager/index.html">http://www.objectspace.com/products/voyager/index.html</a>), but I'd use RMI today. Let me know if you're interested in the code, I'll pack it up and post it on our site.
