I had taken this perhaps more extremely than you had meant, as well:
<blockquote><i>Let's look to the law to fix this "hole". If it isn't tough enough, we make it tougher. Sometimes, a procedural control is better than a functional one.</i></blockquote><p>

I can deal with this a lot better, and agree:<p>

<blockquote><i>some will need both. </i></blockquote><p>

I just want to make sure we don't quit trying to keep the bad guys out merely because there are cops & lawyers to deal with 'em later.<p>
