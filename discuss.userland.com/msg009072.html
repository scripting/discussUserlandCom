Maybe you don't need access to that code but Dave and I have both just given examples of how dangerous it can be to rely on a closed source product. Why would anyone who knows this use or produce closed source software?<p>

Again, I'm new to this business. I guess I've been thoroughly indoctrinated to open source by using Linux and reading Eric Raymond but I don't mean to sound like yet another fanatical open source evangelist. I just haven't heard a good closed source argument yet.
