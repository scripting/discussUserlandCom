IIRC, it was labelled as "extensive", not "exclusive" ;-)<p>

Earlier this year, Microsoft bought a Swedish company called
<a href="http://www.sendit.se/">SendIt</a> for well over $100
million (and made some people I know very rich...).  Among other
things, SendIt owned a trivial but important patent: that you can send long messages by splitting them over multiple 160 byte SMS
messages (!).  More importantly, they also had very good relations
with Ericsson, Nokia, and virtually everyone else in the mobile
universe.<p>

Anyway, based on the remains of SendIt, Ericsson and Microsoft
are now setting up a joint development shop in Stockholm.  The
goal seems to be to use more standard Internet technology on
mobile devices (aka "Microsoft Mobile Internet") -- e.g. supporting HTML as well as WML (aka "Microsoft Mobile Explorer"), using standard
Internet mail technology (aka "Microsoft Mobile Exchange", etc.).<p>

And AFAIK, it has nothing to do with Windows CE.  From what
I've heard, they'll be running the new applications on top
of Epoch.
