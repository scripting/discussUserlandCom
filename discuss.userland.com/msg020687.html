Not that fascinating if you must live under this guy's constant
screw ups.
No one with a healthy, fully functional brain would dare to 
invest a single dollar in this country, which has succeeded in making the world believe that Chavez is some kind of Messiah, when all that we have here is a fake of a Democracy and a lunatic President believing he is Simon Bolivar, the "Liberator".
Fascinating indeed, the fact that no one has yet managed to organize
a real oposition in Venezuela to counter Chavez and his friends.
But again, there's a say that goes like "every country gets the government they deserve", so the consequences are those before-
mentioned in another post: the middle class, the professional 
and educated portion of the population,  that dream of living in a modern country, wishing to improve their lifestyles (and their families') will continue to flee, just like they have been doing for the past 5 to 10 years.
Really sad indeed, let's hope this virus called Chavez doesn't spread to the rest of Central/South America.
