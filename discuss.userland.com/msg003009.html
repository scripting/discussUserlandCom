Some thoughts on this based on your numbering...<p>

1) Could you give me the flow of when the text area would be visible?  You say that a window shouldn't be opened but when will this editor show up?<p>

2) Getting the text from the *home* server is not a problem but to get it from another one is.  I've worked around it by having my RPC handlers called via an applet make the HTTP call to a remote server.  I know it's a hack but it works.<p>

3) This is not a problem at all.<p>

4) If done with the core Java classes, this should be fine as well.<p>

I'll check into the menu because my mind is blanking on construction of menus with applets.<p>

Overall, this could be really cool.  I'll probably start looking at it now.  I'll post when I have something to show.<p>
