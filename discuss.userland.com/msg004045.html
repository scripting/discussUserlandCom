Right now it's either generated as a labor of love (web logs and such) or paid for by advertisement (or at least that's the theory), but in almost every case it's easier for me to remove the ads and just present the data.<p>

Building sites with honestly marked-up XML will make that even easier, so there's no incentive to separate the data from the markup unless giving away the data has value.<p>

Just a concern...
