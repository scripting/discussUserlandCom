I did this because nobody was really interested, the general idea was "very interesting", but a few hours later they're back in Hotline Client 1.2.3 because Frontier+MfHC is much bigger and slower than HC1.2.3 and it looks uglier.<p>

If someone is interested in continuing its development, please tell me and I'll send you the latest version of MfHC.
