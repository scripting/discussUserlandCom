Curiouser and curiouser. If they're aiming to support both Perl and Python, they're serious about going mainstream. I hope they write some good tutorials and lots of example code. Otherwise, my gut tells me they'll have problems getting people up to speed.<p>

Would anybody like me to post some XML files from the E-speak manual?<p>

(What's the current state of open source CORBA support for Python, by the way? I know about Fnord, but I need a non-proprietary solution.)<p>

Cheers,<br>
