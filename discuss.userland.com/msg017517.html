Extend this to search engines via the xml-rpc thingy.  Set up a "query" on your etp site which  every so often searches the net for those keywords and creates in a quadrant of your site the "results" links.<p>

Say you have a sci-fi ETP site. YOu have a box near the bottom of your site which is a table consisting of the top 10 links to keywords "sci-fi, star trek, star wars" which shows it was last searched today at 5am.<p>


Also with auto-syndication, you go to that Author's site, where you see articles which he or she originated. But you _also_ see the articles he/she auto-syndicates, so you see additional links you like!
