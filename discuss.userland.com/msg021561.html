To extend the idea, this is what I was getting at with the references to anonymity in an earlier thread.  An identity brings with it a whole boatload of connotations.  People debating things anonymously tend to take far less offense.  This is also what I mean when I said earlier that I wished my employment hadn't entered into it.  Identity is mostly useless baggage if you are interested in intelligent dialogue.  Actually, you may notice I suggested guaranteed anonymity as a nice feature of a good P2P system.  Thanks for sharing that..
