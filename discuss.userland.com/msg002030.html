Yes, I could expose standard methods on my script objects to enable this but I can't think of a good reason why I should have to do this. The script engine has all the information it needs to do this properly (garbage collection and persistence have a lot in common).<p>

I don't care what format is used (but I'm sure Dave will vote for an XML based format).<p>
