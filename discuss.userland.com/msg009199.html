On the integration of IM into HTML, yes, a special protocol or tag would be cool. Something like <im onmouseover="call jakob nielsen">. Of course that level of encapsulation would be cool for authors.<p>

However, we're not there yet. We need to open up this clam shell and are arguing at the implementation level, whether we need an SDK or only a wire protocol.<p>

The major issue with SDK versus wire protocol is that if I get an SDK then I am stuck, I have to use theirs. If the wire protocol is available then I can write my own 'SDK'.<p>

Closure?
