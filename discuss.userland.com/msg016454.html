Every so often a thread about text editors comes up.<p>

Some of them use Microsoft (not without complaints) but others use emacs or vi, and there seems to be a real fondness for a few ancient DOS editors whose names escape me. WYSIWYG isn't a requirement, given that manuscript submissions tend to be in 12-point Courier.<p>

Personally, I find the text-handling behavior on Windows to be awkward in general, so I prefer writing on a NeXT box.
