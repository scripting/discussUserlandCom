You can't have it both ways, you're presented as the creator of all this stuff, RSS especially, the owner of it, and you have a plan to make your ideas stick. I say as much, and you say somewhat obliquely that I'm doing something unethical. It turns out I got it right, and you still give me shit.<p>

You stepped in the middle, took a leadership position in a technology area I care about, and have been very active in. Part of the reason your work has importance is work that I did, which you probably know little or nothing about.<p>

I'm going to look at what you do every step along the way, and ask questions. You don't have a choice about that. On the phone you said I can't make you change your websites, which I heartily agreed with, and said so. The same rule goes here.
