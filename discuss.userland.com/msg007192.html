You won't get enough cache and disk performance for $500.  And rack mounted chassis are more $ than an ATX case.<p>

Also, use VNC instead of Timbuktu.  Lower RAM footprint, and it's free (GPL). There are clients and servers for all the major platforms, and there's a Java client.<p>

Looks like ORL was bought by AT&T!  oookay.<p>

I've used both TB2 and VNC on my NT boxes, and while VNC only does screen sharing, it does it in a very non-invasive way, system-wise (very little to install, the client is a single .exe file, etc) and it's plenty fast!<p>

I like TB2, I use it on my Macs, but for 7-15 machines, save your money -- that's a whole system for free!<p>
