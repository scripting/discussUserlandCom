An obvious result of a not-very-interesting comparison.  A better comparison would be IIS with an ISAPI extension versus Apache with an Apache module.  Another relevant comparison would be VBScript ASP programs versus mod_perl or PHP3 programs<p>

If you compare CGI on Apache/Unix with CGI on IIS/NT, you will find that IIS loses because of the oh-my-god-its-so-expensive time it takes to launch a process under win32.  You will also find that you don't care because neither will produce satisfactory results and better alternatives are available.<p>
