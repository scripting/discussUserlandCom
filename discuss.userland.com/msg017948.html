I'm watering my garden right now.<p>

In the summer, want to know how much I spend on water?<p>

$400 per fucking month.<p>

Why? Because I like a green lawn and beautiful flowers.<p>

I pay $50 month for cable TV, but all I ever watch are the free channels. <p>

I watch public TV and sad to say most years I don't send them the money. But if were part of my cable bill, I'd do it in a second.<p>

The Web is easy. What I want is for music to be as easy as the Web.<p>

And I want links. Totally know how to do it. I would do a Scripting News rendering for music in a sec. They could embed it in a for-pay site, gotta pony up $30/month to tune into that version. Of course I want a cut of that $30. Only fair, right?
