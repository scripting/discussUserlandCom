At first, I stumbled over it saying "What's Dave talking about now, replacing a language with an OS" (never mind that some would like us to do the opposite, replace the OS with Java). So I stood on my head and read it again from a different point of view. If you're saying replace all references to Java in that piece with Linux, it does make sense. IOW, don't get too wrapped up in the hype.<p>

Hype is bad. If I ever try to sell something, I will be sure not to hype it. It seems that the hype backlash can be as strong as the hype itself in getting into peoples' heads. Memetically speaking. Look at how Marimba has to conduct business now, ducking around the word "push", brilliant people with a great product handicapped with anti-hype, partially a self-inflicted wound. Same story seems to be happening with Java, there's lots of people claiming it's totally worthless, having gotten annoyed with being told it was the answer to everything.<p>

I'm 'watching' the Mets-Braves game 2 as I work thanks to ESPN GameCast and Java. (1-0 Mets in the middle of the 4th.) This is more than just an interesting distraction. Java being used to enable the web, a pretty vital tool that has been overhyped and misunderstood.<p>

Java and Linux are two different kinds of tools that have been taken up and (mis)treated as the 'last, best hope' against a foe, real or imagined depending on your point of view. Let us beat our swords into plowshares.
