My thought exactly. It is great. In fact, I truly believe that Manila is revolutionary. And I'm getting new features already (on my own server too--that root update process is awesome). Hey, UserLand, you're pretty damn good!<p>

Sure, it would be nice if Manila was even more customizable. I have little doubt that it soon will be. UserLand has a solid history of delivering. But, let's stop and think about how much has been accomplished by such a small team. Wow! I wish my own team was that productive.<p>

<i>Many of the people (potential funders) I've discussed Manila hosting with have questioned why it is that the sites look so similar.</i><p>

Hmm..let's see.. Manila opens up the power of dynamic, interactive website production to anyone who can write a minimum of HTML..and we're complaining?<p>

Note to UserLand: I think you are helping to change the world. Congratulations! and Thank You!<p>
