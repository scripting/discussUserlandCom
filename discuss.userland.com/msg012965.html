are very interesting, i have also realized i need to learn a great
deal more about the specific way you think and discuss about topics..
but that's something else alltogether<p>

my Q is: could i update a weblog by using email (say: with template,
authentication, PGP etc.) - or more specific, update/mutate an RSS file using email?<p>

could you envision the yellow pages consisting of a database which generates channel/RSS as a response to a search query? (user entry 
through email.)<p>

(am going to request Frontier for my birthday :-)
