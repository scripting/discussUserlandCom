I have a different idea.<p>

Come up with a site called SpamWorld.Com&trade;.<p>

The whole purpose of the site is to deliberately subscribe to as many channels of spam as possible.<p>

Then index all the spam into a search engine, so people who are truly interested in spam can get all the information about it they could possibly want.<p>

There would be a news page that showed the truly interesting spams every day.<p>

Naturally spammers could pay money (lots of it!) to get their messages on the home page.<p>

There would be a disclaimer of any editorial integrity right on the home page in red for all to see.<p>

What do you think?
