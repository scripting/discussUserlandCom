Basically this puts the DG into read-only mode. If you have a comment you want to post in response to something on Scripting News, post it on some other site, and send me a pointer and I'll read it. If I feel it adds an important fact or point of view I'll point to it on Scripting News. <p>

I don't think people have been getting the point, I'm still spending a lot of time responding to messages that put me in a defensive corner. It's a total waste of my time. If you want improvements in the software, you're defeating your own interest, it takes time to attend to people who are complaining. <p>

So if you have a complaint, find some other space, and we'll do the best we can. If you can somehow *not* express the complaint and tell us specifically what's not working, that would save us even more time, leaving more time to improve the software and our services.<p>

<i>Also, please don't send me email apologizing or flaming or further embroiling me in your needs or emotions. I've given all I can to this. I want a vacation from this discussion group, and sending me private email is probably the worst thing you could do. Please.</i><p>
