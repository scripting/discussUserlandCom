Then we reach the top of one of the peaks of our mutual mountain range. Hope the Zope world takes notice and helps us move this forward.</i></p><p>

<p>Obviously we'll do everything we can to spread the good word.  I 
think the new Zope.org site will replace the existing one early next 
week, so tell Eric to get a membership account and start creating 
news items and links to you folks are doing.</p><p>

<p><i>Jon and I had a discussion, but I brought the idea to Jon, not vice versa.</i></p><p>

<p>My apologies.  Upon re-reading his message I now see it 
correctly.</p>
