Making guava juice into pop-cicles is interesting.  I made 8 of them, only 5 froze, the other three were still 100% liquid.  However when I accidentally knocked a small crystal of ice in the liquid, it crystalized almost the whole thing in about 7 seconds.  I tried it with the two remaining pop-cicles and it was so cool.  <p>

I remember the principle from science class, but it is quite amazing to see it working in real life, and with guava juice of all things. :-)
