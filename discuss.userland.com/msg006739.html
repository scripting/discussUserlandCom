That's rather strange, since as far as I can see, none of the UserLand-supplied scripts that get called when you post a new message refer to a variable named discussionRoot, at least not outside of a try block.<p>

Could you please check whether the message you posted got actually added to the messages table in discuss.root?<p>

Do you have any scripts in config.mainresponder.callbacks.addMessage?
