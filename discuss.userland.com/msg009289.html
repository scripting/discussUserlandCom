would be a configuration file the server would read. Though putting it 
out in public view makes it explicit to smarter clients exactly what's 
being protected.<p>

So who will be the first to write an Apache module to support this? :-)

There is something much more easier I think. But maybe I'm wrong !!!<p>

All the browsers now send the REFERER, so you just need to control
 before with a script if the link is a Universal internal link or if
 it's come from an other website.<p>

So when you click on a trailer with .mpg (or whatever), the server
 could verify if it's come from universal web pages.<p>

my 2 cents.
