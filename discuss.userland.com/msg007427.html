RSS is so limiting because it requires one to adopt a specific writing style, packing everything into one line/link. That&#180;s why I never got into RSS. <p>

I don&#180;t know if it was Netscape&#180;s intention to restrict what RSS can do, or if they just didn&#180;t see the need for a more flexible format, so I have no idea if we can expect Netscape to "fix" RSS. Maybe they think the uniformity of RSS channels is a good thing.<p>

One suggestion: if this is to be widely adopted, it may be a good idea to give it a more general name than scriptingNews. Why not ride that wave and call it the Weblog format?
