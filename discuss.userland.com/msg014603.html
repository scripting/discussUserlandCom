with dreamweaver working as an rpc client, does that give me any direct benefits with fireworks?  <p>

or would there need to be a separate rpc setup for fireworks to work with graphics in manila?<p>

i understand from the product literature that the links between fireworks and dreamweaver are much more robust in the 3.0 versions.  maybe the rpc link to dreamweaver is all i'd need ...
