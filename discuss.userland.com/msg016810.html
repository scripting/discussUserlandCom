I'm not sure I understand your proposal for scanner software.  Is the end goal to get the graphic into Photoshop so you can work with it?  Or is the idea that it kicks it to the web straight off and then from there you can pull it into Photoshop if you need it?<p>

Most scanners these days just implement their interface as a Photoshop plug-in.  Go to Photoshop;  select the scanner from the menu;  hit 'scan';  you get back a Photoshop window that you can save, manipulate, whatever.  Unfortunately Photoshop doesn't do scripting (well, it does, but its an internal scripting, doesn't talk to anything else) or you could tie all of this in to Frontier.<p>

As it is you presumably save the scan as a jpg straight out and then copy it somewhere.<p>

On another note, scanners are now officially <B>cheap</B>.  I bought a Microtek C3 for $50 ($80 + rebate) from Fry's.  The software sucks, but then, all scanner software sucks.<p>
