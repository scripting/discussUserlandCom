The current mostRecentScriptingNews.xml contains examples of each.<p>

The first problem is related to embedded HTML tags.<p>

<text&gt;New channel: BMW Motorcycle Owners of America. <i&gt;Perfect!</i&gt;</text&gt;<p>

The <i&gt; within the text #PCDATA content is properly escaped, but when
I'm rendering this, how do I know that I should "unescape" it in the
HTML I send to the browser?  My software currently displays:<p>

New channel: BMW Motorcycle Owners of America. <i&gt;Perfect!</i&gt;<p>

Now, by looking at it I know that 'Perfect!' should be italicized. What if the content were:<p>

<text&gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Update!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; New tag: &amp;lt;profile&amp;gt; added to
Scripting News DTD</text> ???<p>

In the first case I need to send "<i>Update</i>" to the browser but in
the second I need to send, "<profile&gt;"<p>

My suggestion would be to refine the content model for <text> to define the HTML tags that are allowed, like this:<p>

<!ELEMENT text (#PCDATA|i|em|b)* &gt;<p>

This is a "mixed" content model.<p>

What I'm suggesting is in the spirit of John Cowan's Itsy Bitsy Teeny
Weeny Simple Hypertext DTD (his comment at the top is especially
applicable)<p>

I'd be happy to help with the DTD modifications.<p>

The second problem has to do with "pre-defined" HTML entities.  This
problem is more serious, because it causes a parsing error.<p>

<text&gt;Emmanuel D&amp;eacute;carie, a Mac scripting expert, new to Unix, asks how interapplication communication works on Unix.</text> <p>

The problem is that XML parsers don't (or shouldn't) understand the
&amp;eacute; entity. I'm currently using James Clark's XP and I get the
following message when trying to parse the file:<p>

reference to undefined entity "eacute"<p>

The easiest thing to do would probably be to convert HTML entities to
their numeric equivalent.<p>

&amp;eacute; -> &amp;#233;<p>

Any thoughts?
