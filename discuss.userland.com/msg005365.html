The Advantgo 'edition' of scripting news had definately caught my eye! The same goes for 'channels' on 'my.userland.com' hence my post earlier. We are very impressed by the incredible versatility/power that Frontier exhibits.<p>

One of the content formats that we aim to target is WML - have you heard of anyone using Frontier in connection with WML? We'd like to take HTML content and convert it to WML. WML is the markup language (checkout <a href="http://www.wapforum.org">http://www.wapforum.org</a> for WML specs) used to deliver apps/content/services to the new WAP digital mobile phones from Nokia (7110 alrwady shipping), Ericsson (R380 shown at Cebit) and Motorola (all Motorola mobile phones will be WAP compliant by end 2000) and others. These phones have WML browsers in them...it's a whole new platform...very cool and very exciting.<p>

By the way we need to get into some real prototyping in the near future - we will want to hire a Frontier contractor for this phase. Where is the best place to look for someone?<p>
