(2) The URLs for them are "1.1", "1.2", and "1.3".
(3) You publish a page that holds a link to "1.2", meaning "lou".
(4) A user bookmarks "1.2".
(5) You add a new subtable, "doug".
(6) The user wants to access "1.2" ("lou") but sees "john", because "john" is now the second element in the table.<p>

Isn't this a problem?
(Maybe I just don't understand the URL generation scheme.)<p>
