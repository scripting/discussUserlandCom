The cluster of 100 is just the leaves that a fulltext-search says contain a keyword, is that it?</I><p>

No, it works like this:<p>

Resources have unlimited keywords associated with them, normally chosen by the person adding the resource. These keywords are likely to be similar to meta keywords on web pages, and can offer many different views on the same resource (corresponding to the fact that different people see the same resource from different angles).<p>

The currently selected keywords (like 'news') give a list of resources which use that keyword.  <p>

From this shortlist of resources, their keywords (minus those already selected, like 'news') are listed out and the 100 most popular are displayed.<p>

This means that a user will start by picking some of the more common keywords (like 'news', for example), and then be shown more detailed keywords for their next choice.<p>

BTW, this algorithm uses regular (if complex) SQL, not a full text engine.  Contact me if you want to know more.
