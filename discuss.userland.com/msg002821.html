At this point I am trying to compare things like
frontier, zope (www.zope.com), coldfusion (www.alaire.com), php,
java-ssi, ASP, ASPy (<a href="http://www.dstc.edu.au/aspy/">http://www.dstc.edu.au/aspy/</a>), slashnet, etc.<p>

Some seem to focus more on database enabling a web site, while
others seem more focused on "managing" structure.  <p>

The value of this structure management is ambiguous.  If you intend
to generate pages as templates that are filled in out of a database.
Then all you need is to define a database.  If you need "content editors" to add content to the site, you can just provide web forms for them to submit their content into the database (relational or 
otherwise).<p>

Are there substantive differences between all of these packages,
or is it more like choosing among c compilers -- i.e. they all do more or less the same thing, just tuned to different work rythms? 
More generally, on what bases do you recomend I choose one over the others?<p>

PS There seems to be no obvious place to put a new subject so I
am just responding to an existing one.
