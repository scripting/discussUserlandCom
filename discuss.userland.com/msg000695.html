The Forum Service for Interaction <interaction.in-progress.com> 
was the first XML based threaded forum software for the web. It has been based on extensible markup for several years already.<p>

Interaction keeps all forum messages and configuration as files in XML format, automatically generating HTML pages based on the XML documents and a style sheet.  This makes Interaction a prime candidate for integration with Frontier.<p>

Interaction is a Mac web server companion for dynamic adaptive websites that adapt to the visitors. Interaction has been based on extensible markup since 1995 and was the first application on the Mac platform to commit to the XML standard. Interaction and other Mac XML software are available from www.in-progress.com.
