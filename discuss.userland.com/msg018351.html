I know it also rips to MP3 format, but I believe that's not the default -- you have to choose MP3 explicitly, I believe.<p>

Any more details and information greatly appreciated.<p>

If this rumor is true, this would be a sneaky way to get people "with the program" using only (or preferrably) DRM'd music in preference to MP3'd music.
