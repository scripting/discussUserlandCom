I own one of the Toshiba Portege 3015 subnotebooks and I can't wait to use something like this to make web access seemless in my house.  All of the pieces are coming together.<p>

What is left?  These sub notebooks don't have to get faster -- that isn't a problem.  The screens are beautiful and the hard drives are more than big enough.  I think that battery technology needs to catch up.<p>

Apple touts 6 hours for the iBook.  That is certainly great and it stands out in the field, but I wonder what the battery time looks like when you are using that 11Mb wireless network heavily.  I really want 36 hour+ battery life with heavy wireless network usage.
