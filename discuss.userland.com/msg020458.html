...a 501(c)(3) may not compete directly with private enterprise except for the purpose of fund-raising, and the money raised in this way is considered "unrelated business income" and is taxed. If it amounts to more than 50% of the organization's income, it can't remain a 501(c)(3) non-profit. The FSF states on its Web page that "most" of its income comes from sales of CDs and T-shirts. Therefore, it is not a legitimate non-profit.

I find it hard to believe that the FSF's CD-sale revenue would count, in the IRS's eyes, as competing with private enterprise.  On their Web site, under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/software.html#TOCHowToGetSoftware">"How To Get GNU Software"</a>, they explicitly say that buying CD-ROMs "helps provide the funds for the GNU project", and they also point out that you can get copies by FTP or from a friend.  (And if you don't have a friend who can make a copy for you, <a href="http://www.cheapbytes.com/">CheapBytes</a> sells many different CDs of open-source software for $1.99 each plus shipping.)

Furthermore, one of the reasons that trustbusters worry about predatory pricing is that <i>after</i> the predation has driven all competitors from the market, the new monopoly can raise its prices and collect more profit from the monopoly than it could from a competitive market.  (Remember, antitrust law isn't for the benefit of <i>competitors;</i> it's for the benefit of <i>consumers.</i>)  The FSF can't possibly do that with its software.
<p>
Wide distribution of GPLed software helps the FSF's <i>ideological</i> goals, but it doesn't necessarily help the FSF <i>as a business</i>.  Therefore, your "predation" argument falls flat.
