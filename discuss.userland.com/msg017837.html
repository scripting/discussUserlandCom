I'm a reporter for Forbes. Dave Winer thought you all might help me out on a story I'm writing on music apps. I ran across a website at <a href="http://opennap.sourceforge.net">http://opennap.sourceforge.net</a> that lists a bunch of file sharing apps-- some of which presumably could be used to swap MP3s, etc.--and I was wondering how user friendly they are. I'm behind a firewall, besides being a technical moron, and probably couldn't make them work anyway. Has anyone tried any of these-- Gnutella, Freenet, etc.--to swap files and if so, how'd it go? If you haven't tried them, any volunteers? Any input most appreciated! Feel free to email me <a href="mailto:kblak@mail.com">kblak@mail.com</a>. Thanks.
