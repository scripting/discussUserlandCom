It's repeatedly, rapidly requesting the same documents over and over. Interestingly, it's always WAP pages.<p>

If it was just crawling, it wouldn't be such a problem, it would crawl and move on -- but it's as if it's stuck on a few pages, and it just keeps hitting them.<p>

Naturally, we've taken steps to deal with the issue. But what would be ideal is if their crawler stopped sending these requests.
