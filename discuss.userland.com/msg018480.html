About asking Andy to do anything, I haven't asked him to do that, and I did meet with Eazel when they rolled out, their choice was to have me meet with Mike Boich, the CEO, and a longtime friend (we eat at the same restaurant in Menlo Park). Andy wasn't there. Not a big deal, afaik.<p>

I understand that you liked the idea of Telescript. I didn't like it because it was so hyped and so closed. I hate shit like that. If I were in Andy's shoes (I'm not) I'd clear the air on that chapter of his career, esp if he wants respect in the open source world. <p>

You may not think that stuff like that comes back, but I do believe a lot of important people read Scripting News, and when an issue is raised there these days, it tends to get coverage elsewhere. Not as much as I would like of course, but one step at a time.
