I wouldn't be surprised if Dave hasn't heard of them.<p>

But there's another force at play: the beta program. Most developers do not have access to MacOS X Server; all they have is Rhapsody DR2. Thus their apps haven't been tested on MacOS X Server and you can't ship an app until you've tested it (hopefully). A small, hand-picked group was allowed to test the late betas of MacOS X Server; not surprisingly Apple picked companies with existing NeXT code who are targeting the same makets Apple is: mostly publishing and Web serving. These folks can get their apps out early, while other developers wait impatiently for the official release.
