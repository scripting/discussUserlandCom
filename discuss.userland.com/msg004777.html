They are designed to be printed, so we have addressed at least some of your concerns.<p>

An evaluation of the current product should be based on the product, right?<p>

If you want a preview of the docs that are included, they are on the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tree$2.1">web</a>. Personally, I think they meet all your stated objectives.
