I am one of the engineers who does the xml/js/xul for the instant messaging part of Netscape 6.<p>

I'm more than happy to help out with getting a sidebar rss version for scripting news.  You can put _any_ page in a sidebar, so if scripting news outputted a page which was narrow and tall - rss or not - it could live as a sidebar...<p>

And in terms of having the install spew stuff all over your system... NS6 is a almost 100% completely re-written browser.  Bloat is gone.
If you did the install you would see something amazing - some few core objects, plus lots of .js and .xul files - which is how the browser shows its UI.  You could create a completely Manila-centric viewer using just XUL and JS.  Plus if folks already had NS6 (or Mozilla) all they would need to download from here would be those small text files.<p>

Anyway - I'm just really happy that I can tell folks what I do for a living finally. ";->"<p>

It's a big day here at Netscape...
