Basically, they feel that Third Voice is a purely personal endeavor.<p>

Well, I ask them, which does Third Voice have more in common with?<p>

<UL>
<LI><B>Marking up your own copy of a photo:</B> You are the only person with the change.  It cannot be distributed to everybody else who owns that photograph.  It does not affect the value of the work in any way to the original owner (assuming you have a legal copy in the first place).  In short, the distribution of the change is 1 person.</LI>
<LI><B>Marking up a copy and distributing the new photo:</B> Many people have the change.  It can be distributed to anybody who does whatever is necessary to aquire it.  It affects the original value of the work (in lost sales and bad impressions, amoung other legally recognized losses).  In short, it has a distribution of potentially millions.</LI>
</UL><p>

The first is OK. The second is not.<p>

Which is Third Voice?  It is the second, in terms of what it does.  If it was a purely personal thing that is only an issue of how the user chooses to view things, then I would ever bit as upset about Third  Voice as I am when people view my site(s) with Lynx (which is to say, not at all).  But the annotation is a public thing, not a private.<p>

(To split hairs, I do sort of agree with these people in one regard; it may well be "OK" to view the annotations as a person.  What is not legal would be posting in such a fashion that it can affect millions of people, legal or otherwise.  Or creating content that acts similarly.  So, you may have the "right" to view what nobody has the "right" to create!)
