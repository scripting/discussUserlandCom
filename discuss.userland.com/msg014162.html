Is there some way to create a guided feedback loop? <p>

As folks take manila out and change it around, are there metrics of usefulness the systems can capture and pass back? how far down a thread do people go? how much do active posters post? how many people post at least once? how many people get lost or distracted? adjust for age/native-language or other factors and you have measures of engagement. metrics will tell you something good (or bad) is going on so you know where to look for tweaks that make a difference. <p>

A standard feedback form for users, results posted in xml for aggregation and analysis back at the mother ship? <p>
