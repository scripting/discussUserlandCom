1. Content (latest news and information for the relevant sector)
2. Database of items, previous purchases etc for clients of the site.
3. E-commerce section with a catalog of products and the ability to select/purchase online.<p>

We will be using Frontier for 1 and probably 2. But what about 3. Is it worthwhile developing Shopping Cart functionality etc for Frontier or should we use other software specifically intended for that purpose? And what about connecting to a payment gateway from Frontier - has anyone done this?<p>

Your views are welcome.<p>
