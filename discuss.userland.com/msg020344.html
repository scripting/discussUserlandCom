<strong>What will happen to the FreeBSD codebase? Is it going to merge with the BSDI code, or vice-versa? Will
           there be two code trees?</strong>
<P>
           There are plans for the two codebases to merge, but not immediately. FreeBSD 4.0 is scheduled for release very soon [4.0
           should go gold on March 13th -- Nik] and will not contain any code from BSD/OS. Once 4.0 becomes the "stable" branch,
           the merging work will begin on the "current" branch. There will also be continuing improvements and enhancements to the
           proprietry BSD/OS.
<P>
           Jordan adds: I also see us best doing this by gradual convergence, not by simply attempting to ram one group or code-base
           into another. It will take time for the FreeBSD developers to come up to speed on the various features in BSD/OS they may
           be merging and the converse is true for the BSDI developers; they've been working on BSD/OS for the last decade and will
           need time to familiarize themselves with the FreeBSD code base, its development methodologies and its culture.
<P>
           There are a number of FreeBSD features which existing BSD/OS customers have requested just as there are a number of
           BSD/OS features which the FreeBSD project will be looking into merging. By doing this work in parallel, we can deal with
           the familiarization issues on both sides while making the eventual code merger progressively easier.
<P>
           David Greenman and Mike Karels will be working together as co-architects for the new system. As features are merged
           in, they will be available for download at www.freebsd.org, and on "snapshot" CDROMs. The completely merged system
           will be released as FreeBSD 5.0.
</blockquote>
<P>
In short, much but not all of the code will be combined. BSD/OS will retain unique, value added components.
<P>
Now, kindly stop spreading FUD.
