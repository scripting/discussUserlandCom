I deal with a lot of people who are still very cautious on how to use a computer on the internet.  This is exactly what they will be looking for.  I think we forget sometimes that over 40% of the US population (and even more outside) still haven't used the internet.  It makes a lot of sense to simplify access into one 'family' type portal.  These new itools seem to be a stroke of genius.  They (Apple) hardly provide any of the content but rely on the web (which is where eWorld went wrong) to provide content.<p>

I suspect within two months you'll see Microsoft, hackers or Apple itself provide a way to access iDisk without a Mac.  It may appear not to be open source but the underlying protocols are, so its only a matter of time.<p>

I would say that the main people who will take advantage of it aren't US users, but European or Asia users, and that is where Apple could make a hell of a lot of money.<p>

PS.  And less we forget, nearly every PC manufactuer has its own internet provider (Gateway etc..) so its not as if Apple is the only one going down this route.
