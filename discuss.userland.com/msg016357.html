His conclusion? That anyone running, or providing internet access to a web server likely to host sites containing contentious material will need to prepare a bloody good defence against the charge that they "publish" defamatory material. As the law currently stands, even links to sites outside the jurisdiction of the UK courts can be regarded as "publication".<p>

Basically, UK ISPs are scared witless by the threat of litigation, with good reason, so they're rolling down the shutters. Warms the cockles, no?
