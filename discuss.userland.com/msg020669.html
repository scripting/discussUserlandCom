At $99 for education it's pretty hard to beat. The teachers and students should be pretty happy with it. Apple makes most of the money. What a gift. How could they turn it down?</I><p>

I didn't realize it was cheaper for educators! You're not kidding that it would be hard to beat. I sent the letter to our Apple SE, & cc'ed you. Lets see what happens, in least in this little part of the world.<p>

We've been having monthly evening dog & pony shows for our weblogs server, & everyone gets jazzed up when they see it.<p>

We're talking to a local Credit Union that is a customer, and they are thinking about offering weblogs to their customers as a benefit. They've got 20,000 people! If this becomes reality, you'll have to let me know how to scale it!<p>

The more people we show it to, the more things happen. It's fun to watch.<p>

As a little local ISP, we figure that it's an additional service we can offer our customers. Something to set us apart from AOL and other big providers.<p>

In a way, if a school or this credit union installs their own server, it diminishes my local uniqueness. But I figure the goodwill I get by showing people cool stuff like Manila will keep them loyal down the road. We've been around since 1987, so I guess it works. ;-)
