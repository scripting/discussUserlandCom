You've made a comment regarding your 'new' application being perhaps more powerful than those used by radio DJ's. Are you aware that the software used by these people allows them to do things like:<p>

 - specify the mood of music to play (eg, only play bright and cheerful songs this hour)<p>

 - set an hourly maximum of female artists<p>

 - or play no more than one female in a row<p>

 - be careful not to shift between moods too quickly<p>

 - only play songs above a specified tempo.<p>

 - or play mostly songs from a certain year, or of a certain style, or of a certain length<p>

 - track everything via a song history (including artist and style history also)<p>

 - graph sequences around the clock to track what style is being played when<p>

If your software can do these things, then leave your statement as is. Otherwise, I urge you to modify your statement. You've created a sharable playlist (which has been done before), not something "more powerful than professional radio station software."<p>
