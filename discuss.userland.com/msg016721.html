Another week and the numbers look even worse.  For week of 3/27 to 4/2. % downtime ranges from 0.26 to 42.21 with an avg of 6.65. (Internet World May 1st, 2000, page 26) [Current issue is NOT yet up on the Web, but my guess is URL will be <a href="http://www.internetworldnews.com/idx_article.asp?inc=050100/5.01Performance&issue=5.01">http://www.internetworldnews.com/idx_article.asp?inc=050100/5.01Performance&issue=5.01</a>]<p>

After reading about your experience with Conxion and your looking for highly available Internet connectivity, I saw a table in Internet World magazine under a new light.  They have a "Web Performance Index" table that lists 39 web sites and reports the % of time that they could not get some or all of a home page for a specific site for a week.  Looking at the April 15th, 2000 issue, page 30  or here on the web <<a href="http://www.internetworldnews.com/idx_article.asp?inc=041500/4.15Performance&issue=4.15">http://www.internetworldnews.com/idx_article.asp?inc=041500/4.15Performance&issue=4.15</a> > which is for the dates 3/13-3/19 they show a range of 0.23% to 15.94% down time.  Their average is 2.72% down time.
The data in this table in provided by Keynote <<a href="http://www.keynote.com/">http://www.keynote.com/</a>>.
