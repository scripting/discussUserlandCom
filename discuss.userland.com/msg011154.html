I'm not sure why, but a publicly-accessible archive is a hot button for a lot of women. It's been suggested in the past, and the answer from several subscribers was an emphatic NO!.<p>

There is a digest though, and you can subscribe to that from the same <a href="http://www.chalcedony.com/wisewomen/">web page</a>.
