If you study lots of sites, you'll see there <i>are</i> a common set of requirements. "Never" is a long time. Usually when you think something will never happen, it's already happening. Life is funny that way.<br><br>	I'm betting that content management <i>is</i> a mass application. Otherwise we're going to be stuck only with pubs that can afford expensive and hard to keep running one-off CMSes. I don't think it'll shake out that way. <br><br><b>CMS-Vendor discussion<a name="cmsvendorDiscussion">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/08#cmsvendorDiscussion" title="Permanent link to 'CMS-Vendor discussion' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	On the CMS-Vendor list, <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/cms-vendor/25">Stephen Tyler posted</a> a lengthy summary of the issues between content management systems and various kinds of crawlers, including the bursty kind, RSS readers, users with defective site-grabbers, and the search engines. <br><br>	I posted a <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/cms-vendor/26">response</a> where I explain our immediate concern with the search engine crawlers, and note a performance improvement in the engine behind Weblogs.Com. <br><br><b>Weblogs.Com performance<a name="weblogscomPerformance">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/08#weblogscomPerformance" title="Permanent link to 'Weblogs.Com performance' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	Here's how I found the optimization for "Weblogs.Com". <br><br>	I looked at the calendar, and noticed that almost half of the sites hadn't changed in over a <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/calendar/2000/10/01">week</a>. Some hadn't changed at all in <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/calendar/2000/07/25">months</a>. Yet we're reading every one of those sites every hour, to see if they've changed, and changes seem to become less likely as the weeks and months go by.<br><br>	The new algorithm is more patient. If a site hasn't updated in over seven days, it only sends out one request every 24 hours. They don't all come at once since we retain the time of the last update, we only send the request out in the hour they last updated, which should scatter the requests fairly evenly over a 24 hour period.<br><br>	When an inactive site becomes active, it might take 23 hours before we detect the change. That's the tradeoff. If you want us to check every hour, update at least once a week.<br><br>	Since the inactive sites also tend to be slower (lots of timeouts) the net increase in performance was over 400 percent. This means that Weblogs.Com finishes its scan after three or four minutes. It was getting close to fifteen minutes per scan!<br><br><b>Today's baseball poetry<a name="todaysBaseballPoetry">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/08#todaysBaseballPoetry" title="Permanent link to 'Today's baseball poetry' in archives."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"></a></b><br><br>	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/08/sports/08FANS.html">Signs</a> of philosophic weakness in NY. <br><br>	"If it can't be the Yankees, God forbid, then I hope it's the Mets because it's still New York." <br><br>	See what I mean about Yankees fans? <br><br>	God <i>does</i> forbid. Ambivalence yields earthquakes. Let me tell you a <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod">story</a>. Pick a team, go down with the ship, if necessary. Of course when a team has a deep philosophy, that's often not necessary. (And there's always next year.)<br><br>	A reader unfamiliar with the philosophy of the Mets asked if Bobby Valentine was a spiritual leader. <br><br>	"Not really," I said. "But <a href="http://baseball-almanac.com/quosteng.shtml">Casey Stengel</a>, now there was a deep thinker and a man of peace."<br><br>	Marc Canter, a man without a team, asked "What's the philosophy of the Mets?"<br><br>	"<a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/krsanjose/20001008/lo/13th-inning_hr_gives_mets_second_straight_extra-inning_win_leaving_giants_down_2-1_and_one_loss_from_elimination_1.html">Love</a>," I said.<br><br>
