To interpret my statement as one based on you changing is to say that I believe that you <i>want</i> bitterness and exclusivity in the community, and I've been <a href="http://news.userland.com/1997/04/01">reading you long enough</a>, and have talked to you enough, to know that that's probably not the case.  I just was blindsided by the comments about Derek, who has always seemed pretty gracious to me.  That's it, nothing more; I pointed to the MetaFilter site because it seemed to be collecting "the other side," as it were.<p>

And, if you must know, the fact that the <i>ER</i> comment was above the comment about this controversy put it in its relative place -- beneath a popular TV show (which really isn't that high on the social cause registry).<p>

And lastly, no... <i>you</i> have a grrrrreat weekend.<p>
