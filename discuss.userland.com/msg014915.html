Although the screen shots have been taken down at the original site, <a href="http://www.observers.net/kenton/index2.htm">observers.net</a> has a mirror.<p>

NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/02/biztech/articles/04ford.html">Ford Offers Workers PC's and Internet Service for $5 a Month</a>. "Includes color monitors, speakers, technical support and ample capacity for workers and their families to create their own Web sites." <i>Good thinking!</i><p>

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$164">Nick Denton</a> of Moreover.Com was at Davos.<p>

As were the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$165">founders</a> of utok.com. We talked briefly, they said they were doing something different from ThirdVoice. I promised we'd take a look. <p>

A single page with <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$187">pictures</a> from Saturday's demonstration. The story is told in the DaveNet piece I'm working on.<p>

<i>Hint: Ford should give their employees digital cameras too.</i><p>

Many thanks to Sam Devore for letting me use his mail server to send out two DaveNets today.<p>

Starting at 10AM in Amsterdam, 1AM in California. I'm going to get a whole day's work in before you guys even wake up. There's an advantage to being European. BTW, today's my last day as a European. I fly to Boston tomorrow. I'll spend much of today finishing my Davos writing (lots of stuff coming) and preparing my talk for Monday.<p>

A slow dialup connection is fine for editing a Manila site, I'm finding. Even picture uploading isn't too torturous.
