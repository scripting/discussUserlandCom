James Spahr, who's working for us now, has a DreamWeaver integration kit, but to really work, I think *some* of it has to be shipped by Macromedia to make it easy. They've done an excellent job of supporting open interfaces, but connecting to an XML parser and HTTP client from DreamWeaver requires a fair amount of software to be in the right place. The more that's directly in DreamWeaver, the more likely that people will use it.
