Part of the definition of open source developer. No patents.<p>

Another part. Credit for prior art. If the program is derived from the functionality of another program, whether or not it's open source, credit is given in the docs. Leave a trail behind, say whose shoulders you're standing on, not just for code, but for designs and ideas.<p>

In other words, open source is the exact inverse of patented software. You're expected to research prior art and disclose it, but not make any intellectual property claims of your own.
