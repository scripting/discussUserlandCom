I assume that MSNBC must be paying quite a bit of money for their editors, but how could they allow this survey to go live? It doesn't make any sense at all!

Actually it makes perfect sense.<p>

That is <I>exactly</I> what they are <U>paid</U> to do.  (And not just at MSNBC ...)  These organs are more about <i>shaping</i> the collective perception and dialogue, than reporting of news.  And a primary goal is the blunting of the American mind.  <p>

This agenda primarily aims to establish a false dichotomy (Rats vs Pigs) to deflect attention from the real issues and conflicts in society.  This has been the case for the past 21 years that I have been here and observing the media in this country.<p>

Think of it:  Here is the most the powerful nation on earth, about to elect their leader for the next 4 years.  What does the media focus on? <p>

Rats.<p>

The Kiss !!!<p>
